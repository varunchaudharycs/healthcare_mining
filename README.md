Project Directory Structure:
- ./CODE directory has all the codes of all the components we used for the entire project. Each component has it's own README.MD/txt which describes the steps to setup and run the project.
- ./EVALUATIONS directory has test queries we used to evaluate our implementation accuracy and all the findings.
- ./DATA directory has link to the crawled data. As the data size were huge we planned to store in drive and make it accessible by sharing it.
