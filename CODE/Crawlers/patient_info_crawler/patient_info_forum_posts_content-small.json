There are dry mouth sprays or lozenges you can buy, I have never tried them so I don't know how good they are. If you are perimenopausal age I am assuming you are in your 40s which is very young for Alzheimer's. If you drink alcohol in the evening you are more likely to get a dry mouth or also if you suffer with allergies and your nose is a bit runny or blocked. Some medications can give you a dry mouth too. As your oestrogen levels drop you will get a dryer mouth and eyes so it could be a symptom of the perimenopause, do you notice it is worse at certain times of the month?",

        "post_content": "Age: 22 Sex/Gender: Male Height and weight: 200lbs 5'11 Race/Ethnicity: Ethiopian (& mixed descent) Geographic location: USA Pre-existing medical issues: None ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, really need your opinion or what you guys think since it's been 7 weeks since the onset of these symptoms & multiple tests have been done with no diagnosis thus far. **The First Symptoms** When symptoms first started it started off with testicular aches, pain in pubic area, flank area & lower abdomen, Pains would come & go like searing hot pain, extreme tenderness in those area, etc. Naturally I thought it was a urology issue & did multiple testicular exams, blood markers,etc and came back clean. **Now here is where the plot thickens.** While the groin issue was happening I start to experience other symptoms which seem unrelated and come & go. Well those new symptoms are what I'm stuck with now & the unexplained groin symptoms have been absent the past 2 weeks (after being there for 5 weeks) **Instead the symptoms I have now are:** * Both ribs, especially lower ribs feeling bruised for no reason. The tenderness of ribs can be felt in the front ribs, side of body and can be traced all the way to the back if pressed. * Unexplained non injury back pain started in upper left back & has now progressed to entire upper back and mid back. Feels like almost like an injury pain. Present pretty much all day but pain will vary in areas of the back or how mild it can be throughout the day * Sometimes the rib & back can have a weird achy feeling all at once together and come on out of nowhere. The ribs, side of ribs, back will ache all at once and not even lying down helps. The ache can leave you feeling sick and queasy until it's gone. * This also comes and goes. But the actual lung itself sometimes feels exhausted, sore, and achy. There are times I will wake up with what feels like the lung is on fire. That symptom will sometimes be replaced with an achy sore feeling. Especially for example if I bend my upper body for a few seconds and come back up right the lung will feel sore & weak. Again these symptoms can disappear for a few days before they come back again. I've noticed thou if symptoms are present it's usually the worst in the morning after waking up. * In the upper left abdomen area I experience a very weird pain like someone is holding a pencil from inside and poking against one of the organs under or next to left rib. Again not to be mistaken with the other rib pain. This symptom is an actual upper left abdominal pain sensation. Usually I felt that mild pain after eating when this started. But today felt it for no reason when I woke up and was the worst I've felt that pain as it was way more noticeable & not just mild * A slight dry cough had started 5 weeks back, it has now progressively gotten worse. And although long amount of hours can pass by without me coughing. When the dry cough does happen, it's more deeper, developed and stronger, * I've had unexplained loss of appetite & nausea that came & went. Just 3 weeks ago I experienced 4 days of loss of appetite & mild nausea that'd come & go. Disappeared for 3 days then came back hard for 2 days with heavy nausea,early satiety & dizziness that lasted 2 days. Then disappeared for 1 week then came back for 2 days as just mild loss of appetite and currently gone again **Tests done so far** * Ultrasound of testicle = Right Only Varicocele found * Kidney ultrasound: Clean * Urine test: Clean of any infections,etc * MRI of abdomen & pelvis= Came with slightly enlarged inguinal lymph nodes * CAT Scan of abdomen/pelvis found nothing before the mri * Blood tests: Lipid panel, A1C, STDs, inflammation makers, h pylori bacteria, Complete blood count, white blood cell differential, lipase, calcium level, D-Dimmer all came back normal except for slightly elevated triglycerides & cholesterol from lipid panel * Chest Xray= normal So I'm currently at loss of what these weir symptoms and how they all relate. I'm trying to push for an upper endoscopy & an upper mri from the doctors. But not sure what else to do besides that. Do you guys have any idea what can cause this? I've went from completely healthy 22 years old to bizzare symptoms that have been 7 weeks so far.",

My work involves me sitting on the desk all the day too since I work for myself. But it'd be pretty crazy if this was all from poor posture. I mean the backpain coming on suddenly and rib pain. Let's say that's from poor posture and just never noticed it and these weird symptoms decided to just onset one day randomly for no reason. But that still doesn't explain the sore lung feeling, the dry cough, the weird left upper abdominal pain, the loss of appetite that comes and goes..the old groin symptoms,etc. Or maybe they're all different conditions? Some caused by poor posture or different cause and some caused by something else and so on. It is likely we have multiple causes for different symptoms and they may not all be related but when jumbled up together it's hard to distinguish which symptom belongs to what cause. I have no idea. If any body else has input as well, would love to hear it. Even if you guys never experienced all the symptoms I listed in my op. Even if you experienced some of them, please contribute since everything helps",

I have always thought the symptoms were connected to multiple things. my new big thing is pain in my right leg, including in front and behind the knee. some days it goes away but more often than not it is painful. There is also a vein protruding out the back of the knee, but mg doctor felt it said she is not concerned. I also had D dimmer and they said that rules out blood clot. especially since it was well below 200ng/ML. I apologize for my delay it was a busy day at work! going to eat with family and then I will respond to your other message. Hope you are staying safe during all this COVID stuff!",

        "post_content": "hi everyone. So the last 5 days or so I've been having some odd abdominal issues. it seems to have come out of nowhere. For the last 5 days I have been getting full quickly. a few bites and my stomach is bloated (even with drinking water!) My hunger has somewhat diminished as well. ive been noticing its taking a long time for my food to digest. if i eat a meal at 6 pm the night before, ill hear grumbling sounds until i use the bathroom the next day at like 12 pm. Usually my metabolism is quicker than that. Now that didnt worry me too much the last 4 days, until last night when i got really scared. After I tried eating a half a burger and like three fries, i had to use the bathroom. After i defecated, i noticed maroon colored blood on the toilet paper. not a lot, but definitely there. like i mentioned, i havent defecated often in the last 5 days, and when i do its usually soft, leaning towards diarrhea. i never bled until last night. It also feels like my abdomen wants to expand at all times even when i havent eaten a meal (whatever that means). I have no nausea, no fever, no coughing...although a little chest pain right in the middle of my chest and/or sternum especially after eating a meal. What could be going on here? 5'7 29 years old Male 173 lbs On a side note: I like to point out that these specific symptoms started the day after i went to the chiropractor...not sure if that means anything. i also took a Comprehensive blood test a month ago for other reasons and my blood count was within normal ranges...i dont know how that affects my development of my abdominal issues",

The coronavirus can give you digestive symptoms. I don't know if you would get symptoms the next day from contracting it though, but if you think it is ok to have an appointment with a chiropractor during this crisis, I am going to assume you may not have taken other precautions before. This virus is highly contagious and just touching an item someone with the virus has touched and then touching your face can give you this virus. You need to speak to a medical professional to explain your symptoms, I would advise to do this by a phone call so if you do have the virus you don't spread it further. Also if it turns out you do have the virus warn everyone you have come in contact with especially the chiropractor, who could spread it to multiple clients after you. People really need to take this seriously, the death toll keeps rising because people don't think the rules apply to them.",

        "post_content": " Hi, i'm an 18 year old male. I wish i could keep it shorter than this but i felt the need to mention all this. A couple months ago (mid February), i developed a sudden pain (it was fairly intense) in my intestines( which lasted 2-3 days) accompanied by bloating, excessive gas, unsatisfactory and incomplete bowel movements (with a very small drop of blood on the toilet paper everyday for a week). I also experienced heartburn and acid reflux that one night (It never happened again though), so i immediately scheduled an appointment with a Gastroenterologist. He assured me it was nothing but an upset GI tract because of my poor eating habits prior to the discomfort. So he prescribed me a few medicines for the same. The major symptoms like severe intestinal pain, excessive gas and bloating and that little bleeding i had resolved within a week or so. But other symptoms like change in bowel habits (it\u2019s mushy and thinner than it used to be), minor abdominal discomfort (occasionally) still persist to this day. When i google the symptoms it seems to be an episode of IBS or inflammation in the gut but this persistence also raises a small possibility of colon cancer which has me worried. Also there are few factors to consider before reaching a conclusion: (1). I was on a very poor and undernourished diet with lots of low quality processed fats and oils (lot of junk food basically) for a few months ( i live in a hostel and i didn\u2019t like the food there). Though, now i\u2019ve been at home for a month and half and my diet is mainly healthy home-made food, i keep myself fairly hydrated. (2). I have been skipping breakfast for almost an year now (poor routine management). (3). I had been hooked to smoking since 7-8 months before these symptoms appeared (i quit now). Haven\u2019t touched a cigarette for a couple months now. (4). Both my grandfathers (Maternal and Paternal) were heavy smokers and died at approximately age 65, but were never diagnosed of cancer of any type. No once in my family (except my 43 year old mother) ever had cancer. About my mother, She was diagnosed with stage 2 uterine cancer 4 years ago (then 39) but was cured and is perfectly fine now. (5). I also developed Tonsillitis a couple weeks after my gut discomfort arised. Which, again resolved within a week. But i still find a dense white mucus consistently from my nose which leads me to believe a possibility of infection in my body. Thank you for reading it up until this point. I appreciate any helpful answers on what could this situation possibly be. :) ",

Since you had a poor diet that's probably what triggered it. That's what you have to figure out is what triggers your IBS. PAY ATTENTION to which foods make your pain worse. And of course dont ever eat those foods. My daughters food trigger is fruit...especially citrus but everybody is different. Oh and go off of gluten and dairy for week and add it back in to your diet and see what happens. I know a lot of people with IBS that cant handle gluten or dairy so play around with foods and see what you can figure about what you can handle and what you cant. Hope you feel better.",

I became quite healthy after 2 months. Now again feeling stomach problems related to gastritis. i feel very hungry but when i eat, i feel full after a small meal specially after afternoon meal. then starts dysphagia, shortness of breath, dizziness (my head spins), tremor in hands and a little bit sweating on them. does anyone else feel the same? after an hour i feel hungry again.. cannot eat oily, greasy and heavy foods. in the night time, hunger increases more strongly. can anyone help?",

It is able to burrow into the lower layers of the stomach, making it hard to kill. The pepto bismal makes it vulnerable to the anti biotics, I wonder if your BP is being affected by anxiety of your situation, or if you had eaten a high salt meal before taking the reading. Have you had your blood sugar checked to make sure you are not diabetic as well. I have a home kit I use, I am not diabetic but prone to low blood sugar at times. Been that way for years. .maybe call your advice nurse/doctors office for a phone consult. Also do come deep breathing , breath in through your nose, out through your mouth, slowly and deeply. Do this at least 10 times, and watch funny movies and relaxing things, not the news. hang in there, if you cant get through to your doc, and feel unwell go to the ER, wear a mask and gloves of come kind, try to stay away from people, do the best you can, but if you are having an medical emergency. go in. hope u feel better, many things can effect out blood pressure. Are you on any meds that have this as a side effect....:) ",

        "post_content": "I am a 23 year old male. A little over a year ago, right after we moved, I began having recurrent runs, I wont get graphic but they were very explosive, a lot of mucus and watery sometimes even pure water. They were one and done most times though. I would have a blowout after a couple hours of bad cramps and be fine the next day. completely normal bowel movement etc. this happened about once or twice a month for about 10 months and then suddenly got much more frequent about once a week for a month and then it got better. I went about three months with minor cramps and no episodes and then it returned once at Christmas (maybe alot of food i dont normally eat?) since then I had another blowout a couple months later and once a month after that. I have been to my pcp, he did a lot of bloods and took a stool sample, the sample was normal, the only oddity in my blood was mildly low B12, so he tested me for the celiac gene, that cane back negative as well. My B12 has since returned to normal (low normal) without treatment. He said he thinks i have IBS given that my symptoms tend to be eased by a movement (according to him Chrons would continue to be painful after a movement) and the fact my inflammatory markers were low. (he said often times if someone with Chrons is having a flare up their markers will be 70-80 on whatever metric they use. mine was 6) I guess i just want input from those who live with IBD because the symptoms seem very much to overlap and I am concerned about something more. Like i said the cramps can really hurt but mostly go away (besides a residual muscle pain) after a movement. The movements are very loose and watery and have even dissolved before it was so loose. then literally the next day or day after completely back to normal. Sometimes I will have bad cramps and only a tiny amount of loose stool that relieves it. I have been under alot of stress the last year and i know that contributes to IBS and it started after moving so there was a major change there. Just looking for opinions. look i understand that it most likely is IBS, my doctor does know his stuff and has done pretty much every test but a CT or colonoscopy. On top of that I understand that IBS is very common and IBD is rare. I just am worried about some condition sneaking up on me as i have seen family have that happen before. ",

My doctor also said my symptoms dont warrant a colonoscopy given i have no weightloss, blood shows no inflammation, symptoms go away after gas or stool passing and there was no blood in stool. While i do worry i have to agree with him there. That would be like performing an appendix removal for minor right abdominal pain with no otger symptoms. yes on paper it somewhat lines up but there is no evidence supporting anything more. on top if that with IBS i wouldnt even consult a dietitian. I would work on stress etc. ",

        "post_content": "Hello everyone, I'm 22 boy and for 2 years I'm struggling with an upset stomach. In my last year of apprenticeship I lived alone and I had to eat only ready meals and junk food. I just didn't know how to cook. Symptoms that I developed and recently worsened: - Bloating (Everyday) - Constipation (Everyday) - Upper middle and left abdominal pain (Sometimes) - Frequent bowel movements (8-15 times a day) - Bowel incontinence - Incomplete bowel movement feeling - No blood at all but sometimes mucus - Lack of energy, tiredness Blood and all those simple tests were fine, I had even a negative IBS poo test. Recently I had to call my GP for a next step - gastroscopy but because of coronavirus I'll have to wait a while. So until I get that camera test I thought it would be a good idea to post here for an opinion. So... everything is fine until I lean down. I work in construction industry... but not heavy weights are the problem. When I lean down I fell I'm putting pressure on my stomach and then I need to get to the toilet. If you could give me an idea of what it could be... I'd be grateful. Thank you, take care!",

In the last 10 years, it helped me get rid of many uneven things in my body and I have learned more from it, by teaching me only to listen to my brain, what is only good for me and not others and I can give you the same adwise to listen to yourself and the first hunsh is always the best. Don't second yourself and don't let others tell you what is good for you, but sometimes ask a doctor questions that you have and that are a concern of yours. It helped me.",

        "post_content": "Hey Everyone... So I've had reflux for about two years now. For the most part it was manageable and then beginning last year I had a bachelors and the next day I was vomiting constantly and it felt like I was about to die. After that day, I've constantly had reflux symptoms such as the hoarse throat and burning stomach. About five months ago, my doctor put me on nexium for about a month and it did not seem to work. Then after that, he put me on lansoprazole twice a day for 5 days and the once a day for a month. I started to realise halfway through using the lansoprozole that I developed a weird chest sensation. It would come and go. It was a type of stabbing pain the one moment and a tightness the next. But only about once or twice an hour for about 2 or 3 minutes and then go away. I had an ECG and chest enzyme blood work done. The ECG came back clean and the blood work as well, she did say that it looked like there was some form of muscle strain from the blood, but that it might be due to something else and she was not worried. An ultrasound did show that my spleen was 13,7 cm so a bit enlarged but she was also not worried. This chest pain has been plaguing me now for about 3 months. It also feels sometimes that my heart beets really hard and I get this sinking feeling in my heart about once a day. Went to the doctor and he put me on a b2 blocker for it and that took the sinking away but not the hard poundings. I don't really feel the chest when I exercise or anything so it doesn't make it worse. I do feel it though when I try to lift something heavy sometimes but its manageable and I'm not too worried about that. I am worried about my chest though because its all I think about sometimes and it stresses me out because I don't know what it is. My throat also does not get better. On another note which I don't know if it is related or not, about once a week or so, especially at night or if I'm lying in bed, I get this strange feeling in my head. Like a batch of light-headedness coupled with this feeling of heightened senses. It was like my senses are so heightened that I scare when anyone sneezes or anything near me. Could be totally unrelated but thought I should mention. I'm just getting tired of being sick or not feeling well! My diet is not perfect, but its also not like I eat fast food every day or week.. Sounds like there is a lot wrong with me and it could be all due to stress, but here in South Africa doctors are not that clued up on Gerd and all that stuff and G-Scopes are expensive. You guys are one of my only hopes.... ",

You have to watch what time you take the baking soda as it neutralizes your acids in stomach so dont eat after you take it. I usually drank a cup of water before bed with a small pinch of the baking soda and depending on how severe yours is it'll take a couple of weeks to heal. You sound stressed out!! Stress can cause heart racing, chest pains, and LOTS of other things especially since you said you think about all that's bothering you alot. It's hard not to worry about your health. Sounds like you have ruled out heart problems with the test you've had. That's good! Medications that your taking could possibly be making things worse?? lightheadedness, heart racing, weird feelings in your head..but I will say that I think it's just stress if I had to guess because you said you were jumpy and scare easily. I get stressed and can tell I scare easily too. Try some stress relievers..pray, workout, etc whatever it is that makes you smile and laugh. Hang in there and prayers for you to feel better!",

Yesterday morning I started with bad cramps and then diarrhea. It got better after an hour or so but I still felt unwell. This morning the cramps and diarrhea were much worse and I ended up in bed most of the day. I'm a male in my 30's and although I'm not overweight or unhealthy I am a heavy drinker (particularly since Covid lockdowns!) and a smoker. Does this sound like it could be kidney or similar? Is there anything I should do to try and ease it? I don't want to make a GP appointment at this time because of the strain on the health service. Many thanks in advance. ",

You can order the probiotics online, not go to a store. I wouldn't be to concerned unless this doesn't go away in a few days. Stay hydrated and see how you do, if it becomes severe don't hesitate to go to ER. Try to cut back on your drinking and smoking. It will catch up with you, for every time you take a drink, drink water as well. Alcohol will def=hydrate you quicker . Try to drink something else instead, if you are an alcoholic, at least try to cut down till you feel better, once this is over try to seek help in stopping. As we age our bodies dont handle alcohol as well as when we were young. Hang in there, u can always get a phone appt with your doc too.",

This seemed to start with digestive issues. It seems to flair off and on. I've had several endoscopy and colonoscopies done and found nothing. They have said I have herniated discs. However, I seemed to have more episodes when my digestion is off track. From eating junk, alcohol, smoking, and not enough exercise. I do think stress plays a big roll as well. Make sure to stay hydrated ,eat smaller amounts, get your vitamin levels checked. Particularly vitamin D3, K2. C, B12. start by getting a good probiotic. Could be a bug or a type of IBS-IBD issues. Hope this helps. Take care!",

Low Vit D can cause stomach problems. These tests have to be specifically ordered by your doctor otherwise you will just have routine blood tests. You can ask to see your blood results under the 'Freedom Of Information Act' if your in UK ask your doctor for a print out and see if your vits and minerals were tested, in particular B12 and Vit D. Do you take multi vits and minerals? If your Vit 12 is low you will need to know because if very low you can get pernicious aneamia which can be dangerous.. You don't mention your age as Vit B12 gets lower as we age. Our vitamins and minerals are important for our wellbeing and energy particularly Vit D and B12 some medications prevent absorption of B12..hope this will be of some help....and yes i was in same boat as you some time ago until it was found my B12 was low also Vit D and magnesium.

Thanks!",

Endoscopy still waiting biopsy results but at initial tests looked fine. on and off i I have suffered very bad. My symptoms have varied so much over the time causing alot of confusion. A few of the doctors have said my swallowing problems are only in my head. I have a sore throat that never goes away. The swallowing has gotten somewhat better. I have pain under my ribcage. At time I cant digest even simplest of food. Since October 2019 I have been on bland soft diet strictly. i take digestive enzymes, also probiotics capsules, and eat probiotic yogerts. IHavevt eaten late since October 2019 ie allowing minimum of 3 hours before bed. I sleep on bed with raised bedhead. Still dont feel normal. For example yesterday i ate very bland broccoli and cabbage soup and it felt like sitting in my stomach for many hours, belching, slight burning, bloating very uncomfortable. Today the pain under left ribcage has come back again. My pancreatic function has been declared ok from blood test. Why cant i digest food as normal anymore. I don't drink and have never smoked in my life. Please share your experiences if similar to mine. Since this corona spread everything is on halt. I pray for everyone to stay safe. Oh forgot to say the breathing problems that really scare me.",

If symptoms do not go away within a few weeks or you think it's not helping then of course stop. Im not a doctor but I've healed my acid reflux in a couple of weeks with baking soda. Another problem it could be is low stomach acid. You could mix a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in water about 30 minutes before a meal to see if you digest properly. I wouldn't eat gassy foods. I'd stick to broth, potatoe, rice...super easy to digest foods...soluable fiber foods. Hang in there! hope this helps and try not to worry... it makes things so much worse. God be with you!",

Foods to avoid on a soft food diet Many foods should be avoided when following a soft food diet. Hard to digest foods, as well as those that are tough to chew, should be restricted. Typically, spicy and very acidic foods are also off-limits. The following foods are commonly restricted on soft diets (7, 8Trusted Source): Vegetables: raw vegetables, deep-fried vegetables, vegetables with seeds or rinds Fruits: fresh fruits (with some exceptions like avocados and bananas), fruits with peels and seeds, dried fruits, highly acidic fruits like lemons and limes Dairy products: hard cheeses, cheeses with nuts or dried fruit in them, yogurt with added ingredients, such as chocolate or nuts Grains and starches: hard crackers, chewy or crusty breads, high fiber breads and grains, such as seeded breads and shredded wheat, French fries, popcorn Meat, poultry, and fish: tough cuts of meat, fried fish or poultry, whole cuts of meat or poultry, high fat processed meats, such as bacon, shellfish, soups or stews with tough chunks of meat Fats: nuts, seeds, coconut flakes, crunchy nut butters Miscellaneous: seeded jams or jellies, chewy candies Spicy or irritating foods: hot peppers, tomato sauce, gas-promoting foods, such as cabbage and beans, tabasco sauce Beverages: alcohol, caffeinated beverages may be restricted as well depending on the condition being treated Note that your healthcare provider may recommend further restrictions depending on your medical condition. It\u2019s important to have a good understanding of the diet that\u2019s prescribed and your individual dietary needs. ..................... May I also suggest the Ensure Max protein drink, it is very healthy, taste is pretty good, diff flavors and adds alot of nutrition to your diet. Have you tried getting a second or even a third opinion form a diff Gastro. Have you had the gallbladder hida test done, also ask for further pancreas testing, did they use a camera ultra sound test on endoscope? MRI of internal organs. When you use anti acids like Rolaids, do they help at all?....and also describe your breathing issues in more detail.....try to relax, turn off the news, watch funny movies, and listen to relaxing music while doing other activities and at night use progressive relaxation to sleep. And do not accept any doctor telling you your symptoms are all in your head, this is un-acceptable and I would not go back to any doc that told me that. Also check into genetic testing for some abdominal issues as well. Most health facilities have genetic counselors you can consult with even over the phone now due to the virus. Good luck and am so sorry. I also deal with persistent issues. ",

I had an endoscopy of the stomach and the small intestine she was unable to find any abnormalities. She took sample tissues for biopsies but everything is on halt due to covid 19. As blood test and endoscopy has shown normal results my doctor has said a few times that it is in my head which really upsets me. I know when i feel normal and when I am suffering.",

        "post_content": "If anyone can shed some light on this I would be so grateful. About 7 months ago, during a period fairly heavy exercise at the gym (which may or may not even be relevant), I began to feel a crampy sensation just under my right ribs along with a sensation of weakness and tenseness across my abdomen. I didn't think much of it at first--in fact, I can't really even recall the exact day I began to have the problem--but when the symptoms didn't go away I saw my GP. He ordered all the standard tests. Blood work all came back normal. H. Pylori and mono negative. Two separate ultrasounds revealed a \"possible\" epigastric hernia and a slightly enlarged liver. Based on the liver finding we re-tested LFTs and they were normal (ALT and AST in the low 20s). We also tested for Hep B and C which came back negative. At this point I was referred to a surgeon for possible hernia surgery, but he wanted to rule out gallbladder motility problems so he ordered a HIDA scan first. My HIDA scan came back with an ejection fraction of 38%, which was the exact threshold for a \"normal\" functioning gallbladder. However, since I didn't have any of the other classic symptoms of gallbladder problems, we sort of moved past this as a possible explanation for my symptoms. I managed to convince my GP to refer me for an MRI, hoping it would confirm the hernia and give me the confidence I needed to proceed with hernia surgery. However, the MRI didn't show any epigastric hernia at ALL. It was otherwise completely normal. At this point I'm at a loss. I have no clear explanation for my symptoms, and they are showing no sign of getting better. The \"pain\" is fairly minimal. Occasional poking sensations just under my right ribs, along with some muscle cramping when I contract my oblique muscle. But it's the abdominal WEAKNESS and tenseness that is most bothersome. It's not even pain so much as pure discomfort. The discomfort seems to get worse when I use my core muscles. My rectus abdominis feels \"tight\" when I stretch on my hands and knees. Laying down makes it better. My leading theory at this point is the epigastric hernia, even though it wasn't seen on the MRI. I do also have a small bulge in my stomach when I raise my head from a laying down position which seems to confirm the epigastric hernia as well. But I struggle with the fact that an epigastric hernia doesn't really explain the RUQ pain. I also can't totally get past the slightly enlarged liver and borderline abnormal HIDA scan. Lastly, there are a couple other unexplained, small symptoms that I've been experiencing over the past few months which quite possibly relate to my issue. Lots of trapped air seems to \"gurgle\" up my esophagus. I have also always had occasional benign palpitations, but they have increased in frequency since this whole thing started. These symptoms in connection with everything else make me think of a possible hiatal hernia or ulcer. However, I don't really suffer from heartburn and at the very begining of this whole situation my GP prescribed a PPI, thinking possible GERD, and it did nothing (I understand this to be the frontline treatment for a HH). Anyway, if you've read through all this, thank you. If you have any ideas what my problem could be or you have experienced something similar, please let me know!",

She was newly qualified and young/ slightly nervous due to her inexperience. While doing the medication rounds one night she thinks she may have mixed up medication for two patients. One was am elderly woman approx 86 years of age who was admitted to hospital the next day and passed away a week later due to mensentric ischemia. She thinks the medication that she may have been missed blood pressure medication - more than likely. I am trying to reassure her that this was not her fault and just an unfortunate coinscience. Can I get an expert opinion on this? Any research I have done on line indicates that this could not be possible. This is something that has ate away at my girlfriend for the past few months and has really affected her mental health. Any help would be grately appreiated. Thanks.",

Be very gentle. Preparation H helps with hemorrhoids, they can be internal and external as well. Do you have alot of itching as well, if you do it may be a yeasty type infection that can be helped by using jock itch like medicated creams etc to kill of the excess yeast. This area is prone to sweat etc, wear lose fitting garments and at night wear cotton underwear so that area can breath. Taking internal probiotics may also help balance the ph of this area as well. Medications for jock itch like conditions may help you alot. Talk to the pharmacist for which ones are right for you. It seems like it is in a circular area which makes me think even more the jock itch type thing. an area where the skin touched alot and is prone to overheat and sweat. Good luck hope this helps. We all have a butt...lol...",

I had very bad tailbone and anal pain from 8 days in hospital. Been taking Miralax and Metamucil for bowel movements, but not much activity. Also taking walks each day. The main problem is that I cant sleep for any length of time. I figure for every hour in bed, I may get 15 minutes of sleep. But like clockwork, I wake up every hour with anal pressure and have to go through a bathroom routine of trying to poop and then heavy urination. Then back to bed and I wake up in an hour again. I've been given hydro cortisone cream for swelling/inflammation and temp relief of pressure and hemorrhoid. I tried Benadrihl per doctor but still woke up every hour just very groggy. Has anyone got suggestions on what to do? Doctor wont see me cause of Covid 19. Just says to give it time. I've lost 22 pounds and muscles are very weak. Forcing myself to eat but not having much bowel movements. The lack of sleep is messing with my mind and causing depression (4 weeks of this) Please help.",

It does take time after surgery for all the inflammation to go down, ask about taking ibuprofen to help with this as well, you might be able to talk to an advice nurse or a pharmacist as well on this issue, alot of inflammation can cause the bowels to back up and also the pressure you are talking about. If you are taking any kind of medication stay away from the Metamucil, only use miralax. Try taking larger does and it will soften the stool more and allow it to go through easier. Eat soft foods, and stay away from alot of fiber right now. this is not the time for fiber. That will be once you are all better, 4 weeks out from surgery is still not long for swelling. Again request a phone appt. Also there are also stool softeners that may help as well. When you were in hospital was the bed comfortable or did it add pressure to your tail bone, etc...I know there beds they have can be very uncomfortable and not have enough padding. For the sleeping, are you sleeping in a different position now due to the pain etc...we get used tot he same position and that can affect us. Try eating something heavy before bedtime like oatmeal that is more calming, noodles etc. it isn't unusual for something like surgery to throw off our clocks, if you cant sleep try reading, or listening to relaxing music, also doing progressive relaxation, and deep through the nose breathing. . Are you alone or do you share your house with anyone. Can they tell you if you stop breathing during your sleep. Sleeping on your side may be more comfortable. Turn off the news, and watch funny movies and relaxing shows. The phone appt if best as the doc can yell you if and when your symptoms may get better and what you can do to make the waiting more tolerable. Also wondering if you may also have a urine infection or kidney infection going on as well, is your urine clear and yellow...? Are you also taking any other kind of medications, Metamucil will absorb them and you may be reacting to them not getting into your system. Many people do not know this about Metamucil, it will absorb your medications and miralax is better if you take any kind of medications. Get that phone appt...good luck and heal fast !",

No issues with constipation or diarrhea currently. It seems worse after eating and sometimes just from drinking water. But for the most part just intense bloating throughout the day. I've never had a flare up of this kind last this long and was wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation and what they did.",

Went to my doctor, they did blood work, came to find out my pancreatic levels were very elevated (pancreatitis). I'm not a heavy drinker, but I assumed that after coming home from vacation, maybe I just overdid it. They did an ultrasound, an MRI, and a colonscopy/endscopy. Everything came back normal. And my pancreatic levels did lower. Fast forward to now. Still having that pressure sensation. Still feel some cramping on either side of my abdomen, as in where my liver/pancreas is. Some upper back pain/disconfort, but I have some back issues, so I'm not sure if that's gastro or not. The MRI did show some fat on my liver, but nothing serious, according to the gastro specialist. Sometimes my stool has been pale, but not consistently. No jaundice, dark stool, etc. I was giving a prescription for IBS, and that was about it. I'm wondering what other things I should be doing, or any other diagnostic tests I should be asking for.",

I would think that in a case like this there would be a standing order to test the enzymes whenever you felt there may be a problem, you go to the lab and do the test to see where they are at. Maybe a revisit to the doc again to push the envelope into seeing if anything further is going on and also if not satisfied try another gastro. A second opinion. ",

I have no family who are able to help and most of my neighbours are elderly. On the government website it said that if you were vulnerable you would receive a letter stating so and you would be able to get a slot with one of the supermarkets to do online shopping As it is now they're not even taking on any new registrations for online shopping.

        "post_content": "I'm getting some weird abdominal pains on my right side. It started a couple of months ago with discomfort when bending forwards, and has gradually been getting worse. First it was just bending over, then it spread to when I was sitting, so I had to kind of slouch, but now I'm getting it while slouching and about the only position I don't get it is standing up or lying flat. The area is on the right hand side just under the the ribs. The pain is like a dull pain or pressure - feels like something it pressing on something inside me, but also when bending forward I can also get a weird tingly pain which feels like it's on top of my ribs, and this stretches from the front all the way around my side. I also have a near constant dull pain in my back in around the same area. I realise there's a big mess of organs in that area, so I've been reading up on the symptoms of the likely suspects. The problem is, I don't really have any other symptoms which seem to go with any of the main problems. It's not a sharp or stabbing or severe pain, and I don't have any fever, nausia, weight loss, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, loss of appettite, weakness, swelling, shortness of breath, high or low blood pressure or chest pains. I'm otherwise fairly fit and healthy, though I could do with losing a few kilos (5'11, 80kg, 20% body fat). I recently (while I had this problem) had a \"wellman check\" which included a wide range of blood tests. All were within normal ranges, including kiney and liver function tests. GP has recomended an ultrasound, but said this could be 3-4 weeks... Any thoughts on what it might be?",

Or could be enalrged liver..either way the ultrasound will show that.. although it doesnt always pick up gallstones..a CT with contrast would be a better imaging study. You should have your ALT/AST. blood panel checked and your bilirubin, amaylse and liapse (for pancreas) (although that would be more acute pain in most cases). Hnestly doesnt sound that complicated but if the issue is acure gallbladder there is little they can really do but remove it. However the best approach to that would be laproscopic (small incision) removla if at all possible..the other way..is a horror (open laparatomy)..Anyway.ger the ultrasound first.;.and then if anything is 'suspected' you need to ask for a CT with contrast.",

Its mostly a dull ache. It seems worse at night, especially if I lie on my left side. My appetite has completely abandoned me, and I never feel hungry. sometimes it radiates across my back, or over to my right rib (but on a lesser pan scale) My bowel movements seem loose, but then again, have been mostly like that all year, I even had a colonoscopy to investigate, but it came back clear. I feel like I am urinating less often too, but its light or clear. I have an urgent referral to the gastroentorolgist on Monday, but I am not really coping with the waiting, when I mentioned my pan can frar to my GP, he said \"its on the list, but not top of the list\". I didn't ask what was at the top of the list, was too busy freaking out. I know what will be, will bem but I just can't get a grip on this :-( Has anyone else had these symptoms? Thanks ",

I am trying to cling on to the thought that a week before i had these pains, i had a raft of blood tests ( fbc, esr, liver, kidney function, bilirubin, creatine) and tgey came back normal. no specific cancer marker tests though). monday seems an age away \u2639\ufe0f thank you again Jules",

So, to prove to myself I ate some oven baked battered fish with oven chips, two chocolate biscuits, and then rather stupidly a small piece of cheese just before bed. No Valium Well, I didn't sleep at all, the pain was (and still is), quite bad. Now I don't know whether it was the food, or the fact that the Valium was helping me sleep through any pain :-( ",

The next test is an endoscopy, so of course I am really scared that it will be a stomach tumour (don't you just love health anxiety). It is like torture having to wait another week for this test, and being in near constant pain is really making me feel low. I think I may be slipping into depression. Tying to stay positive, I had an endoscopy about 18 months ago, and apart from a little gastritis type erosions, it was all clear, and stomach cancers are apparently slow growing; my consultant told me that stomach cancer is \"vanishingly rare, and on the decrease\"; the pain no longer wakes me up at night, and my appetite, although still not what it was, has improved a bit. I did also have a lot of blood tests about a week before this pain started, and they were all normal. Still, 5 weeks seems like a lifetime to be having this pain daily Jules x ",

        "post_content": "hello, mega worried currently had fatty stools for a while now, the colour is normal and sometimes my stools are ok, but most of the time they float, theres an oil slick on the top of the water and they smell very bad. had blood tests, full blood count, liver and kidney function all good, im not anemic, i dont have celiac disease. im not losing weigh, i dont feel any stomach pain, only after eating spicy food the next day. but my amylase level is slightly raised, the first test was 116 and the second test was 113, the normal range for my tests end at 110 so im currently boarderline so i need another amylase test. my GP has refered me to a gastroenterologist on a non urgent appointment, which is in july. obviously the suspect is something pancreas related and im terrified its something like cancer. also as far as i know im not diabetic. just really want to know why my body is havig trouble with fats? also my bowels are fine and stool samples didnt know any bowel imflammation. has anyone ever had similar symptoms? thank you.",

Had numerous blood tests which for the most part were normal (high iron and LFT) but have been normal the last 2 times i got bloods done. I have had a elastace stool test to check for pancreatic issues which was normal and a CT and Ultra sound scan. Been through a colonoscopy and Gastrocopy which showed nothing either. I done some other liver tests especially bilirubin ones as im worried about pancreatic cancer due to my steatorreha and urine color but those are in the normal range. This has been going on since May last year and im no further forward ",

        "post_content": "Hi there, hoping someone might be able to share any similar experiences based on the current range of symptoms I have. 10 days ago, I started with a pain in the lower right quadrant area which felt like a pulled muscle or a strain, but was around the area where appendix pain would present. The pain was noticeable but not unbearable and lingered for 3 or 4 days. During this time I suffered with some nausea and mild sweats/fatigue. I went to the GP on day 7 who ran a number of in situ checks, which were as follows: - Temperature - Normal range - Blood pressure - Normal range - Urine sample (dip test) - Normal - No pain on touching LRQ area - No rebound pain upon releasing pressure. As mentioned, it has now been 10 days since first presentation of this. The pain is noticeable but bearable. Bowel and bladder activity is unremarkable, though I have noticed an increased amount of stomach gurgling and gas. The pain does come and go and is worse upon getting up from a lying position and also, I foolishly attempted the plank on Joe Wicks' P.E. session this Morning ,(the Lockdown Legacy) and that made the pain worse. if anyone has had similar experiences, please let me know. I appreciate that this is no substitute for further visits to a GP, but in these difficult times, I am trying to stay away from public places wherever possible. Thanks for reading. James.",

        "post_content": "I'll try to be as brief as possible here. For 5 months now I've been feeling a dull rectal pain/pressure, change in bowel habits, some diarrhea on and off, and perianal itching. Initially I thought I had CPPS or chronic pelvic pain because I'm only 30. I'm generally healthy, a healthy weight at least. My diet has been bad for years but I have a fast metabolism that keeps me lean. My urologist ordered an Abdominal/Pelvic Ct with contrast to rule out sinister pathology and everything was clear besides \"Mild Diffuse Rectal wall thickening, and mild proximal sigmoid colon thickening with minimal fat standing.\" My initial gastro did a colonoscopy and only found 1 flat rectal polyp. I felt as though my care was insufficient and seeked a 2nd opinion. My second opinion Gastro told me not to worry about the wall thickening because \"there wasnt distension in the colon, so it can appear as thickening on ct but it is only because the colon isnt properly distended.\" He wanted to check for anal cancer and did a High Resolution Anoscopy and found no lesions, but did a repeat colonoscopy as well and found an addition 4 polyps that the other doctor missed which I'm still waiting to hear back about, although he didnt seem worried about Cancer. Ontop of this my ct scan showed small subsegmental pulmonary embolism in my lower lung that required a brief hospital stay, which has further fueled my worry about a malignancy because hidden cancers can cause as many as 10% of unprovoked blood clots. The internet is filled with scary information about colon/rectal wall thickening and for some reason I still maintain stress and worry that I could have a colon cancer that is in the Wall of my colon but hasn't grow outward but just grown into the wall, since the first surgeon missed 4 polyps as it is. I probably shouldnt be stressing about all this, but I needed to get some stuff off my chest It would be incredibly rare for 2 colonoscopies to miss a colo/rectal cancer right? All my bloodwork is normal, I have no blood in stool or on toilet paper. Thanks for any thoughts and thanks for reading.",

Past few weeks i have developed worsening pain in my left upper quadrant front and sometimes migrating to back. A few days ago i noticed a hard mass to the left of my belly button and above. It has grown increasingly more painful , especially to touch . Very sore and sensitive! Pain is worse after eating(along with nausea) and when laying down and even when i move i can feel this \"mass\" move as if its in the way! Any ideas what it could be ? I don't think it is due to my constipation as the rest of my lower abdomen is soft and i am still having bowel movements. Could it be my pancreas or hernia ? I'm very scared and uncomfortable constantly as I can feel it all the time now and my abdomen is so sensitive to touch. ",

        "post_content": "Hi all, I'm 20 and I have had on and off digestive issues for years but about 3-4 months ago, I started having severe bouts of reflux and indigestion including belching, bloating, lump in throat, shortness of breath, chronic cough, abdominal pain but it used to come and go so I didn't pay much attention to it at the time. Until about 2 months ago when I had to go to the ER with really bad stomach pain and shortness of breath. They told me I had GERD and prescribed pantoprazole for 30 days. The next day, I had a terribly sore throat, stiff neck and difficulty/pain swallowing along with all the other symptoms - tried to swallow pills and had horrible shooting pain in upper back and arm. Saw my GP too and she told me to continue taking the ppi but it seemed to make all of my symptoms worse and then i started experiencing muscle spasms, pain/tingling in legs, arms and back, chest pain, heartburn (never had it before), tinnitus, facial stiffness two weeks into the med - thought I was having a heart attack. So my gp switched it to Prevacid instead and ordered a blood test, barium swallow test and thyroid and abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasounds came back normal and the blood test came back negative for h.pylori and was fine overall except my vitamin D is low so I've been taking pills for that. The barium swallow showed a small esophageal stricture in the neck region and moderate acid reflux so doctor referred me for an endoscopy. But I haven't been able to get that done yet because of the covid-19 situation and I'm also terrified of the procedure so I don't know how i'll be able to go through with it. I am just really worried because I don't know what could cause the stricture even though my gp doesn't think that's really causing my symptoms. So, I've been on Prevacid for about a month now but I haven't seen much improvement in my symptoms. My throat feels less sore and its easier to swallow but I still have cough intermittently and I can't seem to take a 'big' swallow or gulp. My jaw feels tender and my neck has been constantly stiff and hurts at certain points when I swallow too so I don't know if that's related. I have been constantly bloated and my abdomen feels very tight for over 2 months now and I feel like I can't take a deep breath at all, especially when eating or walking. I constantly feel the need to belch or burp and I haven't eaten properly since I've started the ppi's - I've mostly been on a soft food diet and have avoided all trigger foods. About 2 weeks ago, I also noticed a white coating on my tongue and burning sensation in my mouth which hasn't gone away so I've been taking nystatin for oral thrush since past 3 days but haven't seen improvement yet. I have random burning/pain sensations radiating to my abdomen and upper and lower back usually in between meals or while eating and especially at night. I also feel really cold sometimes and get chills down my back and chest. I am just really miserable and don't know what's going on. I am worried it might be something serious and I have no way to get a proper diagnosis soon because of the current pandemic situation which is making my anxiety go through the roof. ",

They just take a tube down your throat and look and take biopsies which are very small and don't bother you. Don't fear this test. An esophageal stricture refers to the abnormal narrowing of the esophageal lumen; it often presents as dysphagia commonly described by patients as difficulty swallowing. People with a benign esophageal stricture may experience the following symptoms: swallowing becoming difficult or painful. food feeling stuck in the throat. food returning up to the mouth from the stomach. Esophageal stricture can be caused by: Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Eosinophilic esophagitis. Injuries caused by an endoscope. Long-term use of a nasogastric (NG) tube (tube through the nose into the stomach). Swallowing substances that harm the lining of the esophagus. ... Treatment of esEpidemiology. Esophageal stricture formation is not common. There is an overall low disease prevalence for the condition. ... Strictures due to caustic esophagitis or eosinophilic esophagitis, however, are more common in children and young patients esophageal varices. Soft diet tips Take small bites of food and chew foods well. Avoid tough meats, fresh \u201cdoughy\u201d bread or rolls, hard bread crust, and abrasive foods. Sip fluids when taking solids at meals and snacks to moisten foods. Stop eating when you start to feel full. Eat slowly in a relaxed atmosphere. How do you treat esophageal stricture naturally? (Only until you get treatment for it.) Avoid foods that may increase reflux. ... Use good pill-taking habits. ... Lose weight. ... If you smoke, quit. ... Avoid certain medications. ... Avoid stooping or bending, especially soon after eating. Avoid lying down after eating. ... Raise the head of your bed. **************** After reading all of this info, I think until you can get the test done, eat the soft foods, small bites, take your time eating, Drink Max protein ensure if you feel you are not getting enough nutrients. It has a not so bad taste and makes you get all you need. You can drink it 3 times a day if you want. Talk to your doctor by phone, set up a phone appt or a telemed appt to talk to them more. Also at this pint I would suggest you be seen by a Gastro specialist and not the GP. Until you can get the endoscope and see what is going on do things that are relaxing, and try to keep your mind off of it. Watch funny movies, turn off the news, we know what is going on and what to do to stay safe, or just watch it once a day. Use progressive relaxation, which you can find on the internet, there are cds and music for it. With your vit D being low, when you can you should also check your blood calcium level and PTH level as well. They make chewable Vit . d and liquid D too. Stay away from breads, meats or other dense foods, if you do eat them, eat very small pieces, make sure that is all the way down before taking another bite, but soft foods are your best choice. Veggies are soft when cooked, fruits, apple sauce etc. Eat slowly. Eat in a relaxed environment. And above all relax. ",

While the intensity subsided, I have been somewhat bloated and constipated ever since. I went to see a GI, who took a scan of me. They found nothing wrong - just an abnormally large amount of stool backed up in my system. The doctor gave me some probiotics which did not help. The doctor was very lackadaisical about the whole thing. He suggested that it might be IBS. I asked him if, in that case, it would be a lifelong condition, and he dismissively said that in males of my age, IBS is usually self limiting and will go away Since then, I've been struggling with this gassy feeling. A few months ago, I began farting & burping abnormally to make matters worse. Does anyone know of a way to reduce this gas?",

It is really weird but others have tried it and it does the same thing. It seems like this is the only thing that works for me. There are also charcoal capsules you can take and many find good relief with these, just make sure that if you are taking any kind of medication you talk to the pharmacist about how to space it apart as the charcoal absorbs the gas as well as the medications. The charcoal capsules will also reduce the smell of the gas. ",

I have stuck to a plain diet and am only really eating plain rice, homemade veg soup and plain omelette but it doesn&#39;t feel like I am getting any better.</p><p></p><p>My my main symptom is that I feel incredibly full after eating the tiniest amount such as half a banana. I have tried to eat little and often but I feel like the food just sits in my stomach and makes me feel sick. I have now lost 1 stone in 2 weeks and the weight is continuing to drop off me but I can&#39;t eat enough to sustain my weight. I&#39;ve gone from being fit and active to being signed off work and unable to do anything.</p><p></p><p>Blood tests all came back normal so I&#39;m being referred to a specialist, however in the meantime I feel like my whole life is on hold.</p><p></p><p>Has anyone else been unable to eat with gastritis?

If I eat too much, even if it&#39;s a normal or even a small sized portion for other people, I get this awful flare up and I feel even sicker and more nauseous than I initially was, and it&#39;ll last an hour or more in bad days until the food passes into the other parts of my intestine. </p><p></p><p>I honestly don&#39;t know what you have because abdominal and stomach symptoms are so broad that it can be anything.

I was belching a lot and my abdomen was very distended. &#160;I had a full CBC bloodwork done, along with stool tests. Everything came back normal. &#160;The doc put me on Prilosec (same as you), this helped with the belching. &#160;But I still couldn&#39;t eat anything but chicken noodle soup and crackers. &#160;I did get to the point where I was able to eat a very small amount of fruit. &#160;Still not knowing what was causing all this, the doc put me on two different strong antibiotics. &#160;My doc consulted with other doctors and they feel I may have a bacterial infection in my gut. &#160;This cocktail of medications will kill any bacteria that might be in me. &#160;I was also told to start a Probiotic, especially with the antibiotics, because unfortunately these not only kill the bad bacteria they also kill the good. &#160;So the Probiotics will replace the good bacteria that gets killed while I am on these antibiotics. &#160;Keep in mind that due to your weight loss your stomach has shrunk and cannot handle much food. &#160;I&#39;m having the same problem. &#160;I&#39;ve also read that once you have any kind of abdominal sickness, it takes a long time for the stomach and intestines to heal. &#160;I hope you&#39;re able to find out what the problem is soon, I have sympathy for you, knowing how you are feeling.</p>",

I have been having the most awful 7 weeks, it&#160; started where i felt sick every morning, then i felt sick most of the time, the thought of food was turning my stomach, i went to the doctor, they done blood tests all came back normal bar one which came up saying i had H pylori, I was given 2 lots of antibiotics for&#160;7 days&#160;as well as&#160;&#160;lansoprazole?, i did start feeling a little better whislt taking them but still felt as though something was stuck in my throat, i took them all and was told to double dose on the lansoprazole while&#160;on antibiotics,&#160;which i did,its been about 3 weeks since antibiotics and&#160;its been over a week that i stopped the lansops.&#160;&#160;Soon as i stopped i started to get the heartburn back and diarreha, burping and backache, I&#39;m also feeling sick but not actually being sick,&#160;I feel as though i am forcing myself to eat as i haven&#39;t got much of an appetite, though i am not sick after eating&#160;but i&#160;get full quick! I went back to the doctor on wednesday, thinking he may give me more lansops or something similar, instead he is sending me for an endoscopy but that could take weeks.&#160; I&#39;m just wondering if the antibiotics didn&#39;t work or the HP has returned as this morning I brought a small bit of yellow bile.&#160; Did you have any more problems after the antibiotics?&#160; You have put that it takes a long time for the stomach and intestines to heal? I wonder if mine have not healed as yet. I also suffer from IBS other than that i am normally healthy person.</p><p></p><p>?Sorry for rambling just after some advice.</p>",

I was really surprised that they called so fast! &#160;But I think my PCP probably told them it was urgent for me to be seen, and it is. &#160;This has been going on for three weeks now.</p><p></p><p>It could be possible that your H-pylori has not gone away yet, has your doctor said he was going to do another stool test on you? &#160;I would think he/she would to see if you still test positive for it. &#160;How else would you know if it&#39;s gone? &#160;I&#39;m so sorry for your suffering, it&#39;s nice to know at least that we&#39;re in this together. &#160;Please let me know how you&#39;re doing.</p>",

        "post_content": "<p>Hello everyone,</p><p></p><p>For the past month or so I began experiencing really bad what felt like hunger pains. I would wake up in the morning and hit the exercise bike to reduce my stress for the day. Halfway through my routine I began getting really hungry. I didn&#39;t think much of it because I was use to going hours without food and being fine. Only an hour or two later I began having such bad hunger pains I thought that I was going to pass out. I ate something small and it all went away. Ever since that incident I would have hunger pains, gurgling, and belching every 2 hours of every day it seemed. No matter how much I ate it would return. I went to the docs and they ran a full panel of bloods. Tests came back normal ( diabetes, thyroid, liver, kidneys, heart and so on). My doctor said that I am healthy from what he can see. He told me I most likely have gastritis or a hernia. If I snack all day long it stays maintained but it won&#39;t go away. He prescribed 2 zantacs a day for two weeks with no spicy food. I do not drink alcohol but I do smoke. I stopped all coffee as well. I drink a lot of tea now. I do not have the common symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, or stabbing pains but I do have really bad hunger like pains at times. Does this sound like gastritis to anyone or does or has anyone had the same symptoms? If so what worked for you? I will be starting the Zantac today even though I hate medicine lol </p>",

I drink more water and Gatorade as well to stay hydrated. </p><p></p><p>Even now when I exercise I will feel amazing all day long except my stomach tends to gurgle a bit more. If I snack all day long I will be ok. I was waking up in the middle of the night with bad hunger pains but that has gone. Also note that I was diagnosed with espophagal reflux a few years ago. I never took anything for it and didn&#39;t have any serious issues. I am mildly lactose intolerant but I know what to stay away from. I should also add that lately with these hunger pains I will also feel nauseous or a bit lightheaded as if my blood sugar is low. My hands tend to tremor some and I may begin a little bit of sweating. Has any of these issues happened to you? I know that I have been stressed out but as of lately my anxiety has lessened but I&#39;ll still get this stuff. Doctor said that my stress, smoking, caffeine intake, and spicy foods are irritating it. Like I said though I cut out coffee, spicy foods and I try to exercise a bit but that irritates my issue also. </p>",

Total greek yoghurt is good for calcium, as is cheese if you struggle with normal dairy (it doesn&#39;t have a lot of lactose in it).</p><p></p><p>Regarding the stomach acid, I was permanently belching, feeling bloated despite not having an appetite, and I was put on omeprazole for about 9 months but it didn&#39;t really solve anything. I did my own research and am using natural methods, which work for me. I think that you have already found that eating a little something makes the hunger type pangs go away, perhaps this is a way to go for you, eating little and often?</p>",

I desperately wanted to stop after smoking for too many years. (Alan Carr&#39;s Easiway book by the way and I quit cold turkey <img src=\"http://s8.patient.media/forums/emoticons/wink.gif\" alt=\"wink\" /> )&#160;</p><p></p><p>I always thought that my heartburn and belching were down to acid reflux but actually after reading up I don&#39;t think I have enough acid. We all need acid to digest our food, so turning it off or neutralising it doesn&#39;t make much sense to me! &#160;Have a read up on &quot;low stomach acid&quot;. What works for me is digestive bitters before a main meal and I couple that with a really decent probiotic with a multiple strains of the good bacteria. SIBO. The probiotic yogurt will help but the doses aren&#39;t as high as with a supplement.</p><p></p><p>I would say though that my tum gets really irritated by not eating enough. I know if I go too long between meals and then say have a tea or coffee then the gurgling and tummy rumbling starts. Definitely stay away from smoking in place of meals or have a little snack with a ciggie.</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps, I feel ya!!</p>",

I have terrible circulation....could be another reason..just guessing. So she could try drinking more water and garlic pills can help with circulation if she has any problems with that. If shes old enough she could be going through menopause ..could be another culprit. ",

She urinated probably every few minutes for 6 months and it was life altering. So I've been there and it's very stressful. We went to urologist too and everything came out fine. Id rule out everything it could be but if they cant find anything then it could just be inflammation. We bought fish oils for her thinking it may be the inflammation from her bowels pressing on her bladder and we were right ...the peeing stopped in about a week. Fish oils are really good for inflammation. She also has IBS and is very hyper too. Hope this helps him. ",

They are normal. The Liver is within normal echogenicity means the Liver fat is in normal limits. The Spleen volume is also within the normal range and the size of the bile duct is also normal. The aorta and vena cava are patent means the blood flow is normal. So means there's not any current abnormal finding. Other than that the bowel content part and gall bladder part is not understandable by me. And please i will say again I'm not a radiologist so i can't surely say whatever i told is correct but atleast it is assuring as per what's written online. So see your physician and he will tell what's correct and what's not. Best Wishes and take care. Do tell me what your gp tells you as i am also going to have an abdominal ultrasound next month. Have a nice day!",

When you talk with your doc ask if that was the case . If this is the case, or even if it isn.t, it may be good to do a full ct scan using contrast to have a better look inside. Doing a gall bladder test is pretty easy as well, it is called a hida test and can be done as an outpatient. Even though the pain is on the right, still worth looking into. Even if the gall bladder looks ok on the scan it can still be under functioning. An endoscope, colonoscopy depending on what the doc thinks and your pain. Same questions, have you changed your diet recently, had any injuries, what kind of pain, constant, throbbing,.....is it still there. How long has it been going on....good luck.",

        "post_content": "ive never had serious health issues, im 20, and try to be as healthy as i can. but this has been going on for now around 7-8 months ans i dont know what else to do anymore. around september of 2020, i moved into a new apartment. a few weeks later, i started developing loose stool, abdominal cramps, gas, rumbling stomach, and general pain. As 20 year olds do, i ignored the problem for months until it completely altered my quality of life. the same symptoms with no consistent bowel movement or color over months. i assumed it was a food intolerance!! so i kept a food diary, and started cutting out common allergens/intolerances. I have experimented with cutting out soy, FODMAPS, eggs, gluten, dairy. all seem to help for a week or so then back to old symptoms. so no help there- still not eating eggs or dairy. i went to a GI doctor - after a thyroid function blood test, test for celiac, stool sample test for all sorts of things - everything came back normal??? so i went to my local clinic, got an std test and general bloodwork to rule out all options. once again, negative and normal. so on paper i look perfectly healthy. at this point doctors are no help. I assume it is ibs or stress related. so i take probiotics, prebiotics, and start meditating to calm anxiety. no help. i take digestive enzymes. no help. please, someone - if you have ANY CLUE as to what the hell is going on, please help me out here. I'm honestly begging, i just want this to be over, or some way to control it. if i have to eat spinach only for the rest of my life, so be it, i just need something.",

If it is IBS then phyllium husk (metamucil) can help slow down your colon. Also try some Imodium for diarrhea...that can help too. Pay attention to see if sugar makes things hurt worse. Sugar inflames your body so may need to lay off it for a while. Look at eating soluble fiber foods quick cooking oat meal, white rice, white bread, white potatoes stuff like that because it's easy to digest. Insoluable foods has too much fiber and will make you poo more. Hope this helps you. Hang in there.

Is it possible your are allergic to anything in your apartment like rugs etc, some of them can be treated with formaldehyde and this can bother some folks, also ask about pesticide spraying in your apartment and your building. Be away from the building when they spray for several hours, and ask them not to spray your apartment . Talk to an allergist about anything that may be an allergen to you in your new surroundings. Also do a heavy metal testing as we never know what may or may not be in our new environments. Did you have a ct scan done with contrast as well, and an endoscope and also test for h. pylori. Just some additional ideas. Have you changed your diet in anyway, eaten at different places. Do you drink alcohol/recreational drugs and if you do , do you notice symptoms worsen after. You don't need to answer this on here, just think about it. If all else fails try some genetic testing through a genetic testing/consult with a genetic counselor . Are you under stress, or anxiety when this started. Did you get your gallbladder tested with the hida test, I assume you had a full cbc blood work up done. Do you have any pets.... Are there any other symptoms that you notice along with this....I also suggest a second opinion , like trying another doctor. Another Gastro, and the allergist as well. ..I hope u can find your reason. Good luck. :) I am not sure why my response was deleted, so I will leave it at that. ",

        "post_content": "I'm a 42 year old male. No history of any medical problems. Sunday morning ( 9'th ) last month, I started experiencing an upset stomach. I had no symptoms the previous day. I had no change to my normal diet which is usually just normal home cooked foods. It basically felt like an upset stomach sensation... maybe some inflamed feeling.. A few days after I took some anti acid pills.. which seemed to improve the discomfort level.. It usually gets a little worse after eating a meal. I would describe it as feeling a bit \"bloated\" or full after eating and some discomfort. I also can taste a metallic taste in my mouth usually always in the morning after waking, and sometimes can see some rust color reddish blood in my saliva if I spit... I once belched and noticed it as well.... sometimes its just a yellowish type color... I did also experience 1 bout of heartburn at one point. -My appetite is ok now. Not 100% perfect but better than it was previously.. There were a few days when my appetite was bad.. then it improved... - I have no Diarrhea. Stool looks normal color. - No fever - No vomiting - No hard pains in stomach - blood pressure normal I went to a walk in clinic and the Dr there said it was GERD... Then I went to a Gastroenterologist a few days ago and he sent me to get bloodwork (tomorrow) and a CT Scan with IV contrast on Monday... anyone have similar symptoms or have more info about this ????",

I told on the other forum it could be bile acids that go through your tissues that causes the itchiness due to your slight fatty liver. It's more detrimental if the itchiness will disappear because it can be a sign of liver failure . So **STOP drinking alcohol and stop eating fatty foods including fried foods,** I am sure your itchiness will disappear in a healthy way. Eat healthy, more raw food instead of cooked food. Also, a fatty liver is not detrimental thing, but if you will continue drinking alcohol and eat more fried foods without control, it could progress to liver cirrhosis and this is a deadly thing. A slight fatty liver is a manageable health problem. ",

This doc doesn't see respiratory patients so not as risky, when you go you can wear latex gloves if this makes you feel more protested from the virus, stay as far away from people as you can, wear a face mask, wash your hands often if not wearing gloves. use sanitized provided in their office. Don't get up close to anyone's face. Before leaving the building use wash your hands, use a paper towel to open doors then toss it. So if this is bothering you alot, go in anyway. Just use common sense while around others. Watch your diet till you can get in to see doc. They may be able to order the ct over the phone if you call them. Actually a good blood work up may be all you need to check your enzymes level. Do you have dry skin, have you tried lotions, winter can make skin dry and itchy, have you changed your laundry detergent...changed your diet, is it still happening now or did it stop. Good luck !!",

        "post_content": "<p>6 weeks ago I got sick with this. I can eat a grain of rice and I&#39;ll feel bloated as if I just ate a Christmas dinner. I get bad nausea on the bad days. I have this huge fear of throwing up so anxiety plays a big part too. Some days it&#39;s so bad I can&#39;t even bring myself to swallow my own saliva. I have lost 15 pounds and I&#39;m already really skinny as it is. Lying down makes it worse, so sleeping is hard. &#160;It is not uncommon for me to wake up in the middle of the night with tremors lasting up to an hour. What am I supposed to do if I can barely eat or sleep?&#160; I have not had any bowel anormalities and haven&#39;t thrown up. I suspect I&#39;d throw up if I forcefed myself more.&#160;</p><p></p><p>It&#39;s really frustrating because I&#39;ve been to 3 doctors with no avail. They all say everyting looks fine. I feel like they think I&#39;m overreacting when I&#39;m not. I need help but doctors just don&#39;t seem to care since it&#39;s not life threatening in their eyes. I&#39;m in so much discomfort and don&#39;t know what to do. I want to get a new doctor but will have to wait for the weekday to find one and schedule a consultation which may take another week. It&#39;s extremely distressing</p><p></p><p>These are the things I&#39;ve tried:</p><p></p><p>Endoscopy: gluten intolerance, h pylori test, top of small bowel culture</p><p></p><p>Acid Reflux Medication (omeprazole, zantac, Pepcid, gi cocktail)</p><p></p><p>Peptobismo</p><p></p><p>Cipro (7 days, twice a day)</p><p></p><p>Zofran</p><p></p><p>Ct scan w/o contrast (intestinal inflammation was found, everyting else looked fine)</p><p></p><p>Probiotics </p><p></p><p>Paleo Diet</p><p></p><p>All liquid diet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Nothing seems to help except an all liquid diet which isn&#39;t really sustainable. I struggle to get 500 calories a day. I don&#39;t know what to do at this point. I want my life back.</p>",

There are meds you can buy over the counter that can help e.g colpermin and windeze or similar for gas. Stay away from food you know can cause probs for you personally. It really is a good idea to keep a food diary even mentally. You could ask your GP for medication to calm your anxiety. Stress breeds stress.. good luck and don&#39;t panic! it will all be ok just tell yourself that when you feel anxious. take regular sips of water during the day with a squeeze of lemon (if you can).</p>",

Doctors prepared for an ERCP to remove the gallstone, but decided to do an MRI first. The MRI did not indicate presence of gallstone anymore, doctors said it may have cleared on it's own, so no ERCP was done. * Has slight elevated temperature between 99 - 100.6 degrees F. * MRI also did not indicate any necrosis. * Had massive abdominal pain at time of admission - doctors put on on strong opiod painkillers every 2 hours for first day after admission. After first day, they started reducing the dosage to half of what was originally administered, and are administering it after 4 hours. It has been 6 days now, and her pain is still coming back every 3-4 hours. After 4.5 hours she starts screaming out of pain. Has anyone had a similar experience with pancreatitis? What is the typical recovery and healing timeline for this situation. Also, is it worrisome that the pain has not really subsided after 6 days? Could you please share your thoughts. ",

After trying everything I knew it was not my usual gallbladder attacks that i had been suffering with since 2013. anyway, they started me on dilaudid and it barely took the edge off of that horrible pain. they kept me on nothing by mouth(including fluids) until my last day in there when my Lipase finally went back down to almost normal. to try and summarize, i was referred to the same surgeon three years in a row by my GI specialist, but he denied my gallbladder surgery every time just saying that he could not guarantee that my pain would stop. by january of 2019, my GI was puzzled at why i was still having gallbladder attacks since he had already referred me ti have it removed. he was livid when he found out the surgeon had never done it! so he sent me to a different doc and by the end of that month my gallstone infested gallbladder was OUT! i had instant relief and i have been pain free gor well over a year now! i did ask my surgeon IF i had any gallstones and he said OH YES. i then asked how many and he said ONE IS TOO MANY, but mine was full of both the green kind and the black kind. needless to say i am happy now but furious that i had to suffer unnecessarily all of those years. then both docs told me that once you have had pancreatitis, you automatically meet surgical criteria. i hope your wife is doing better now but dont hesitate to ask me anything anytime.

She def needs to be at the specialist office and needs some answers. If her pain continues and she doesn't have any more pain meds she needs to go back to the ER , and also a follow up with a very good specialist. Is she still in the hospital ? and if so why are they not doing more to find out the cause of the attack. If she is at home I would take her back to the ER. And demand answers, The ER is not a nice place any more and all they do is get you out the door as soon as they can. It is very sad. So you have to be demanding and ask for results. Not mean, just not ok with no answers. If she is at home try to make sure she remains hydrated and if she cant eat try to get the Max protein ensure in her if doc oks it. It can take some time for the pancreas to simmer down, but you also need answers and they should be telling you how long and why. THe temp may indicate an infection in the pancreas or other organ such as gall bladder. (****************** Pancreatitis may start suddenly and last for days, or it can occur over many years. It has many causes, including gallstones and chronic, heavy alcohol use. Symptoms include upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment usually requires hospitalization. Once they stabilize the patient, doctors treat the underlying cause.",

I believe the doctors ticked all the boxes to diagnose the condition (monitoring lipase, WBC etc., CT Scan, MRI) etc. They did a stool sample and said there is no infection. Her fever is also 99.5-100.5 so not shooting up too much. They also confirmed that they did not see any necrosis or other complications in the MRI. At this point, the only thing I'm wondering is - does it take this long (>8 days) to heal? Sam.",

Don't skip meals, and try to eat at about the same time each day to help regulate bowel function. Exercise regularly. Do you have some belly cramps? Whats your age by the way.

        "post_content": "I have been experiencing this for the last few months, I have been searching the web looking for answers. I am a 45 year old female, in good health, I take no medications, thin, active, I eat healthy, so I am at a loss. I have this feeling like there is something under my right rib cage as if something is stuck underneath or enlarged. At first I thought I had strained a muscle b/c I had been working out in the yard the day before it started. It doesn't hurt, it just feels like there is something there that shouldn't be but when I touch the area there is no swelling or bulge. After about 3-4 weeks when it wasn't going away I went to see my doctor. They did blood work, urine labs and sent me for an ultrasound of gallbladder, all came back normal. I have no other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc. just this feeling like something is there. It seemed to go away on it's own and then came back and has come and gone since sometimes lasting a few days, sometimes a few weeks. When it is back wearing a bra is uncomfortable. Sometimes there is a warmth or burning sensation in the area. The only other symptoms I have had that I think are related are these: A few months before this started I experienced a fluttering sensation, almost like when I was pregnant and the baby moved, in the same location, a couple of times. Since this has started, on 3 or 4 different occasions, I have experienced a charlie horse like spasm in the same area, below the right rib, when bending over from a sitting position. Does anyone have any answers as to what this might be? Does it sound like IBS? Peptic Ulcer? Hiatal Hernia? ",

Do you suffer from Gastric Reflux? Raising the head end of your bed by about 4 ins helps, as it stops the acid coming back in the night. Certain foods aggravate it, ie Acid foods, fatty foods, alcohol.Having an endoscopy will verify this, but need to see an upper GI specialist first. Good luck",

                "comment_content": "Dry skin is a particularly common cause of itching without a rash, especially as we get older. Sometimes people have dry skin due to an underlying medical condition, such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or Sjogren's syndrome (a disease that typically causes arthritis, dry eyes, and dry mouth). Itchy skin can be a symptom of an underlying illness. These include liver disease, kidney failure, iron deficiency anemia, thyroid problems and certain cancers, including multiple myeloma and lymphoma. When to see your doctor In general, your itchy skin should improve within weeks if you follow simple skin care steps. \u201cIf these changes do not bring relief and are distracting you from your daily routines or affecting your sleep, you should see your dermatologist,\u201d As you can see there are alot of reasons this can be happening. Did you change laundry detergent, fabric softner, ? Do you have dry skin? and this: When to see a doctor See your doctor or a skin disease specialist (dermatologist) if the itching: Lasts more than two weeks and doesn't improve with self-care measures Is severe and distracts you from your daily routines or prevents you from sleeping Comes on suddenly and can't be easily explained Affects your whole body Is accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as extreme tiredness, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, or urinary frequency, fever or redness of the skin If the condition persists for three months despite treatment, see a dermatologist to be evaluated for skin disease and an internist to be evaluated for other diseases. Hope all this helps, I would def have the liver enzymes checked if doc thinks it is warranted. Things can change in a year, I would start with your primary care doc first and go from there, most likely not serious but you want to be sure. If things go sideways on you and you have other symptoms that are more serious go to ER....also check your b-12 levels as well under anemia. Good luck ! ",

There's some mucus but no blood. I went to the doctor, they took blood and stool samples but still waiting to hear back Yesterday i went to the ER, they gave me iv fluids, took blood and urine and both came back fine. Told me to follow up with doctor. It doesn't seem to matter what i eat, bland foods havn't helped, even when i didn't eat all day that didn't help, and eating normal food doesn't seem to make it worse (though really i don't know how much worse it can get). I'm stuggling to keep up with all the fluids i'm loosing. I had an infection in my colon 2 years ago, treated in hospital with antibiotics, colonoscopy 6 months after came back fine. Some very mild ibs since that but normally consipation. I suspect i have polycystic ovary sydrome but never tested. Can any offer any insite? Or help to relieve symptoms in the meantime?",

I suggest trying a probiotic, try to stay as hydrated as possible, when you eat try to eat things with alot of liquids as well, chicken & rice/noodle soups, , etc. and stay with bland foods like brown rice, saltines, toast. I would continue to follow up with your doc, letting them know that dehydration is becoming an issue. You should be able to get the probiotics from amazon very quickly. It should have 15 billion in it, take 2 every 4-6 hours for the first 3 days, then cut back to 2 times a day, see if it has any effects on your symptoms. If it does not you need to do some further testing. Did you eat anything different, make any diet changes, have any injuries, also talk to your OB/GYN of nothing is found with your Gastro and it should be a Gastro , not a primary or GP at that point. I hope the probiotics help you. ",

Phyllium husk will slow down the colon. We have to buy the plain psyllium husk online with no sugar or artificial sweetners because the sugars makes hers worse. I wouldn't eat anything raw either like salads because they are to too hard to digest. If this is an IBS attack you need soluable fiber only at this time...oatmeal (quick cooking oats), bread, rice, etc. Stay away from Insoluble because the fiber in these foods will start you going to bathroom again. Mint tea is good to calm the gut. Something to pay attention to..My daughter seems to get super sensitive to gluten and dairy during her attacks. Hope this helps! ",

                "comment_content": "Hi, First, contact your doctor and follow up with them, if you don't hear anything ask to see a internal medicine doc. Tell them it is urgent, and if no one responds within 24 hours go tot eh ER and tell them you need your pancreas checked asap. You need to know what is going on right away, like ina couple days not a few weeks. Don't freak out, just do that, get a fast appt with the doc, a fast follow up appt, id no response within 24 hours go to the ER. You want to go to the ER so that if there is any treatment necessary that needs to be done right away they can start it. You need to stay hydrated as well. It does snot mean you have cancer. ******************** What is a normal lipase level? When the pancreas is inflamed, increased blood levels of the pancreatic enzymes called amylase and lipase will result. The normal lipase level is 12-70 U/L. Normal values may vary from laboratory to laboratory. What does it mean when your pancreas levels are low? A low level of lipase in the blood may indicate permanent damage to the lipase-producing cells in the pancreas. This can occur in chronic diseases that affect the pancreas, such as cystic fibrosis. ... With acute pancreatitis, there is usually no long-term damage and often no further problems develop. ****************** Stay calm and just do these follow ups. Freaking out wont do you any good, but since you are having pain it need to be looked into. Also check the gallbladder as well. IN the ER they can do scans to see if anything is going on, lie stones etc. Do a ct with contrast. I have had recurring symptoms like this except it also includes nausea and severe upper left abdominal pain and it runs in a cycle of 6-8 weeks, goes away and comes back and it happens during certain moths of the year, Very bizarre, and all numbers are always normal. I know something is very wrong but no one can find out what it is, This is my 5th year of dealing with this. It has altered my life drastically and am now home bound. ",

I have had a few ct scans done with contrast, gall bladder out, a parathyroid gland out, and several hospital stays when it got out of my control, basically I try to treat at home but go in if I cant control the pain etc. I am also awaiting dna full exome testing I had to save up for as insurance wont cover it. I don't hold out much hope of finding out what it is. But I keep trying. I also have another blood test to do but like you am waiting for this scare to be over, but I do have to get prescriptions in a couple days and might just have it done. Try to stay away from people and wash hands etc..I am also live on crowd med now, but after the first few medical detectives talked to me it has been quiet since, so that is kind of a dead end for right now, though they did have some good ideas and have checked those out. I am hoping that in time, that something will happen that will give us a clue as to what this is. It has been very frustrating and also a learning experience for sure. thanks for asking, good luck to you keep us updated !!..Just another suggestion make sure you do the hida test on the gallbladder and not just the scan, :)",

Yellow stool may be caused by conditions that decrease the amount of bile salts reaching the intestines including: ... Cancer or tumors of the liver, the bile ducts, the gallbladder, or the pancreas. Gallstones. Hepatitis (liver infection or inflammation) This is not meant to scare you, if your eyes turn yellow then maybe a liver issue, and more urgent, but I would maybe check the gallbladder if it doesn't clear up, maybe the meds are causing it as well, Ask your doc if the medication could be causing the color change and it may go back to normal after the treatment. Try and stay calm, reach out to your doctor and tell them your issue and request call back. Most likely it isn't a major issue, and can be explained very simply. If it was major you would be having other symptoms I would think, like yellow eyes and skin etc...so just stay calm and ask your doc. THey may want to do a liver enzyme test to make sure you are tolerating the medication ok, again, stay calm, most likely just the healing process, but do reach out. :)... ",

Usually I am asleep by the time it ends. I can tell you the name if interested. So I get that, watch TV show that take your mind off of things, and go for walks or exercise if you can, it uses up nervous energy and makes us feel calmer inside as well. Eat foods that are heavy, but not bad for you, like oatmeal. Can add a bit of fruit. I am pleased the doc called you back and has made you feel a bit more calmer, at least you know he is following it all and it on it. At your appt ask for the hida test for the gallbladder and not just an ultra c=sound. The hida test, tests the functioning of it, not just for gall stones. Good luck !!!",

I hope so deep breathing can be very helpful in stressful situations which you def are in. As long as you breath in through your nose, you can do it longer if needed. As you know taking deep breaths through your mouth will hyperventilate you, you can also do it with patients for both of you..hang in there till you appt date. :) ",

I was also a little bit constipated. during this time my main symptom has been lower abdominal bloating, and my others are fatigue, brain fog, slight lightheadness / dizziness feelings here and there, joint pain. Abnormal stool, mostly where it doesn't seem like food is digested as it was before. Took a stool test for parasites, so far everything was negative in that, had a colonoscopy that came back all clear, nothing at all and was considered very healthy, they took a biopsy to test for celiac, I also had a few blood tests to look for but all the values and the biopsy came back negative. I don't think it's any kind of food allergy cuz I've never been allergic to anything. there's no stones cuz they've done X-rays and three ultrasounds, I have one simple very small cyst in. Overall though everything was considered unremarkable. I've never thrown up, I sometimes pass a little gas but I feel like I've burped more, sometimes that heartburn acidic stomach feel. Again I've not passed stool with blood or throwing up from this.",

Dairy seems to bother a lot of people too...and sometimes lots of raw veggies like salads, just really hard to digest. Since all your test came back negative, I'd bet that it's a food causing your symptoms. Vitamin deficiency could cause problems too. I'd do an elimination diet if I were you. You can research how to properly do this diet. Lots of gluten free options out there too to make it easier. Probiotics would be good too. Hope this helps.",

I am not real sure how long this has been going on, just for the 2 weeks.?...also have you made and recent diet changes, like more fiber or any thing different. Fiber is good, but we need to increase it slowly and not all at once. I am also not sure fi you are male or female. I am thinking male but not sure. If you are by chance female you may want to seek out OB/GYN exam as well. Possibly also an endoscope since you feel a bit of an acidy stuff from stomach when burping and check for the usual stuff, h.pylori, etc..You mentioned a small cyst, where is this located?....Since you are also having joint pain/light headedness/dizzy feelings, maybe check with a Rheumotologist to rule out Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, they kind of go hand in hand. Many folks have both. Have you had any recent surgeries?....I also found this article and may find it helpful as well, https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321755#medical-conditions",

Also have you made any recent changes to your diet. Here are some of the highlights form the article I found: Medical conditions that can cause undigested food to appear in the stool include: Crohn\u2019s disease. This condition is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract that can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition. Celiac disease. This is an autoimmune disorder where the body cannot digest the protein known as gluten that is found in wheat, barley, and certain other grains. Pancreatic insufficiency. If a person has a pancreatic insufficiency, they lack enzymes in the pancreas, which leads to the inability to break food down. Lactose intolerance. If a person\u2019s digestive system is unable to break down the protein in milk and dairy, it may indicate lactose intolerance. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a common condition that affects the large intestine and causes bloating, pain, diarrhea, or constipation. A stomach bug, or gastrointestinal virus, may also cause undigested food in the stool due to food passing quickly through a person\u2019s system. Other symptoms of a stomach bug include: fever bloating abdominal cramping diarrhea vomiting nausea body aches malaise, or a general feeling of being unwell In most cases of a stomach virus, symptoms will resolve in a few days when the virus has passed. If someone notices the following symptoms plus undigested food in their stool, they should see their doctor: unexplained weight loss blood in stool changes in bowel habits loss of control of bowels chronic diarrhea persistent abdominal pain or cramping persistent bloating or gas If a doctor suspects that a person has a digestive system condition, they may order the following diagnostic tests: a stool sample to look for blood and other abnormalities in the stool blood tests to look for nutritional deficiencies or inflammation markers endoscopy to look inside the upper digestive tract colonoscopy to examine the lower gastrointestinal tract biopsy to check for microscopic inflammation Outlook Most of the time, seeing undigested food in the stool is not a cause for concern. It may be the result of eating too fast or eating food with a high-fiber content. In situations where a person has other symptoms, including abdominal pain, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits and movements, they may have an underlying medical condition. Fiber refers to the indigestible part of plant foods. When a person eats high-fiber foods, it is common for some undigested material to appear in the stool because the body cannot fully break down the tough material. Fiber also speeds up a person\u2019s bowel movements by adding bulk to the stool, which encourages the intestinal walls to move. This movement pushes food through the digestive tract. If food moves too quickly through the digestive system, it is more likely that some foods will be less fully digested. Certain foods are more likely than others to be partially digested and appear in the stool. These foods include: beans seeds corn peas vegetable skins leafy greens certain grains carrots raisins nuts Food such as corn is a common offender. Corn has an outer shell made of an indigestible material called cellulose. The body digests the material on the inside of the corn and expels the hard outer casing in the stool. Eating too quickly Another harmless culprit of undigested food appearing in stool is eating too quickly. When a person eats too fast and swallows their food without fully chewing it, the food is more likely to pass through the digestive tract without being completely broken down. Eating too quickly may force digestion to take place too rapidly, which can result in more food not being fully broken down. To avoid this, a person can slow down their eating during meals and chew their food better. Hope all this helps you ! ",

I don't suggest any medicine to stop the diarrhea, as it is trying to clean the bug out of your system. Drink as much liquids as you can, stay with the light diet, if in a few days, say 3-4 days you do not turn around or you develop other symptoms or become very dehydrated(weak/shaky etc) go to the ER. But give the bug a chance to get out of your system. Did you eat any food that could have caused food poisoning, I would avoid tea if it has caffeine in it for now, herbal tea is ok. Brown rice is good to eat, chicken noodle soup and plain saltines, or just the saltines. see how you do. Any anti biotics recently? drink, drink, drink...ok, update us...",

        "post_content": "Hello everyone. I'm a 32 year old male, Long story here. I fairly recently started a ketogenic high fat high protein, low carb diet. And exercising regularly all was going fine, I felt strange for some days but put it down to keto flu and all the changes going on internally . Then one day I started feeling very not right, nausea sweaty, light headed and tiring easily. I thought I might be having a heart attack, a stroke or maybe a blood clot someplace. (my brother discovered he has a clotting disorder making him more likely to develop them) Went to the gp she checked all the usual Everything fine. I had given up on keto by this point. She put it down to the keto diet which I had only just stopped. But anyway it's been many days since then and although many of the symptoms went, now I feel just strange. My limbs feel heavy even my head. I poop a very light brown stool which I never used to do. I still feel this strange light headedness and as if my balance might be off. I noticed too that my limbs seem to go numb easily sometimes even if standing still my legs sometimes go numb. I have a pain in my neck also and wonder if this is all stemming from nerves in my neck. Anyway, another thing I noticed is all these symptoms seem to be at their worst in the morning and improve through the day. Anyway all this couldn't have come at a worse time with the virus going around and all that, hard to get hold of medical help and I'm far from a rich man. I'm at a loss as to what to do. Thanks for any help or support you can give. Sorry I wasn't sure what category to post this in, I'm really not at my best right now. Cheers. Dean Additional Info. I ate a lot of sushi, a lot of raw salmon not all that long before all this started. I suspected it for a while but now I'm not too sure of anything. ",

                "comment_content": "HI, first thing I want to say is for your safety I would not ever eat raw or under cooked fish, I know a lot of folks do it but if I showed you what can happen you would never touch it again. If we were still cavemen and our stomach were still in the time period we would most likely be ok, but we have changed our gut flora and it is not made any more to eat raw fish/meat safely. I realize that to some it is very good, but I don't feel it is worth the risk, There are a lot of ways to prepare fish cooked that is very delicious. I am not telling you not do it, it is always your choice, but I do not recommend it. The other things is the best and healthiest way to lose weight or to be healthy is not on any kind of fad diet, including the keto. Fad diets are not good for you, you are making a drastic change to your body and it doesn't know what you are doing or why, it can only react. It can be very traumatic to your system to do these types of diet, and start it over night. If you are determined to do a diet, introduce it to your body slowly over time so it can adjust and you can tell if your body is not happy with it. It is like surgery, we know that we are going in for surgery, but all your body knows is that something attacked it and it goes into protective mode immediately, even though we may have 2 tiny little holes, we still had invasive surgery and your body didn't know you had it planned, all it can do is react like it was attacked. The absolutely, best way to diet, or to eat healthy is to eat fruits, veggies, cooked fish, if you eat meat, not often and make it lean. All the veggies and fruit you can eat. Nuts are excellent for you in small amount. Skip the diets, eat right and exercise if you can and that is how you stay healthy. When it comes to sweets do so in moderation and in small servings.Have a sweet only once a week for a long time. As you reduce your sugar intake you will naturally need less and less to taste sweetness. After awhile, everything will taste like salt after reducing your salt intake, and fats will no longer taste good, in fact after being away from them, they will actually make you feel crappy. You don't need to do all this at once, first do less salt the first few weeks, until you think everything taste like a salt shaker, you are there..never salt food, you don't need it, what does a real potato taste like ???., then go to the sugar, soon things will be to sweet to you and so on. Basically eat as healthy as you can, fruits, veggies, and nuts. Many other foods are very good for us. If you need advice get a list, ask your doctor. After doing this for a year, your taste will have changed and you will not want sugar or salt etc. But above all don't force yourself as that will backfire, take it at your pace, set your goals and adhere to them, It has to be your choice to do it. Now to your symptoms. Have you ever been checked for being diabetic, your fasting blood sugar, and also a total full cbc with blood calcium checked as well. Also you can ask to have your own clotting factor checked as well, at least then you will know, if your doc feels there is a danger they can put you on aspirin or blood thinners. If you don't want to go to docs, you can get blood sugar kits online and do your own checking, only thing is then you will have maybe a useless kit. The numbers are pretty easy to understand. When these symptoms happen and you eat some candy does it make it go away, or drink some juice? You are still young for diabetes, but some folks get it young, it does happen. Also if it doesn't clear up, you may want to check other hormones in your body, like thyroid, my guess is that you body is still trying to recover from that keto thing, and hopefully in time it will recover, Make sure you are getting plenty of rest, listen to your body, if you are tired and rest. Don't over do right now, give your body time to readjust to a reg diet again. If it doesn't clear up then go back and get more testing. Give it a few weeks, maybe 3 weeks after all the blood work results, if all ok, and see how you feel, if you have any major symptoms go to the er. ",

Yes i had my blood sugar levels checked and all is normal with them. As for cbc and blood calcium levels no not checked. You're 100 percent right such a drastic change in diet was pure idiocy on my part. I am still with the exact same symptoms although I have noticed that if I go out walking in the day it seems to improve as the day progresses. Keeping well hydrated seems to help too. I'm keeping my spirits up but what with the virus going on its hard to know what medical services will be available a few weeks from now. Thanks once again. ",

I am going on 5 years with an un-diagnosed illness involving severe upper left ab pain, and nausea and a slew of other symptoms and no one knows what is wrong with me, so in these 5 years I have learned alot and want to share it with others, I know what it is like to feel like no one cares, and we are out there in no man's land and docs are just not on top of stuff today. You get your 15 min and then your gone and they are on to the next patients, If you have anything that takes more then 15 min and a diagnostic test to figure out you are pretty much out of luck..lol..if you change your diet now, this is very good, you can still eat some goodies, but really cut down on them, when I eat an orange now it tastes like desert it is soo sweet. One day you will say the same and want that orange instead of cake. Hard to believe but it does happen over time. I am still bad at times, I eat a cookie here and there but overall if you give your body good foods it will respond in kind. And yes, exercise as much as you can, when ever you can. I used to walk 12 miles a week, now I cant even walk a block and it is so hard to think of whom I used to be. I am now waiting on the dna testing hoping for some answers. But hang in there, after a few weeks you may feel back to normal and I sure hope so. I don't wish Gastro issues on anyone..lol..or any health issues for that matter. I guess I do this cause I want folks to know that someone out there cares. And I have learned alot over the last few years and also that I was a self made medical student of sorts, it has been my passion in life, science, anatomy, biology etc. while other teens were reading Glamour I was reading Scientific American.....lol..I had a good start, but lost my chance to be a surgeon due to not being able to go to college etc...Genetic research was a big hobby of mine as well. In my thirties I finally got to go back and get a 2 year degree in Human Service which is like counseling and the brain and meds. etc...I was on the Deans list and honor student and sooo wish I could have gotten a bachelors, but it just didn't work out for me. ok, life happens....enough of all that and life's regrets, look to the future and feeling good !!! Keep us updated on your progress. !!!",

My doctor prescribed bronchodilators and i could breath well for the period of treatment. Anway after completing the drugs i still struggle to breath when standing/walking, its better when I sit down and much more better when i lie down (by my side). I'm suspecting a Paralyzed Diaphragm..

If they find something wrong, ask to be sent on to a specialist in that area. There can be many causes for what you are feeling, but your main fear is the paralysis possibility.

        "post_content": "Hello All, My gut issues started back in February of 2018 right after I ate a fast food burger. The symptoms have changed over the past two years which is quite strange but here is all that I have experienced since February of 2018: 1. Bloating. Even when I ate small meals or nothing at all, I would constantly be bloated. I still get this now but to a lesser degree. 2. Feeling of being full even after small meals. 3. Loss of appetite. No hunger whatsoever. I eat just because I know I need to. 4. Excessive flatulence. 5. Excessive belching. Within 1 minute of eating, I begin to belch. 6. Loss of weight. Back in 2018 I dropped from my normal 155 to under 140 in a matter of weeks. My weight goes back up but when I have these flare ups with my stomach, I lose weight unexpectedly. 7. Upper abdomen pain. Right below my sternum, I feel a \"rawness\"/\"tender\" feeling. When its quite in the room, I also hear my upper abdomen making noises. 8. Extremely bad breath as if something died in my gut. 9. Less frequent bowel movements. Feels like my digestive system system is just not working to move things. 10. Constipation. 11. My urine is cloudy and smells foul. 12. Tarry stool from time to time. 13. Worst part of all is as of late, I have had some weird symptoms on my head. Extensive brain fog. Feels like im \"loopy\" sometimes as if I had something to drink. Just a feeling of being \"out of it\". Mind is not clear and sharp. Feels like im living in a haze. 14. Been told that my face is pale. Any pointers as to what I might have would be appreciated! Thank you so much. -Thomas",

Started having trouble getting a deep breath in last week (that I was constantly yawning to get one), getting upper chest pains, and had a constant fullness in my abdomen. Had eaten lentils twice the week before which caused so much gas! I know...bad for IBS. Doctor prescribed an inhaler because I had described it as a feeling of resistance or constriction at the top of my breath. The inhaler has seemed to make all it worse. I can breathe better, but it causes more chest pains, makes my lungs sore, and makes my bloating and GERD worse. This last year has been a totally new experience with the IBS and GERD stuff. Ive had more gas, pains, and bloating then I've ever had. I've also experienced the difficulty getting in a deep breath...but this is a whole new level. Ot slightly better in the morning after a BM and I can breathe a little better, but its still there. Anyone had this? I'm afraid to eat anything at this point. How about inhaler use? Has it made symptoms worse? Thanks in advance for the response! ",

I had a deficiency in vitamin D and I was low in B12 and started taking the spray form of both. I used to get dizzy, nauseas, I had constant stomach problems, my nails were really weak, my hair started to fall out in big clumps when I washed it, I found it hard to concentrate and I had really bad insomnia, taking these supplements really helps me. Also B12 is supposed to help with aches and pains. Are you taking any medication at the moment? I suffer with bruxism and got botox in my masseters a few times, I had to have loads for it to have an effect because my jaw is so strong, but I had a bad reaction the last time and felt dreadful after for weeks, really achy and had flu like symptoms. I have never had it done since then. I have since found out that botox in that area is really bad. It can give you bone loss and cause arthritis in your jaw. So avoid that if it isn't helping, as it can create more health problems than it solves. It only ever worked for me for a couple of weeks at a time anyway. Have you tried those heated eye masks for your eyes, 5 minutes in the morning and evening? After you use them, you get a cotton bud with a preservative free eye wash on it and wipe your inner lid just under the lashes. Also have you tried systane ultra hd preservative free eye drops or liquifilm tears preservative free drops? I have had a problem with dry eyes for years too and this really can help. ",

Not sure if that's why you're feeling more bloated after consuming it. I have ibs too and was living in hell till I understand that some food are aggravating my condition. Been following fodmap diet(not 100% though cos its tough when I eat out) and taking Slippery Elm. I understand how you're feeling cos I was also afraid to eat anything due to pain and bloating. Hope this helps. ",

Also there is a cereal that makes gas come out of me and others who have tried it, dont exactly know how it works but it does. It is called simply granola and has one with raisins and one with almonds, I like the almonds as it is less sweet. After eating a couple cups of it, the next day gas pours out of me and it is a nice relief. Have you had an endoscope done, checked for h. pylori, and also talked to a cardiologist to just be sure nothing in that area is going on. Also a lung/chest x-ray. Relaxation breathing exercises and progressive relaxation t night for sleep, sleeping on your side and not your back. If you are not getting enough sleep may be why you are yawning too. Which doc prescribed the inhaler, if it isn't a allergist or pulmonologist then it should not have been prescribed, If you are just seeing a general doc, you need to go to specialists. Get more testing, scans etc. done to see inside. Have you don't all the GI testing, swallow test, etc...Check Gallbladder too.",

I am a hypochondriac and also have severe anxiety, bad to the point that I can't sleep for days on no end if I ever do have an anxiety attack. I am worried that it could be some kind of cancer... :( But it could also be ibs, maybe gluten sensitivity... I don't know... These are current symptoms that I have been experiencing. 1. feels like there's something at the entrance and it's blocking poop from coming, therefore making it come out much smaller (this one I am the most worried about, it sounds like...cancer to me) 2. get no urge to poop anymore. 3. fiber doesn't seem to be working as much 4. recent change in bowel movements, got worse since november- december, I think. Till now. 2020, march... 5. sometimes get mucus in stool, not very often... Please reply soon... I am at a healthy weight, I don't do anything bad, smoke or drink, I eat lots of fiber, and drink lots of water. ",

Are your docs listening to you, are they brushing you off and telling you nothing is wrong without doing further testing. If they are, then I would insist on further testing and if this doc wont take you seriously then find a new doc. Are your parents involved and helping you at all?...Are you taking birth control pills, as they can have some effects on our body as well, do you take any other kind of medication, over the counter, prescription or recreational? If you are unable to eat, you need to find out why, have you ever had an eating disorder?..If you cant get into see a doc soon, try drinking Max Protein Ensure to make sure you get all the nutrients you need. It is low in sugar and good in what your body needs. Stay hydrated, this is very important and can also cause yawning. When you do eat, eat fruits and veggies. No junk. Have you tried a laxative, have you had a OB/GYN exam to make sure nothing is wrong with your pelvis and rectum. area. If your uterus is prolapsed it can tilt to an angle that makes pooping more difficult but usually effects older women more, women who have had children. Overall seeing a good gastro and OB/GYN should be your first moves, they can determine if what tests are needed, scans etc. Good luck and dont be embarrassed by all of this, that is why there are gastro's and OB/GYN's and other specialist, to them this is a daily subject, no biggy.

I find things like avacado and olives really help with constipation. A cup of green tea in the morning also helps move things along. Aloe vera juice has amazing health benefits as well as helping with constipation. You could also try kefir yoghurt drink once a day, it helps your gut bacteria. Anxiety can definitely affect your bowels so you should try something like yoga and meditation to relax. Sleep is so important for your health, you really need to find some relaxation techniques, look them up on google. When you learn to relax and sleep better, everything is much easier.",

Should i be worried that no letter or phone call has been arranged on these scan results? i know there isnt because his secretary confirmed that there was no letter or phone call arranged by the doctor once they viewed the scan on the 7th feb. Just slightly worried the doctor will deliver some not so good news and has waited over 6 weeks to tell me. Just some advice would be nice. Thank you. ",

If the GP/primary wont do anything else, move on to another doc, and depending on what insurance you have you may not need a referral to see a specialist in internal. You do not offer your weight, age etc..so cant comment on that. Any prior surgeries or what caused the hernia's to happen. If you are concerned about the kidney pain see a urologist. Basically you need to see inside and what is actually going on if you have not done that yet, scans etc. Good luck.",

I was told it wasn't urgent for operation and after a check request by the GP, i was told to change what i eat and how much and no lifting. Also i cannot wear a belt any more because if i sit down my inguinal H. starts to hurt. i will make a appointment about a ultra sound about the kidney stones. ",

Talking to my mom on the phone, she says that the fish market that sold it to her said no more than 5 days in the fridge. So I look it up, and they're absolutely correct - great. Immediately after eating the fish, I am feeling lightheaded/dizzy/disassociated. These symptoms might be from any of the following reasons: I currently have a cold with congestion; panic; or the isotrentinoin I take, which dries out my sinuses and gives me headaches. Right after I ate the smoked trout, I took a shot of apple cider vinegar with honey (idk, anti-bacterial?) and had a banana (to dilute the amount of bad food in my stomach??). My mind keeps going back to that story of that kid in Belgium who ate the pasta that was at room temp for 5 day and died from food poisoning in his sleep. Should I be that concerned? Or just monitor symptoms and seek medical help if I have any of more extreme signs? I not very nauseous yet, and honestly any slight nausea I'm experiencing could be from the vinegar shot. Hahlp, I'm panicking.",

                "comment_content": "Taking pain medication on a reg basis will cause constipation, the best laxative to use is Miralax, it is very gentle and does not absorb the medication from your system like Metamucil will. This is very important as it can absorb any medication you take and you wont get the dose at all. Start taking the Miralax as soon as you can, take the full dose everyday at first, as your bowels begin to move you can adjust the dose as you need to per your system. Give it 2-3 days to start working, and then take it everyday and eventually you will get your dose correct. This is what patients with chronic pain must do. You do not want to stay constipated and Miralax is the recommended laxative when on any kind of medication, not Metamucil types. Miralax works by bringing water into and around your stool, making it move easier through your system. If you take to much it can give you diarrhea, but right now you just want to get things moving. Once you do that you can work with the dose and get it right. In the beginning as your bowels move, you may experience some cramping as the stool has become hard, and may be painful moving through, but you must get it out. It will not harm you, just may be carmpy, or may not be. Good luck and if this doesn't solve your issues, you need to go to a gastro to see if anything else is going on. ",

The one that causes the pain in your liver is the painkiller itself. Liver function is to detoxify any harmful agents that pass through our system including drug medications.

Miralax comes in the form of a white powder, which is dissolved in water or another drink and then swallowed. A generic version is available and is often cheaper than the branded version. It is sold in the UK under the name Movicol. You can add it to most foods, soups etc... As far as the comment on the pain medication, take it as directed by your physician, if you have chronic pain then you may be taking it long term. Contrary to popular belief everyone responds differently to pain medications. Many pain patients remain on a constant dose for decades and never up that dose. A few patients need higher doses depending on how their body metabolizes pain meds. This will be for you and your Pain specialist to work out. Many misconceptions are out there right now due to the fake opioid crisis , the issue has never been prescription medications, it is illegal drugs that are causing the overdoses etc. I have studied this closely, best thing is to listen to your doctors orders on the pain meds, only he can tell you how you as an individual should take them. ! Liver damage can also come from taking to much Tylenol and ibuprofen, so only take the recommended does and as little as possible. Do not mix either with alcohol as that is harder on the liver. Some pain medications already have Tylenol in it, so ask your pharmacist this question before taking any more to be safe. !!! https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/picture-of-the-colon#1 On this picture of the colon, you can see that the ascending colon and descending colon go up very high to just below the liver and just below the stomach, that is why you may experience pain from constipation if your bowels are backed up to that degree, also as the hard stool moves through the colon on its way out of the rectum, it can cause some cramping etc. Also notice there are a couple of very sharp turns at the tops of the colon and these can be painful when hard stool moves around those curves. I hope you can see the picture and the location of the 2 sides of the colon. The poop actually comes out at the end of the your left side. It is un-likely you will be backed up that much but you may have some hard stool in those areas that can cause pain/cramping etc. If you find the laxative in the UK, isn't helpful after a few days 3-5 days , move on tot eh Gastro. I think the main thing with your case is to see if the miralax helps you after a few days, if you continue to keep having constipation from the paid meds that the laxative doesn't help with 5 days then you should def see your gastro doc.

A couple of years ago I had a scope done and &#160;found I had H Pylori and the doctor wanted to put me on this antibotic mixture and people said don&#39;t do it as makes things worse. I went to the health store and they sold me Mastica Chios Gum and Hospital Bacteria Defence and told to take 1 of each 3 times a day for 2 weeks and it seemed to help and &#160;I did it for 2 more weeks and felt better. Just lately things started up again and dr said it was stress and depression and put me on medication that did not go well for me. I went back to the health store and bought the 2 products again and started taking them today was the &#160;first day I didn&#39;t need a antinausea pill. Not sure if the HPylori has come back but I am going to take these items again with hope it works as I am tired of being sick every day. I suggest give it a try but I think you need to take the both pruducts together. Hope this helpful. I plan on doing my own blog to show &#160;what I am dealing with and what I am doing to see if others have other suggestions or if I can help others.</p>",

Also ask for her to have a H.Pylori test this is done by stool or breath test...children can get HPylori as well ss adults. This bacteria lives in the stomach and causes dreadful acid reflux and sickness. Don't be afraid to go back to your gp and ask for the test if it is negative then the endoscopy. Under the Patients Charter for England and Wales you are entitled to a second opinion....assuming you live in UK....hope this helps..... best wishes...",

                "comment_content": "First of all, I would like to say that I feel for both you and your daughter. It is so very difficult to be ill in the first place. To have a child sick is one of the most difficult things a mother can endure. I feel your pain and truly hope that she is better soon. Take the time while she cannot do her usual aciivites to hopefully create a few good memories as well. Make some \"special\" times when she feels up to it, to color, cuddle and watch a favorite tv show, etc. I totally agree that she should have some further gastro intestinal studies done. As someone else said, some of the medications may be contributing to her nausea. It is difficult to isolate so you may want to try removing one at a time(hopefully working with a pediatric gastroenterologist who CARES). Did she have any illnes prior to the onset of her GERD. Just wondering if they may have given her an antibiotic which could have upset her normal gastrointestinal flora. Antibiotics will kill the \"bad\" bacteria but also kills the \"good\" bacteria that help in digestion. A good pro-biotic helps to put back the good bacteria that aids in digestion.Especially in a sensitive tummy. Yogurt contains a few good cultures, but one that is used quite often in Texas is found in the regrigerator isle at your local market. It comes in small bottles, and is called a \"probiotic cultured dairy beverage\". There are several brands, you might want to google and if your market does not carry it, request that they order for you. Just a suggestion, but little tummies are very sensitive and when the cultures are off it sometimes makes a big difference. Just like when children(or even adults) travel and get travelers constipation, diarrhea or GERD. I hope that this helps, it is so hard on us all when we get ill and can't find answers. Good luck and I will keep you in my prayers.",

Tried omeprazole but it&#39;s got corn in. Tried the other one had a bad reaction rash ect. Now trying gavisgon. We finally got her prem doc to refer her to a tummy specialist appointment Monday. She can&#39;t take much more. I will let u know how we get on. X</p>",

My daughter hasn\u2019t lost weight -but vomits small amounts up to 30 times a day obviously very disruptive for her day to day life. We are also waiting for an appointment with a gastro specialist.

In the very beginning I was a bit constipated but it's not bad now. Had a colonoscopy done, all clear, as in come back 10 years from now. It was that clean I guess. They took a biopsy to look for Chron's and that came back negative. Has blood work done, overall it was fine I was told. White blood cell count was slightly low, I've had a slightly high bilirubin count for years. Vitiman D is low, I moved a couple years ago to a place with much less sunshine. I see that there may be a connection between IBC and low vitiman D. I did take an O & P test, awaiting results. Have had two ultrasounds and they said everything looked good, no stones of any kind and with a kidney that has simple cysts. The doctors claim that is common and shouldn't be a problem. Overall just bloated, some fatigue, sometimes feel dizzy. Bowel movements mostly back to normal though sometimes the food is much less digested. ",

Just a thought. Test for H. pylori as well during the endoscope. Check for celiac disease and trail and error removing with wheat products from your diet. Also suggest the ct scan with contrast to see all of the abdominal organs well. Do the gall bladder hida test even if it looks good on the ct scan. Talk with your doc more if you still have issues. Keep a food diary, and if you remain constipated use the miralax as needed. I would also check into the slightly high liver enzyme test as well, a bile duct specialist, or similar doc. And the low white blood count, make sure you are not anemic, check Vit B-12 levels as well. Test for hepatitis, do you seem to get alot of infections?...if so check for Leukopenia., most likely not, but u want to be sure, it may just be IBS starting, but you want to check all the bases. Also check for markers of high inflammation in the body by a rheumotologist. Good luck and just do one thing at a time, the easiest first, like checking your b-12 levels, and go from there. ",

A russian scientist name Kouchadoff found out that \"cooked\" food *increases white blood cells rapidly in the small intestine* to combat hostile invaders in our system. * Dr. Bircher-Benner found out that eating raw food prevented formation of white blood cells.* Since you feel full fast, I suspect this is because of undigested food from your stomach that causes pain. There are chemoreceptors in our gut lining that detects the stretch and content of our gut. So why try to eat more raw food like lettuce salad, fresh green juice? They are rich in enzymes and fiber that could digest your food easily. And drink a lot of water to flush all toxins. ",

        "post_content": "I am a 14 year old healthy girl, and I have never had any serious health problems or allergies. Almost five days ago, on Wednesday afternoon I started feeling a dull pain covering my upper right abdomen and radiating into my right thigh while I was running. I walked back home, but in the next hours the pain worsened. It faded way by the evening though, and didn't come back before the morning after. The next day, the pain was pretty much the same, a bit milder though. I went to the toilet and everything like normal and haven't noticed any changes there. On Saturday though, the the pain came usually 30 minutes at a time, with breaks in between. On Sunday, the pain was sharper, but happened in shorter periods at a time. Today, on Monday, the pain is almost constant, but I barely feel it if I sit still. It's moved closer to my bellybutton, almost right next to it, on the right side still. I also feel a dull, mild pain under my bellybutton when I go to the bathroom, or flex my abdomen muscles. When I apply pressure to any point in my stomach, I feel a sting on the right side of my bellybutton where the pain is otherwise. I haven't taken any painkillers in the past two days, but I took ibuprofen and paracetamol (1000mG altogether I think) on Saturday, 500mG on Thursday, and 500mG twice on Friday. I am convinced this is unrelated to my menstruation. The pain hasn't been severe, but sharp and obviously painful in the time periods I experienced it and as any other human being, I want it to stop. I have hesitated to go to the doctor because of the Corona Virus as we are in times where the hospitals cannot afford false alarms or mild cases like this one. I used to think it was just gas trapped in my intestines, but I am getting a little worried as time has passed. I do not have a fever, I have not thrown up, been constipated or had diarrhoea. ",

If you feel like it may be gas, you can also try charcoal capsules which will absorb the gas the bring it out of your body, but it can also absorb any medications you take. Ask your pharmacist how many hours apart you should take the medication and the charcoal capsules. Taking such high doses of the ibuprofen and Tylenol is ok short term, but you don't want to continue that without a doctors orders. If this continues it is best to go ahead and see your GP first, if you don't find any help there see your OB/GYN next, and if nothing there see the gastro, if you want you can also see the gastro first if you feel it is more inside and not related to the period. Only you can know which one is best. Good Luck.",

        "post_content": "Hello I am new. I have lifelong IBS issues, which are under reasonable control, but unfortunately I have Functional (Non Ulcer) Dyspepsia now diagnosed recently on top after an endoscopy and ultrasound. They found a small hiatus hernia, and gallstone, but consultant still seems to think it's the FD that is the issue. I have chronic relapsing/remitting pain high up under my ribs in the middle of my abdomen. I often get bouts that last for days, though they usually ease after a week. The pain causes migraine, and I feel pretty desperate to get it to go which normally it does eventually until the next bout a few weeks later. I have eliminated a huge number of foods from my diet, but don't want to take any more out as it's healthy and balanced still. I don't take anything for it medication wise, but see a medical herbalist. I did use PPIs for around 4 years at the beginning when I was diagnosed with gastritis/duodenitis, but they were not helping and so I stopped them as I read that long term use wasn't a great idea. I then felt that foods made a big difference but I am beginning to wonder as I seem to have to cut so many and the list increases......",

                "comment_content": "Hi I am sorry to hear that you suffer from Functional Dyspepsia. My daughter (26) was diagnosed with (FD) a few months ago after literally coming home from work one night, about six months ago, saying she had a funny tummy. She was in horrendous pain and being sick. She hardly slept and had to have time off work. Also being extremely stressed didnt help. After every test going, which came back normal, except food is very slow at moving/digesting, she was given the diagnosis of FD. It has also affected her bowel movements. She is definitely improving, although very slowly, but still in pain most of the time. Obviously stress makes it worse and she has found having soya milk helps. She cannot tolerate alcohol or red meats. But isnt too bad with plain fish, mushy peas and a jacket potato. Meat is a no no. She found using a nutribullet really helped her and gave her the vitamins and minerals she needed (spinach, various fruits, flax seeds) She is now able to go to the gym again as before any exertion irritated it. She was taking emozul (PPI) 80mg a day but suffered from dead fingers. But now able to cope on 40mg. She has better days than others but definitely improving. I have googled lots on this subject and one thing that came back was pregablin (Lyrica) gives pretty good results after a few months of use. This is a nerve medication used for people suffering from epilepsy. So she is going to try this. She has also started counselling and hoping that cognitive behavioural therapy will help with her coping mentally, especially going out socialising. Our main concern is after having tests she is having problems with moving her bowels so looking for answers to that as prescribed laxatives do not help whatsoever and now has to use enemas couple of times a week. Do you have problems with your bowels? ",

                        "comment_content": "Hello there NLW-AW and thank you for sending me a PM as I probably would not have found your reply. I find this site baffling at the moment! Are you in the UK? I find mainstream medicine is very slow in this area and they are not keeping up with research that is being done. My own Gastro recommended a drug (Domperidone) which has now been withdrawn by NICE and can cause cardiac arrest, so I would not have wanted to use it - especially not recommended over aged 60 which I am. It might be helpful if your daughter looks into Gastroparesis (maybe google for info) as that sounds to be more the kind of thing that is involved for her and it is recognised in the UK http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gastroparesis/Pages/Introduction.aspx Have they looked into this? It's known as a motility disorder and most of the drugs used for it have been withdrawn in the Uk because of possible risks. I think Domperidone is still used for short courses if there is nausea/vomiting. I have also just found that there is some great research into FD being done mostly via a brilliant man called Prof Nick Talley who is Australian. If you google you will probably find some more out, but here are a couple of links.... http://www.newcastle.edu.au/profile/nicholas-talley http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4070654/ He has also done some research in the last few years comparing pain killers to help and Amitriptylene came out as useful compared with an SSRI, so I am thinking of asking for that. I had not heard of Lyrica being used for this but I see it is used for fibromyalgia pain. Not sure it would be so good for me as I have lowish platelets and it sounds as if could affect that. It is quite hard to find useful info to help with FD but as you say, changing diet helps a lot. I have been dealing with FD for years actually - at least 10 and it has got worse over last 5, but didn't know that is what I had. I was diagnosed with Gastritis/Duodenitis some 11 yrs ago and thought that's what I had still! So in this time my diet is VERY restricted now - I eat virtually no processed foods - and as I also have IBS I am further restricted. I do have meat, but as you say, red meat not so good, though I am still eating some. I have chicken mostly, and fish, nuts, seeds, a little fruit (mostly apples, pears and bananas), most veg but limited carbs, sheep or goat yogurt, and a little goat cheese and eggs and coconut and olive oil and a little Apple Cider Vinegar. Not much else, but at least it's a balanced diet. I don't actually have nausea, and I pass motions 2 or 3 times a day, so no problems with that. It's just the pain of it drives me to distraction. I have bad bouts every 3 to 4 weeks and they last around 5 days, and then the bout passes usually. Like your daughter I have been using smoothie maker for some years (a Vitamix) but now for some reason I am having more problems with the liquid. If I have small amounts it is fine, but I cannot drink very much in one go. Solids are easier again though. The chap I mentioned above has identified 2 sorts of FD and one is your daughter's sort which is more to do with motility, and the other sort is the kind I have which is more to do with pain. It sounds as if she has pain as well though, so maybe she it's not that simple!",

I also eat organic sprouted cream of rice, which I also grind up in my blender and boil on the stove. I am at a loss at what to eat, as everything is making my symptoms worse. I eat bunny graham's, since they are bland. I also have IBS. What are your food reccomendations?

She is keeping a food diary at the moment to see if there is a pattern somewhere. From what I have read you seem to be doing the same thing as my daughter has done. From information I have read I believe people who suffer from FD seem to suffer in different ways. I have also read that one person's FD went and came back so my daughter is just trying to take one day at a time. Interesting to see you do not have problems with your bowels which I will pass onto her. Thank you for those links which I will read. And finally yes we are from England. Where are you from? ",

Sorry I gave you some wrong info re the Prof in Australia identifying the 2 kinds of Functional Dyspepsia - I forgot to look them both up, and got that a bit wrong, though since then I have read a report that identified more than 2 kinds of FD actually, but it was an old one. I wonder if I don't have trouble with my bowels because I have spent the last 5 yrs working on them due to the IBS issues I also have. I have been cleaning up my diet so that I take in very little sugar (just a little in fruit), have virtually no processed foods, gluten or very few grains, no preservatives, as all of these things disagree with me so badly. I also have researched Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (known as SIBO) which some researchers in the US now believe is the cause of much of IBS, and they prescribe an antibiotic to help eradicate this. I am pretty sure I have this in a mild way, but am using Oil of Oregano which works very well for me. I also have used probiotics and make my own kefir, and use live yogurt as some people think that the lack of good gut flora are involved in many stomach issues that people have, and may also be implicated in other illnesses. There is also the whole subject of Leaky Gut which I have looked into which is not recognised by NHS mainstream but no doubt they will catch up in the end. Another whole arena is that of Mast Cell Activation which I am beginning to explore, and which may be implicated in Functional Dyspepsia perhaps. The thing that bothers me regarding the food issues is that unfortunately my FD has if anything got worse over the years even with cutting out foods, though I do have some better spells with it. Sometimes it seems to me that I get a bad bout even when I have eaten the same as usual!",

It can cause many illnesses including IBS. I suffer from Candida but have other symptons. Cutting out sugar and yeast, including fruit is a start. But really I would recommend seeing a good nutritionist who deal with Candida Albicans. But I would warn you it can take a long time and you can feel worse at times by the 'die off' symptons you get as the candida dies. There are other good nutritionists about who deal with Candida but they tend to just get you on the right track to feeling better but not completely clearing it. I think everyone has decide what they want to do. Thank you for the information and I wish you well in getting better. If I get any other information I will let you know.

The most that ever showed up was that I might have mild dybiosis. It was suggested by the private Dr that I might have Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (though I haven't had the breath test that would confirm this), and I have been treating myself with Oil of Oregano as that is one of the herbal approaches to help with this. Ideally I should also stay off carbs but the reality is that is hard to maintain long term, and also I need some carbs for my thyroid to function so I am cutting them back as much as possible. Hopefully all this will help with the Functional Dyspepsia too, but is early days....",

Also too much liquid in a smoothie can do that also. Domperidone is also not used much now in the UK unless you have vomiting, and then only recommended for short term use. Apparently there was a European edict that came out last year on it as there have been some deaths and bad side effects for some people regarding heart rhythm. Funnily enough my Gastroenterologist has recommended it to my GP, so maybe no one told her......!! I do not plan to try it though. I have a pretty stress free life, so in my case I don't think stress is a big factor.

Although obviously I was dismayed that it returned, It&#39;s encouraging to know that it&#39;s possible for the symptoms to disappear for that amount of time. I ate and drank what I wanted in that time, plenty of alcohol, coffee, chocolate etc. The only thing I can think of that possibly might have changed is that i was drinking smoothies most days at that point and more recently stopped completely due to a broken nutribullet. It might just be a coincidence but it&#39;s worth getting back on them to see what happens, of course it could be a cumulative effect so might need a good few weeks. We know that smoothies can aid digestion anyway so there&#39;s no reason not to give it a go. I hope this offers some encouragement to fellow sufferers. </p><p></p><p>James </p>",

        "post_content": "Hello all, just wanted to talk a little about my surgery. I had to have surgery Thursday because my adhesions ( Which is scare tissue from other surgeries) had rapped itself around my intestines. All this was related to a mesh that was put inside my abdomen because I had a hernia. Well a year later that mesh came apart so they had to go back in and repair it. Well a year after that I developed a groin hernia. A year and some months later I coughed one evening and felt a pain on my left side a little above the hernia by the groin. Well I was a little concerned, because I felt a hard lump, so the next day I went to the urgent care office down the street. They told me it was another hernia and wanted to operate on it. I told them no, because I was a veteran and would have the Veteran Hospital do it. ( Free ) I am happy to say the, VA took care of me by doing a exploration piece, meaning they had to go inside my abdomen to see what was happening. It took them 45 extra minutes to get all of the scar tissue off of my intestines then they repaired my groin hernia. I feel a lot better. ",

        "post_content": "Two days ago, I woke up to heartburns, it was a pretty intense one and it continued 5 more times as I lied down in discomfort. I got up and it stopped but it would occasionally hurt once in a while during the day while I was sitting upright or standing. The 2nd day continued, same way I woke up and the burning continued throughout the day. 3rd day, no more sever burning, and I woke up to nothing but a bloated stomach and a lump in my throat. Occasionally, I would get mild discomfort of what seemed to be a heart burn but wasnt really one. It would bring pain for 3-6 seconds and go away, and causing a tingling sensation in my neck and right shoulder. Its continuing today and I'm not really sure whats happening. Ive been doing some research and I am thinking it is GERD, but also linking my symptoms to dangerous things like esophagus cancer etc. Which is getting me anxious. My question is: What should I do? What might it be? and should I go see a doctor? Especially with the coronavirus outbreak going on as I live in an affected area.",

Do one at a time and see what the results are, also with the tingling sensation and shoulder issue I would also make sure your heart is ok as well. It most likely is so dont be scared, just a precaution. I recommend having all the tests done before taking any of the meds like PPI's. Tums and roll aids by your bed may help, r u taking another kind of medication and are u eating before bed and if so what is it...if no answers also do that hida gallbladder test as well just to be sure.

I'm 28 and having debilitating digestive issues - I've always had a \"sensitive stomach\" and did see a GI specialist 6 years ago she did an Endoscopy only and more or less said I had IBS and sent me on my way. I know lot's of triggers that isn't new to me - dairy will give me issues or deep fried food etc and have had many many a severe stomach pain,diarrhea and nausea moments over this last 6 years just chalking it up to IBS and accepting my fate. The last 3 months have been HORRIBLE every single morning I have severe cramping (like prior to a diarrhea moment) sometimes I go to the washroom sometimes not and it passes for a few hours and returns with vengeance. I often feel nauseas all day and extremely bloated. It seems like every single night after dinner I'm in a ball with severe cramps again and extreme gas - I'd say the cramping and excessive gas is my main issue. I'm not a stranger to stomach issues but I feel so chronically ill it is hard to do anything - I work shifts full time and am so worried about this affecting my job. I have tried Low FODMAP but did not go completely grain free yet - I eat dairy free for the majority of the time I've tried every probiotic which seems to make matters worse,peppermint oil,apple cider vinegar etc. The fact I have had stomach issues frequently has me feeling I'm not being taken seriously. My dad has had Diverticulitis flares since he was 30 and recently has been diagnosed and very ill with Ulcerative Colitis. I've seen my GP 3 times since it ramped up and she did a basic CBC and LFT tests the only thing elevated was my bilirubin but all other liver functions were normal and my abdominal US was normal as well. I had a normal range Fecal Calprotectin Level,Normal Stool Culture & Ova & Negative Ova/Parasites test.I went back again insisting I need to see a GI long story short I am seeing one but it is \"non urgent\" so I have an Endoscopy & Colonoscopy April 30th ... I am terrified its colon cancer or something sinister because it is PERSISTENT - every single day nausea,bloating,on and off diarrhea,low grade cramping that turns into severe make you sweat cramping and excessive gas 24/7. I am so lost and have such a long wait I feel my GP doesn't now what else it could be and more or less has passed me off to the GI in April.",

My actual bowel movements are often soft or diarrhea with excessive gas and cramping/odd smell. I have never seen blood have not lost weight and am not anemic. I have been back to my GP 4 times this year with hopes they could move up my colonoscopy - she feels i dont even need one and its IBS. I am at the point where Ive built up this horrid diagnosis and read stories and am just looking for any comfort during this time. This intermittent cramping daily is awful.",

Go back to your Doctor and mention Gastroparesis to him. with your symptoms, I'm surprised that he didn't think of Gastroparesis himself. Look it up online. There is lots of information on the condition. Gastroparesis is where the stomach and intestines slow right down and sometimes stop completely. Making food hard to digest. The muscles around the stomach and digestive tract don't contract to push the food though the digestive system so food can remain in the stomach for days afterwards. As I mentioned, I'm newly diagnosed with it so I'm pretty much in the same boat as you. I hope this is helpful to you. Your Doctor should be able to arrange tests to diagnose you. Maybe it's not Gastroparesis but certainly sounds like it to me. Regards Dale",

An acidic environment of your stomach while you eat will convert pepsinogen into pepsin, p*epsin is the enzyme that digest protein such as meat. *With that, it is advisable not to drink a glass of water while you are eating so you are not diluting the acid in your stomach.",

Begin to feel better but then again back to same condition. Upper abdomen pain occurs on left and right side under ribs but mostly on left side. Gastro doctor did Complete blood profile along with ESR, Liver functions, Endoscopy as well all normal. So he just prescribed rabeprazole and diagnosed me with gastritis. Although it didnt presented on the gastroscopy. He asked to have an abdominal Ultrasound just for the peace of mind as he believes nothing serious will come up. So why I am not getting better. one thing I admit is that i have habit of binge eating and maybe it makes problem worse. Any suggestions on what to do. Can gastritis cause right side pain under rib also. The pain is occasional only. Thank you",

Also are you drinking anything different, or alcohol which can cause inflammation in some. Also if after a month or so on this med, maybe another one ion the same family will work better, many to try. But diagnosing the issue is the key. PPI's are handed out to much today instead of finding out the issue. Did they test for the h. pylori on endoscope? If you are unable to eat for a long time try Max protein ensure, it is very good.

They make you loose your immunity which causes infection to spread more quickly than the people who don't have that intake. Also try eating at right times, 1 or 2 hours of irregularity is fine though. By sitting habits I mean you need to focus on your sitting hours. Sitting on computer, tv, or games especially just after food. Lifestyle includes the above plus your sleeping hours. Focus on your sleeping hours. Try sleeping atleast 7-8 hours. Don't force yourself awake late at nights. Lack of sleep is also a cause of immunity loss. Include some morning walk and mild exercises for 20 mins a day. Research internet for yog related with stomach issues. If you have been into irregular lifestyle for a long time, it's possible that you may have got some infection. For infection you will need to get antibiotics. However if it's not infection than probably changing your lifestyle with serious efforts will help you to see changes after a month. ",

Also binge eating can be hard on your digestive system, you are pretty young and should be able to tolerate this more then an older person but we are all diff and I would def find out the reason you do it. On exercising, I know it is hard to exercise until you get this issue taken care of. Hang in there, be persistent and don't give up. If one doc doesn't know, go to another one. Also what you are eating, may be an issue, stay away from spicy, high acid etc. ok let us know how u r doing. You are pretty young to have these issues.

The main ones are bowel changes diarrhoea/constipation unusual coloured stools, undigested food in stools, diarrhoea and normal stool during sleep on several occasions. night sweats that wake him up they cause pillows to be wet, and weight loss. he's also got rashes around his mouth, in his nose and on his bum we are using a steroid cream which is helping with that. he has a dairy free diet. hes had two blood tests the first one showed high b12, neutrophils, basophils and slightly elevated platelets. we had an appointment with the paediatrician and they checked celiacs, thryoid function, immunoglobulin, full blood count which all came back normal and the faecal calprotectin came back normal today. my brother has crohns disease so I believe the doctor was looking for signs of inflammation. this week my son has had more episodes of diarrhoea and today my son did a poo that was half grey and half brown, is that normal? the paediatrician is seeing us again in 6-8 months and we have a dietician appointment at the end of march. other than that I believe we are meant to just try and forget/ignore the problems. i'm in two minds wether to do this. My son seems fine in himself but this is affecting his sleep and his eating/weight. we are using movicol daily as of today which was advised by the doctor. i've kept a diary of all problems since october and my son has had 18 episodes of diarrhoea so far. I am thankful that the results showed everything as normal but this is also quite frustrating as it feels like this is never going to end for him. ",

Has he been tested for wheat and gluten intolerance. Try keeping a food and drink diary daily making a note of what he eats and drinks each day and see if a pattern emerges regarding the diahorrea and any other symptoms. Also, does he attend nursery or a playgroup? if so what does he eat there? Are there any children there with the same problems? I hope you can get to the bottom of the problem...best wishes..",

It's always a strange color and she has IBS...anyway, may not be gluten or processed food but it wouldn't hurt to try and take it away and see what happens. oh and fish oils helped my daughter with her inflammation.

        "post_content": "Hi all I was wondering if anyone can help me please. I\u2019m a 27 year old female , very fit, blood pressure normal (slightly raises when I\u2019m anxious but still normal and healthy apparently) oxygen levels 100% and BPM anywhere between 45 beats per minute when resting and 75 beats per minute when a bit more stressed anxious (I do suffer from quite severe anxiety and ocd). I have stopped weight training as much but I used to weight train a lot and lift fairly heavy for a female of my size 172cm 60kg. I would bench 25-30kg and deadlift around 40-60kg. About 2 summers ago I felt an upper abdominal muscle strain / tear when I was doing a 5kg weighted ab exercise, i didn\u2019t think much of it and I ignored it, I can\u2019t remember if I did go to the doctors or much but I don\u2019t remember it causing me too much hassle. anyway it\u2019s 2 years on and I keep getting on and off stomach pain, first it started where I \u2018strained\u2019 my upper abdominal (on the left side) but recently it\u2019s started to radiate anywhere from between under my left rib, to the centre and then to under the right rib. It mainly stays in the centre however right near my sternum but as I said it radiates and currently it feels as if it is where my liver is located. The pain / dull ache / pressure is worse when I project my voice in class (I am a teacher) and also worsens when driving and sometimes taking deep breaths. I can feel it sometimes when I lay on my side to sleep - it feels as if something is weak / dislodged. When I lay down flat on my back I can feel a weird dipping feeling right at the top of my abdomen / lower chest when breathing in, it almost has a ripping sensation but not quite. Anyway I\u2019ve been to the doctors, first I went in November where they gave me an ultrasound and said there was nothing abnormal going on, they told me if the pain continued then I need to go back to the doctor and get different kind of scans or something- anyway by this point the pain had gone. When the pain first came on in November it was made worse by walking / laughing/ talking and seemed to stay around my left upper abdominal. The pain / pressure / ache now radiates and laughing doesn\u2019t seemed to affect it just talking loudly engaging my diaphragm and moving in certain ways, sometimes eating too makes it feel more \u2018pressure\u2019. So I went back to the doctors the other day and he has prescribed me something for stomach acid even though I don\u2019t have any burning sensations, he also has sent for another ultra sound and he felt around my abdomen and didn\u2019t seem to be concerned. I got my blood done aswell for liver etc and came back clear, just waiting on stool sample and ultra sound. I\u2019m just a bit worried because it is affecting my daily life, I\u2019m worried I have done some damage lifting weights (perhaps breathing incorrectly when bench pressing) which cannot be rectified, I\u2019m worried perhaps I\u2019ve ruptured organs or weakened my abdominal wall or pushed stuff out in places it shouldn\u2019t be in? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being paranoid :/ I\u2019ve stopped weight lifting and just focusing on cardio but it still doesn\u2019t feel correct. I just wondered if any professionals can help me or is it all in my head ? I saw a paramedic too who did a thorough examination and he seems to think a lot of it may be anxiety related but also a possible old injury that needs to be managed. Thing is the ultra sound never picked up an injury? Or will sometimes ultra sounds not pick up older chronic type injuries? Any advice would be great thank you, I\u2019m really worrying about this as you can tell by my essay lol. ",

        "post_content": "Hello. First of all I'd like to apologize for my English, but its not my first language and i hope you will understand. Today, when I came back from school I really needed to pee, and I did so. After, my lower stomach started hurting really bad, I got really scared, I thought it might be period cramps, but they're never THAT bad - I barely walked back to my room and lied down. I felt like I'm about to pass out and puke, which fortunately didn't happen. After an hour when the pain didn't stop I decided to go and see a gynecologist, since I thought something might be wrong around that area. The doctor did an ultrasound, which didn't really show anything, except I found out there might be a cyst, but he's not sure since it's not proper and told me to come back tomorrow morning when my bladder is full, so we can repeat the procedure. After I came back home I decided to take a pill and go to sleep. When i woke up, my chest started hurting really bad, and since that it just keeps getting worse. Then it was just the stomach and lower belly pain, but then it also became shoulder pain, and that's where i got worried, so I went to the hospital. The doctor there wasn't really worried about me and just checked my heart rate and gave me some prescription pills, that don't seem to work as well. I am really not able to walk or move, It hurts when i try to breathe a little deep or roll to my side, I'm not even able to sleep, i dont know what to do to feel better anymore. Someone please help me know what it might be, I'm scared I won't be able to get up tomorrow and see the doctor again. ",

When I had my ultrasound, they scanned all my abdominal organs and found nothing. A ovarian cyst was suggested but they found no evidence of that. If nothing is found in your ultrasound, you could also ask for a urine test since the pain started after you urinated. If that is negative as well, maybe request a colonoscopy to see if it is a bowel problem since you have lower abdominal pain. Is your lower abdominal pain located on one side only or does it move about? In the meantime, try painkillers to help with the pain.",

Also if you are in need of stronger pain medication let them know as well, and your doctor too. It has become a nightmare to get proper pain treatment in the ER or from doctors today due to the whole fake crisis on pain meds. It is not pain meds that is the crisis it is illegal drugs. Tell them that their care is unacceptable and that you will not leave until they do the scans and all they can to fine out the reason for your pain. Cysts can cause alot of bad symptoms as well, do you have a history of ovarian cysts when you ovulate? While in the ER ask what specialist are on duty and ask to see the one who is closest to your symptoms, say a urologist or OB/GUN. Also tell them if you are having any kind of chest pain, they can do blood work to rule out some heart issues, no matter your age. Are you on the BC pill, did they check for blood clots in the lungs etc...If they do a ct scan as ct o have it done with contrast. If your doc appt isn't soon enough call the doc office and say it is an emergency and you need to see someone now. Today we must demand our care, be the squeaky wheel, docs see so many patients and if you are willing to leave they are willing to let you go. Just say No. Ask for more testing and tell them you are scared, it feels very bad etc.....not sure of your age but I hope this helps, fight for your rights as a patients, there is a patient bill of rights, read it. Good luck !!",

The longer you wait to resection it the worse it is, the muscles become weak and can herniate easily after resection. Also he used a netting inside that became infected and his stomach ruptured every 9 months and it was a horrendous thing to deal with. Blood and pus everywhere. So if you use any kind of inside netting make sure the company has exception feedback and is very good. The infections continued till the day he died. So my recommendation is resect as soon as humanly possible. ",

Its very uncomfortable at night and seems to also flare when ive lifted something or upon walking. I feel like it restricts my movements and sometimes feels like im carrying a heavy brick in my stomach. Its there everyday. My doctor believes its stress related however im not convinced. I was initially given ppi's but these made me worse. Ive tried Gaviscon also which doesnt help so dont believe its indigestion. Blood tests all fine. Anyone had similar problem?",

Stress is very hard on the gut and could cause things like gastritis which can only be seen on an endoscopy and not on blood tests. It may also be a stomach infection called h pylori. Go back to your doctor and ask about these conditions.",

Try healthier version, low in spices, also take probiotics from health shops or plain yogert with live culture. Drink more water. Keep a food diary and take multivitamins. That little redness in the stomach indicates a beginning of mild ulcer or soreness so it gives a plenty of reason to try and look after your gut. I hope I dont sound too mumsy.

                "comment_content": "I also have pain in the upper left abdomen, and this is going into 5 years now, It hit me suddenly in March of 2016 out of nowhere, never had anything like it before. It has a set pattern, it would hit in certain months and it has 3 phases. Months were Dec, March, June,Sept & Oct. Each one lasting 6-8 weeks. Beginning phase is bowel purging, chills, headache and neck pain, feeling very very unwell, and nausea,that increases in intensity , then going into phase 2-acute phase of severe upper left ab pain, into the mid spine and across the left ribs, it is now also going across the right ribs as well. The nausea is very intense but little throwing up, Pain is very severe, Eating is hard, any food seems to add pressure and adds to the severe pain, many days I eat nothing or drink ensure. Just try to stay hydrated. I feel very unwell, total exhaustion,shaking, chin chatters, not from cold or anxiety, brain dead/fog, feel almost autistic...in my own world.., hard to even carry on a conversation, at times my legs feel weak and shaking and it is hard to walk, Neurological symptoms. I never think I will survive the acute phase, I feel like I will die. The final stage, recovery is a real struggle, it is very, very slow and I feel very unwell, I dont feel like doing anything at all, just lay there watch TV or sleeping. For the first 4 1/2 years I would go into remission after each 6-8 week episode, and have a few weeks of feeling perfectly fine. Now I do get a bit better but never 100% any more. This has been for the last 6 months or so. I have been mainly home bound since Sept 2019. I have done endoscope, treated H. pylori, now gone, colonoscopy, CT scans with dye, ultra sounds.Been in the hospital several times for 6-10 days at a time with it in the past, but do all I can to treat it at home. The ER docs are idiots when it comes to any kind of pain. I am doing the full exome dna test now, awaiting those results, most docs think it is porphyria or med. fever at first, but so far both neg. I am as you can imagine very desperate for an answer, My case is now live on crowd med, case name is Xavier for anyone who is a doc/or has something like this... and may have some idea of what this is, please go to the site and read my details. thanks !!!",

The pain is intense, only pressure pushing lump in ...and arching myself backwards relieves it. location is just below rib cage ... starting about 1/3rd in from centreline and follows curve of rib cage for about 5\" towards my right side. Lasts several minutes, the lump feels hard ... certainly not soft. After it subsides and lump goes away, the area feels bruised if palpated, often for a couple of days .... but no bruising discoloration. My Dr referred me to hospital for Muscular Skeletal tests .... x-rays & ultrasound resulted in a nice report ruling out broken ribs, which I did not consider in first place. Nothing conclusive ... referring me back to my Dr. Today it got worse ... I was driving and it suddenly it happened, very painful and pretty difficult to deal with at speed, it happened several times ... this was without any reaching down or bending. Due to risk, I now need to get this looked into further ... any suggestions? Obvious first thought was hernia ... but seems unlikely place, plus the lump is not soft.",

However, almost every day in the mornings, I wake up with pretty severe lower stomach pain which sometimes moves to the pelvic and genital area also. The only thing that seems to calm it down is meals. After breakfast, the pain usually goes away. I am wondering if I am deficient in nutrients because of the low carb diet. If anyone can help, I would appreciate it. I have tried pepsid complete and gas-x, both of which don't work. Also, the pain only happens when walking. When I stand in one place or sit or lie down, there is no pain.",

Broccoli can cause gas, bread can cause bloating and cream can also irritate the gut. Try cutting out these foods to see if it makes a difference. There are many symptoms of IBS and they differ for everyone. The main ones are abdominal pain that moves about, nausea, changes in bowel habit such as diarrhoea or constipation or a mixture of both. Some experience bloating and gas. Some find certain foods trigger attacks. Stress and anxiety can bring the flare ups on too and can cause IBS. I had no trigger foods.",

I am a 69 years old female (full hysterectomy 14 months ago due to benign ovarian cysts), never have I had any gastric problems, heartburn, reflux, etc. I have been vegetarian for 40 years and have no other health problems. I intend going back to my GP soon who has already suggested IBS but the medication didn't help so I am would just like the view of an IBS sufferer as to what the pain feels like. Incidentally I am not constipated nor do I have diarrhoea though I have had some changes in area.",

However, antispasmodics and standard painkillers have helped with the pain. I had 24/7 IBS pain all at different levels of severity for three and a half months when it first started. I was very stressed because no one could diagnose me. If you have IBS, stress makes the pain worse. With IBS, you often have to try several antispasmodics to find one that suits you. My GP prescribed me an antispasmodic that made me worse. I had to find an OTC antispasmodic myself which was far better. On the upside, I haven't had a flare up in years because I am trying to reduce stress. However, this is only my experience of IBS; everyone is different.

I'd try a new doctor (gastroenterologist) and if they cant come up with anything maybe try some herbs or something like Mastic gum. Mastic gum kills bad bacteria in the gut and is pretty harmless. Take a probiotic with it if you wanted to give it a try. Do some research on your own about it. If your problem is unrelated to the sexual encounter then you need to look into food allergies/intolerances. Do you eat a lot of fast food? Gluten? Dairy? My daughter has IBS and if she eats the wrong thing shes puking with diarrhea. Her stomach then gets inflammed which presses on her bladder and causes frequent urination like you get. Not saying you have IBS but Id pay attention to what your eating/ food diary. Hope this helps!",

        "post_content": "Hello, I am a 27 years old male. My pain started April 2018 (2 years ago). The pain comes when i have a bowel movement especially if my stools are a bit on the watery side. The pain is localised and is a an extreme burning pain that can last for hours after any BM. The pain started suddenly and i recall using glycerin suppositories due to constipation before the pain started. In the past two years I have done an MRI, MR Defecography( it showed a bit of paradoxical contractions), Anal manometry, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and anoscopy and biopsies were taken. There is still no explanation. I saw an anorectal surgeon last year and he said I had fissures so I underwent a Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy. The pain only decreases a bit faster after the BM but its still bad. I went back to my anorectal surgeon and then he started speculating that I had Solitary Rectal Ulcer syndrome ( I have no rectal bleeding or mucus discharge) and he told me to do biofeedback which I did and had very little effect on me. He suggested Ulcer excision but I saw 3 other doctors that they saw no ulcer or anything else but just internal hemmorhoids. This has taken a mental toll on me as I live with this pain every day with no diagnosis. It is also worth noting that when ever I did enemas for colonoscopy preparations that salinity made my pain so intense that I had to take pain killers. As if pouring alcohol on a wound. I will attach a picture to point where the pain is (highlighted in green) ![image](https://patient.azureedge.net/forums/images/upload-sm/1299705-637191966188786148.jpg) and I hope I can get an answer.

But still waiting stool sample test . But the bloods returned with high CRP of 20 ngL which 5 is the max . My folate is 3.9 and b12 is 275 which both on the very lower end. Is this low enough to feel so dizzy and unwell? I am also concerned about my Crp why is it so high?! can it be because i had a cold on the day?! or maybe my stomach infection! or worse!? any one similar experience ?",

Which foods or activites have you found calm it down? For example if dairy helps like yogurt or milk, it may be acidity level and at your age I doubt it would be a chronic problem so taking Tums for a couple of days will fix that up or even some pepto. Depending on your periods your doctor may put you on birth control. I had very irregular periods at your age with terrible cramps and other stomach problems. My doctor put me on birth control for about 3 months if I remember correctly and it helped a lot with both. Viruses tend to run their course but things like crackers and ginger ale help.",

        "post_content": "Hi! I am an 56 year old Male and I have been having issues with a burning stomach for the past 3 years. I had an endoscopy done 3 years ago and it showed my stomach was inflamed, but nothing else showed up. I then had a colonoscopy done 2 years ago and one polyp was found and removed. The polyp was not precancerous. Since I had gallstones, the dr suggested that my gallbladder may be the cause so I had it removed 4 weeks ago. After the gallbladder removal, I had no stomach issues until yesterday when the burning returned. I also have some mild nausea and feel lightheaded. The burning pain is mostly on both sides and also the upper abdomen. Sometime I feel it around my belly button. I also experience some bloating at times. Sometimes I have very mild chills and some shaking. Pressing with my hand on the pain spot seems to relieve it somewhat. No bloody stools, except when my hemorrhoids are painful and irritated. Any ideas what my next steps should be? ",

I have experienced pain around the belly button and bloating, mine is IBS though and have recently tried kefir yoghurt drinks which have really helped my symptoms. I am not usually good with lactose but this doesn't seem to be so much of a problem with me. Are you taking anything like ppi tablets for the inflammation?",

It used to be textbook brown and now it is a lighter brown. Sometimes undigested food bits when the stool is loose. In the last few months I woke up like two times with acid reflux in my throat Physical exam that doctor did of my abdomen was normal no pain when they pushed and no lumps Tests they have run already: Upper endoscopy: H Pylori negative, minor reflux, mild inflammation, nothing major Ultrasound: clear Blood tests: Liapase normal, amylase normal, comprehensive blood panel normal (with the liver blood tests), CBC/Diff blood panel normal, an extra liver enzyme test called L GGT blood test normal, L Celiac Ab blood panel normal no celiac, TSH3 blood test for thyroid normal. Urine test: normal Fecal tests: Pancreatic Elastase stool normal, 4 different test for parasites infections: Cryptosporidium; Stool culture for Sal, Shig, Campy, and Shiga; stool ova and parasite exam; and stool C difficile toxins A+B, EIA all negative On Tuesday of this week they are doing colonoscopy and while there they will sample tissue for microscopic colitis. Any thoughts on what this could be? I just want thoughts based on your own experiences I appreciate that no one can diagnose me from a distance. What other tests would you request?",

I have my colonoscopy tomorrow so if i find out anything useful I will share. Because we have some similar symptoms, if they find something tomorrow, it may help you to know which test to try next...Maybe hopefully save you some time and/or misery. All the best, David",

Thank you for your help as well! It is nice to talk to someone who is going through something similar.

I do not eat close to bedtime after I had reflux a couple of times. I drank more when I was college aged, but that was a long time ago lol Since my stools were loose I started eating more bananas, toast, oatmeal, stuff like that...The stools on this new softer diet have me switching between regular consistency and loose stools. They are always light brown now. Which worries me. I don't know if it is because I eat a banana every day now and i really didn't before or what...This color change is weird to me though... To be honest since all this has started I have been afraid to eat a little. I try to eat small portions and not push it. Did you see what they had tested me for so far? Tomorrow they do colonoscopy so I should have a little more information. Can you think of any tests you would recommend? Do my symptoms sound like they match any condition? ",

                "comment_content": "Hey Zeeena. Im 38 years old...I use to have sugar drops all the time and that's what it sounds like to me. I could be wrong but sounds alot like what I had. It was especially bad around hormone changes and menstrual cycles. Id first get a little headache, feel aggravated, then I'd start shaking, and then I'd have to eat something to shoot my sugar back up. Even got to the point where id start sweating and crying. Then I'd want to eat EVERYTHING! Cinnamon levels out blood sugar. I'd eat some everyday to see if it helped. Funny thing is I went to the doctor too to rule out diabetes and they tried to put me on antidepressants when my test came back normal!! I told him absolutely not!! Anyway, I finally had to do away with most the sugar in my life..not all but most. Heres why..when you eat sugar, bread, pasta, candy etc..it shoots your sugar way too high and drops you super low..too low. If you do eat sugar make sure you eat it with a protein. Never by itself. So I try to stick to a paleo diet to keep my blood sugar level. I did keto diet too and never had 1 sugar drop. Another thing it could be is thyroid. I'd get blood work to check it out. Hope this helped! ",

Find alternatives and see if things change. Doctors are clueless so do your own research. Careful with sweeteners as some are not good. Check labels as there seems to be sugar in EVERYTHING! If nothing changes then stop dairy. It's a process of elimination. Gluten next! Keep an eye on your fruit intake. Bananas OK. I react badly to all berries! Hope that helps Lea x ",

You should feel a difference within 2-3 weeks and a lot better by 6 weeks....if it is the low B12 that is causing your symptoms. I my opinion i am sure it is now i have seen your B12 levels.....continue taking them as i said you can't overdose on B12. Your B12 gets low because of diet, you get B12 from dairy, meat, cheese, eggs. That's why vegetarians have low B12 so they take supplements as they do not eat B12 foods such as dairy and meat in their diet.....keep us posted..let us know how your getting on with the B12 and Vit D supplements....give it a little while for your body to absorb it.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",

First symptom was stomach pain and digestive issues..so lets start there. Do you have normal bowel movements? I'd definitely watch everything I put in my mouth and do a food diary. Look up elimination diet. Not going to hurt if you get off gluten and dairy for 2 weeks and then add them back into your diet one at a time to see if they bother you. No fast food. No raw food like salad. I'd stick with a little meat, cooked veggies, and potatoes. Chicken broth, soups. See a doctor about this though to rule things out. One day at a time ! Prayers",

But no matter how hungry I am within a few bites I\u2019m totally full. I\u2019ve been bloated and can\u2019t remember the last time I went to the loo properly (tmi sorry!). I have IBS so this is very unusual, and I\u2019ve not changed eating habits. Then today I\u2019ve had trouble swallowing. It takes forever for food to get down. Any advice would be appreciated!

The side stomach pain is so intense that it takes a lot of effort to move but when I do the pain quickly fades. This stabbing sensation only happens when I lay on my left side. Last night the pain woke me up at 3 am and forced me to race to the bathroom. Nowadays I don't have a movement for a few days in a row, and then I'm very suddenly overcome with the urge to go, and when I do it's diarrhea.",

I'm trying to figure out how to stop these issues cause it makes my job really hard when I'm driving and have nausia and diarrhea. it's not like I can stop and run to the bathroom lol",

Sleep Apnea sufferers wake several times at night because they are unable to breathe in sufficient oxygen and the CPAP machine enables them to have a good nights sleep and enables them wake up refreshed....without the machine they feel as if they have had no sleep at all...

        "post_content": "Hi all. I'm posting this in the hope that someone can relate and offer some sort of help or advice as this has gone on far too long! I'm a 25 year old female and I've had spells of almost constant nausea since I was around 10 years old. When I was younger it got to the point where I would just not eat (not helpful!) for fear of being sick, as I've grown up I've almost accepted that feeling sick is a part of my life now and I try to carry on/eat as normal unless I have a particularly bad \"flare up\". However I really shouldn't have to live like this! When I first complained of it my parents took me to the doctors numerous times and at a very young age, after complaining the nauseous feeling was at the back of my throat, I was told I had reflux and given lansaprozole. When it didn't work whatsoever my dose was doubled until my mother actually complained that I was being given such a high dosage at a young age! After this I just tried to put up with it. My final year at high school I was mostly off school feeling unwell! I struggled through but by the time I got to university I was fed up. I went back to the docs and this time was diagnosed with IBS and prescribed mebeverine. The most this did for me was reduce the gas and bloating that came with my upset stomachs but after a month of taking it it actually gave me nausea EVERY single day til I stopped it! In recent years after finally realising how much this has been ruling my life, along with realising how bad my symptoms can get - nausea, upset stomach, dizziness, fatigue, headaches etc and sometimes feeling sick to the point of thinking I'm going to be physically sick, only to burp! I've finally gone to the docs several more times. I've tried domperidone which helped a little but I was eventually taken off it as I still felt unwell, I tried omeprazole (mostly to please docs as they still insist its reflux) and was recently given erythromycin which I never took after a consultant was horrified I'd been prescribed it in the first place. I've had a endoscopy which revealed I have a hiatus hernia (my dad has one too so must be hereditary) however I very very rarely get heartburn or any kind of reflux and my symptoms are not related! It also revealed an inflamed stomach lining but nothing else. I've also had a stomach emptying test which came back normal, I've been tested for helicobacter pylori NUMEROUS times over the 15 years and most recently I've had an ultrasound scan of my liver and gallbladder. I was referred to a consultant in the past few months who believes my symptoms are not stomach related, hence liver etc tests! I'm still awaiting blood tests but no word yet. Im meant to get referred to a G.I but again no word yet. The most recent tests have been over a span of one year so it's a terribly slow process! I have infact just been told my next appointment with the consult is 7 months from now which is frankly ridiculous. Hence I've come here! I would greatly appreciate any help with this as its starting to take over my life! I've had years with no nausea at all but this has been over a year now with almost constant nausea. I've also been tested for celiac disease which came back negative, I've bizarrely never had stools tested despite upset stomachs and I've tried a lacto-free diet for two weeks which made no difference! I additionally tried to eat 100% healthily/no processed foods etc for two weeks which equally made no difference, still chronic nausea and fatigue! Any suggestions on what this could be would be massively appreciated!",

Unfortunately, at his age they just want to write him off and say his body is deteriorating. There must be someone in this world who could come up with a diagnosis for people with these symptoms. I know how frustrated I am not being able to get any help for him. I wish I had an asnser for you, you are not alone in this type of torment.",

Ever since I was diagnosed with a hernia my doc was writing all my symptoms off as that, but you don't get exhaustion, dizziness, upset stomachs and headaches from a hernia. My doctor even said my hernia was creating a gas build up that threw off my whole system and maybe I should try some multivitamins to help with the fatigue as the hernia meant I wasn't absorbing enough nutrients! I told the hospital consultant this he was horrified and told me it was not related. Needless to say I've switched my doctor since! I think the key is probably persistence! It does take a while though unfortunately as my endoscopy was approximately a year ago now and I'm still no closer to answers! I'd just keep at them! Good luck! ",

I&#39;ve felt unwell for so long that I dread feeling unwell so much that I often feel unwell as a result! Sometimes I&#39;ll have a panic attack and I&#39;ll feel sick and as I dread feeling sick I now panic about having a panic attack, absolute nightmare.</p><p>I am learning however to control these feelings and I&#39;ve had a break from work this past week which has allowed me to concentrate on controlling my worrying and I&#39;ve bought a book called &quot;Cure your emetaphobia and thrive&quot; which may or may not help you - it depends how much being nauseous is worrying you! I&#39;ve felt a lot better this week though and I&#39;ve also cut out lactose which has helped a bit with bloating. I definitely notice myself feeling worse when I&#39;m stressed though so it may be worth trying to relax yourself.&#160;</p><p></p><p>It sounds like you&#39;ve had all the same tests as me (I had an MRI instead of a CT, I&#39;ve also had surgery for endometriosis which I hoped would help but it didn&#39;t!) so at least we can reassure ourselves that it&#39;s definitely nothing serious if it&#39;s all come back normal.&#160;</p><p></p><p>Definitely get the endoscope, they are awful but I learned I had a hiatus hernia which may contribute to my symptoms, I&#39;m hoping I can get surgery for this one day.</p><p></p><p>You should also give the FODMAP diet a go and cut out everything which may upset your stomach. I&#39;ve not tried it yet but I intend to soon.</p><p></p><p>I know exactly what you&#39;re going through though so I really hope you feel better soon!! It&#39;s tough when you have a long stretch of no good days but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a good day soon! :) x</p>",

I&#39;m 17 years old and I first time I remember starting to get noticeable constant diarrhoea, stomach pain and nausea is around 2015 in June. I was diagnosed with IBS due to anxiety which i still have. However I&#39;ve always been a picky eater ever since I can remember, I wouldn&#39;t eat a lot of things. I have had a blood test and that&#39;s it though but I don&#39;t know what else it could be since I&#39;ve had it for so long I don&#39;t want to bother further complicating things by going to the doctor again &amp; again, it&#39;s just annoying! I tried buscopan and colpedmin and it did nothing! I haven&#39;t gone to the doctor since because I&#39;ve just been so busy. I actually realised my anxiety is due to the fact I take life too seriously in the summer this year during my holiday and throughout a festival and I was free from IBS for like a month! Then when college started it came back &amp; im confused as to what it is because I already know the root cause of my anxiety, why did it come back?? I just get anxiety for no reason whatsoever and it&#39;s frustrating me so much. I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not alone.&#160;</p>",

My first tests were for helicobacter pylori (negative), celiac disease (also negative) and general things like thyroid function, again normal.</p><p></p><p>If you&#39;ve not had the helicobacter pylori test definitely ask for it, it&#39;s curable with antibiotics. Wish I had had that!!&#160;</p><p></p><p>Definitely don&#39;t be fobbed off with the IBS thing though, I was told that years ago and put on Mebeverine. It reduced gassiness/bloating but by the time I was on my 2nd month prescription it started making me feel sick everyday so I stopped it. To me this makes me think there must be SOMETHING wrong with me but nothing anyone has found yet.</p><p></p><p>Just keep going back to the docs. It does sound like there might be a link with your anxiety (I get it too, when I&#39;m really stressed I feel awful) and maybe going back to college is marginally more stressful than normal life? You might not be consciously thinking of it but there might be an underlying stress (exams etc?).</p><p>If you&#39;re away from home for college it might be something as simple as eating different food, sleeping different hours, doing different things.</p><p>When I was at uni I remember a good 2-3 years where I felt normal 80-90% of the time. In my 4th year I was quite ill round exam time but that was definitely stress. As I&#39;ve got older though I just always seem to feel unwell.</p><p></p><p>I hope you find a solution soon. Definitely go back to the doc for more tests though if you&#39;re not satisfied! :)&#160;</p><p>Hope that helps!!&#160;</p>",

No previous medical conditions, no medications, no conditions. It started on Monday with a super weird feeling in my stomach that comes and goes. Almost like the feeling that anxiety can give you, where your stomach feels unsettled and kinda icy. Definitely do not have anxiety about anything right now though. No pain really, just uncomfortable. My stomach was rumbling and every so often I could feel it moving, so I assumed it was gas. That continued until Thursday, when I caved and got some Pepto Biysmol which helped temporarily. I'm also having trouble going to the bathroom. I took a laxative on Tuesday and was able to go, but it didn't make my stomach feel better. I took another one tonight and it helped, but now my stomach is again moving around. It's like a rolling or dropping sensation in my stomach that I attribute to gas. Still having trouble going to the bathroom and (TMI) when I do go it's kinda a weird consistency. Not diarrhea but not solid either, and pretty hard to go. Any ideas? Edit: Just remembered something else. On Thursday, I was laying down on my couch then all of the sudden I could feel my stomach moving with my pulse (or I'm pretty sure it was my pulse since it was rhythmic). I've never felt something so bizarre. It was a pretty intense and powerful feeling and when I lifted up my shirt to look my whole stomach was moving with it. I'm overweight and don't have a flat stomach. It wasn't in my chest either, it was like center stomach area.",

I got sick halfway through with a stomach bug and nothing I took worked on it, i have a throwing up phobia so it frightened me. i had violent nausea, and like waves of radiating illness, ive never had that with other bugs and stuff and once I got off Lexapro and weened off, I felt better. Sadly, My Doctor suggsted I go on Prozac, and I am terrified again I will have the same issues. I have family yelling at me about suffering through it for later, but I have been through so much for years and I am not even depressed, he suggested it because I take Ativan and he said it would make it work better. Any thoughts on if Lexapro is the same as Prozac? Or if its different on the stomach at all?",

These medications can actually cause anxiety and depression. Doctors make money from anti depressants. Even if Wellbutrin SR doesn't cause nausea for one person, doesn't mean it won't affect you. One is as bad as the other as far as I am concerned. ",

Mine never really healed so to speak,just kept it at bay for some time. The esomaprozal\u200b did help though. After that didnt help, that is when I was put onto Nexium. I had the hernia for 9 years, some hernias dont bother people that much and are managable with medicine. Hope yours feels better soon. :)",

You have to give it time to heal...it wont happen overnight. Are you taking probiotic to replace the good bacteria the HP damaged. Probiotics come in the form of natural yogurt (Onken, Activia) and others. Choose the ones with live good bacteria like plain greek yogurts also mix with antioxodant fruits such as blueberries and grapes. You can also get probiotics in tablet form from health shop. Be kind to your tum and don't put to much spicey or heavy food into it. Just eat salads, chicken, fish, omelettes and veggies and fruit not citrus for the time being. Thus giving your stomach lining time to heal...you prob know all this but mentioned incase not...hope this helps......best wishes...",

                        "comment_content": "Hi Kevin Gastritis is no fun. Slightly confused at your response to some of the observations. \" Presumably after the H.Pylori\" !!!!! Did the Endoscopy show H.Pylori or not ? And did you have a breath test or a stool test before that. At least it sounds as though the Endoscopy showed no worse. Do I take it that you did not take esomeprazole before the Endoscopy because this would have given a false result. Esomeprazole is one of a number of drugs called Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs). There are a number with almost similar constituents. Nexium is another as is Omeprazole ( surprising you did not get on with this as it's as near as Esomeprazole as makes no difference). They all take just a little while to become most effective. PPIs form part of the three drug therapy for H. Pylori though they will not kill the H.pylori on their own Somebody said quite correctly that PPIs taken long term can have very serious side effects. But the anti H.Pylori therapy only takes two weeks and it is often followed by a further two weeks with the PPI on its own. So you are very unlikely to get real problems from that. So the observation that it might take a year to rid the stomach of H.Pylori is a bit way out. Somebody mentioned probiotics including Yoghurt, Excellent advice ! If you don't get on with PPIs, there are a group of drugs called H2 Receptor Inhibitors which started effective treatment for H. pylori. You may have heard of them. They include Zantac, Cimetidine etc. They have, in the main, been superceded by PPis. But they are slightly quicker in counteracting acidity than PPIs and probably don't have such severe effects if taken long term. Best wishes",

Then it went worse than ever stomach ache constantly I was never asked by my GP to return to see if it had cleared up. So kept going back every week and then they got sick of me and booked a endoscapy and biopsy at a private hospital. Went to see the consultant he said they would do it and tell me the results there and then. Fine I thought so had the camera and biopsy. Consultant told me as soon as they had done it that there was nothing nasty just inflammation of the stomach lining don't worry. Then I got a letter as I left the hospital see you in 6 week?? So I was confused at this point so I saw the consultant on the way out and asked him. He assured me again not to worry and there was nothing going on just inflammation presumably from the hpylori. I was confused at this point so rang his secretary and she said the reason for the 6 week was he was in annual leave? I was getting more concerned really because I hadn't got an answer as to the cause of this. I phoned his secretery a few times. She rang me and told me that when they get the results of the biopsy she will ring me. She rang me and said it came back nothing to worry about and he is happy to see me in 6 week but carry on taking the ppi. Now I am over the moon that there is nothing nasty there but feel like I have been left in the dark a bit. Everyone keeps telling me if there was something underlining going on he would have told me and got me in sooner this was a long reply ha ha ",

                        "comment_content": "Hi Kevin Your GP was sadly at fault. After the triple therapy you must have an H.Pylori test to see whether there has been eradication. Sometimes it doesn't but a change in the therapy does However, they must have tested for H.p when you had your Endoscopy. The reason why they have asked you to go back is that you have probably had three biopsies during your Endoscopy. Just to make sure that there is not some other underlaying problem. These will take a little time for the Lab to examine. I take it that you had your therapy for a week and hopefully he gave you the Gold Standard therapy of a PPI eg Esomeprazole, plus two antibiotics - Clarythromicine, and Amoxcicillin. It woud then be followed by the PPI on its own for a further two weeks just to give the stomach a chance to heal from Gastritis having got rid of the H.pyloris. Six weeks on a PPI is not likely to do you any harm. Don't take them in the long term (I could tell you why). If for any reason you need to take an acid inhibiter over a long period (and you really shouldn't), I would turn to the H2 Receptor Blockers which are slightly less effective than PPIs but have a lesser history of long term difficulties. These are Zantac, Ranitidine, Cemetedine and a few others. But try to relax. I'm sure the biopsies will turn out OK. Your Consultant will advise you of the results and whilst you are with him just make sure that they found you totally clear when they did the Endoscopy. You will of course ask him what he thinks is giving you continuing problems after eradication and OK biopsies. Best wishes ",

This hormone inhibits and regulates the concentration of Gastric Acid. For a reason which is not yet known to medical science H pylori has the capability of reducing the effectiveness of Somatostatin. In addition some people have genetically more acid producing cells than others. It is the resultant concentration of acidity (or even strangely the lack of acid in some cases) which attack the mucous lining of the stomach or duodenum and can cause ulceration. It is true that a higher level of H pylori has been found round the periphery of such ulcerations.",

Sufficent to say that both of us may have had a lifetime dealing with Gastric issues - and no doubt, both of us have read more Scientific papers on the subject than we care to remember. I really really don't want to be rude but I believe that the question of H.pylori having a burrowing capability is a little out of date. I was also slightly surprised when you mentioned red fruits in terms of diet and is my memory at fault when I think you also mentioned red wine as another source of antioxidants. I have never seen any scientific evidence that antioxidants are beneficial in Gastric situations. Fruit and fruit drinks should be avoided during Gastric Therapy - far bettter to take on board loads of steamed and various green vegetables. And alcohol has a damaging effect on inflamed mucous lining. As you know smoking is even far worse and should be an absolute no no for those with Gastric issues. Many thanks for your interesting contribution. Nice to be communicating with a very knowlegeable person. Kindest regards ",

My friend still had symptoms and went back to her gp and HP was detected again...so now she has regular checks..she has changed her diet and lifestyle and is feeling ok...although she has no idea if the HP has been completely eradicated until her next check. I always say that if people go to their gp with HP symptoms the gp should do stool or breath test first before they send patients for endoscopies and ultrasounds etc when they sometimes have yo wait months for the appointment and the HP is flourishing during all that time and give prescriptions that do not help whatsoever thus saving time and starting AB's a.s.a.p and also saving time and money for the NHS...the NHS make work for themselves and cost themselves money......best wishes.",

When a patient presents with a history indicating H.

In these circumstances GPs request an urgent Endoscopy. Hospitals are time limited by the NHS when such an urgent appointment is requested. In my experience these appointments are made within a fortnight. ",

But I want to warn you that taking ppi does come with side effects. It decreases stomach acid andif taken for prolonged time you can cause hypochlohdria and have difficulty in digesting food and absorbing it. You didnt mention which antibiotics you take for the helicobacter pylori. This bacteria has to be treated with a medicine not with stomach acid blocker. I came acrosss a doctor on youtube who made a video that bismuth and L-glutamine products speed the healing of stomach inflammaton and bismuth healing helicobacter pylori because of their substance. Maybe you can try and add bismuth to your terapy against the bacteria.",

Its not all day, but its usually when I first wake up in the morning and then it may occur randomly throughout the day. It gets worse with eating. I assume its from throat irritation. It goes away after I get up the very small amount of congestion. Anyone else experience this?",

I blame a massive amount of stress that I have endured for a very long time. The PPIs made me feel ill so I stopped taking them. My pain is more intermittent but is always there at some time of day. I'm due an abdo scan next week. I've been told that an abdominal scan consists of kidneys, liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Sounds good that your bloods came back all normal. You sound as though you are doing what I would imagine most of us posting on here do and that's Google our symptoms and scare ourselves stupid! I do it all the time, just can't help it. Why don't you book an appointment with your GP for as soon as possible, tell the Dr what you think it could be and let the GP put your mind at rest. I think this is the only way you will get true peace of mind. As far as your pain goes, you might find it eases a bit once you are more relaxed. i wish you all the best. xx",

I am eating a very bland diet in the hope that it will eventually heal. Its a good idea to nor eat certain acidic foods such as tomatoes and citrus fruits which may aggravate it. Keeping a food diary to pinpoint triggers is also useful as different people respond differently to different foods. Good luck",

Maybe you need the dose of your PPI adjusting or even a change of PPI - some people seem to do better on one over another. I am on a very high does of Omeprazole which seems to work most of the time but then out of the blue I have a flare up and I'm back to square one. Talk about 3 steps forward, 2 steps back. I follow for the most part a very bland diet of soups and complan with steamed fish and very soft vegetables which seems to help but as soon as I feel a little better I eat something different and everything flares up again. For some people it can be very nasty and take a long time to clear up. There are also some natural remedies which may help. Also a malfunctioning gallbladder can cause a lot of the same symptoms without their being any stones present. A Hida scan will tell you how well the gallbladder is actually working - mine was working at only 8% so it had to be removed earlier this year - there were no stones present though and my ultrasound was clear and this greatly delayed my diagnosis.",

I then started feeling worse and 2 weeks I had full blown gastritis. Scope confirmed no ulcer. So I went off the ppi and started zantac with bad side effects. So the specialist put me back on ppi nexium and things started to look better with brats diet. But then it&#39;s slowly getting worse each day. I was reading that ppi drugs can in some causes cause gastritis. So you keep taking the ppi to keep from getting an ulcer but slowly it just gets worse. I feel like I&#39;m on a rollercoaster of better days and bad days. Taking the ppi Capsule apart and lessening the dose does sound like a good way to taper off but fearing a major gastritis attack. Carafate also keeps me awake all night. I get 2-4 hrs each night. </p>",

Two weeks into taking it, I got intense stomach pain radiating into the back, never had such pain before. stopped taking medication, pain got more tolerable but never went. GP said pain was probably coincidental to cause the pain and put me on another PPI. Again, after about two weeks, same intense pain, stopped medication. Rnitidine did not help much either. Same thing after trying a third type of PPI. Pain also made me feel nauseous plus I got too loose stools making me lose too much weight. MRI was normal. Endoscopy of stomach showed two benign polyps and gastritis, probably medication-induced so the consultant said initially assuming I regularly take aspirin or ibuprofen which I did not. He then said, probably stress-related which I find hard to accept as well given the low stress level I have. I cannot help thinking the PPIs caused it. Since then, I still get flare ups of this stomach/back pain (luckily not as intense anymore) mainly long after eating/empty stomach. Feels like my gastritis has never really cleared up despite all the careful eating. Need to see the doctors again.",

In the case of IBS, the symptoms often cause stress and anxiety, especially if it takes a long time to diagnose. Have you tried a food diary to see if food is the problem? Have you noticed if these symptoms occur after a stressful incident? I had similar symptoms for two weeks: bowel habit change with constipation and loose stools, nausea and shifting abdominal pain which radiated to my lower back. I never lost my appetite After multiple negative tests, IBS was diagnosed. It took three and a half months to get answers. The seemingly hopeless wait caused me terrible health anxiety. I had six months of constant stress prior to the onset of symptoms. I saw my doctor when my symptoms were no better after two weeks. See your doctor since you have had symptoms for two weeks and ask about IBS.",

I have a hiatal hernia and was prescribed pantroprazole for heartburn(40 mg) been on it for two years and started off on lower dose. I'm used to having diarrhea a lot but last September I started to have constant diarrhea and started to lose weight. as weeks went on the diarrhea became constant and i also started feeling nauseous and sometimes vomiting. I called my GI in October but he couldn't see me until january 2020. By January I have lost 37 lbs and have little appetite and when i do eat I fill up quickly. I've always been anemic but I'm extremely fatigued and have a low grade fever. went off pantroprazole for pylori test and started having worst heartburn and belching episodes. I tested negative for pylori and had an abdominal CT scan which didn't show anything but fatty liver. had endo and colonoscopy over a year ago (2018) which showed inflammation in colon but no cancer. switched to new GI because old one saw me in January and couldn't see me again until MAY. I cant keep losing weight like this and not know what's wrong. and seems like no one has a.clue and they dismissed my cancer worries since I had tests in 2018 that didn't show anything. but cant cancer grow in over a year? I'm really worried and dont know what to do. has anyone had these symptoms before and if so what was it? am I overreacting? ",

        "post_content": "For a few years now, I been having flare ups of lower left side pain, sometimes they hurt really bad in the past, sometimes it feels like spasms, air moving from the front of my stomach down to my backside. I had various blood test and urine test last 2017, it was normal. in 2018 I saw blood in stool and had the stool test then was reffered to see a gastroenterologist. He thought it was probably IBS or a condition like colitis. My appointments kept being moved, they took long, was having an emotional breakdown due to personal problems and things just happened that made me have to cancel the appointment, which now I maybe shouldn't have done. Last year I was fine, I thought, whatever it was, it's gone now. I probably had the occasional cramps in my lower left side, but nothing as bad as before, or notice often. This year it has started again, but really mild and just there lke a painless sensation. Occasional spasms, bloating or trapped air feeling, but nothing that's preventing me from doing anything. I don't drink much water before going to bed, because sleeping on my right gives me bad pain on my lower left side that goes away after urinating. I cut down on dairy again and less fried foods. Running, cycling and being active helps relieve it. I still got the tablets my gp gave to me for IBS, it helps a little. Even if the symotoms are mild, and and almost not there all the time and might go again, I'm really unsure if I would be too much of a bother going to ask my GP for a re-referral? Waiting times on the NHS take up to 18 weeks, sometimes more than that. Which has put me off really ...and made me regret cancelling it especially when it comes back. I saw on the internet that a hospital one hour from here and closer than the last one has a gastro doctor, would a gp refer to any hospital or does it have to be the one they choose? ",

This may be the reason he is looking at other tests to give you a definitive answer since these other tests are clear. This is normal practice for a doctor. If your doctor is unsure, other tests are done. Your doctor being unsure, is not a reason to worry. It is better for your doctor to keep his options open rather than to decide on one condition without checking on other things first. It sounds like your doctor is being thorough which is reassuring. Abdominal pain has many causes and as such can be difficult to diagnose. It took three and a half months to get a diagnosis for my abdominal pain which was generalised and moved about which made it hard to pinpoint especially after many inconclusive and negative tests. I had multiple visits to several doctors before IBS was identified.",

The idea you have in your head about it being Pancreatic Cancer is unfounded. If your doctor suspected that he/she would have done blood tests on your pancreatic enzymes. That is the first port of call if PC is suspected. Trust me on that because my partner had PC. You are far too young to have PC and there is no way you are in late stages of PC because you wouldn't have the strength and be far too ill to even write your post on the forum. Stop stressing because this will make your symptoms far worse. Wait for your Ultrasound Scan which is not invasive and will not be stressful. Wait for the result and take it from there. In the meantime if you are managing to eat check what you are eating and drinking as much of the time certain foods or drinks can be the culprit....and see if and when you get the pain...",

Over the past month i have made a conscious effort to try and not worry about it, i have been taking probiotics and inulin and that seems to help me. My symptoms have definitely got better since relaxing. I would go and get the ultrasound just for peace of mind but how you feel sounds awfully similar to how i was feeling and alot of mine i do believe is stress and anxiety related.

The hospital said that I didn't need any further treatment and they didn't take a biopsy of any of the polyps. I assume this is because they didn't feel they are any threat but I don't know much about them so wondered if anyone else has had these. I was also surprised that they didn't recommend that I reduce my dose of lansoprazole. I'm on 45 mg per day. I was on 60mg but reduced it slightly on instruction from the Consultant when I saw him in outpatients before the endoscopy 2 months ago. I'm thinking of trying to reduce the dose though because if it's causing these polyps presumably just because they aren't an issue now doesn't mean they won't be in the future and I certainly don't want any more.",

The time before was even worse. A corridor chat with someone who was walking away from me whilst they were explaining the outcome and I went away unclear about what they'd said and had to go and see my GP for some facts. In terms of the tablets I can't go cold turkey unfortunately - have tried before and results were not pleasant. That's why they sent me for the scope I think as I've been on them 4 years. I've managed to halve the dose over 3 months with diet changes so I'm hoping if I do the rest gradually this will continue to work.",

I merely brushed it off until I began to have earaches on the same side and both became extremely painful, to the point that I could barely eat, drink, or even swallow at all without agony. Since I have recently moved and have no GP at the moment, I went to a local urgent care and the doctor felt of my neck for swollen lymph nodes, which he did find one(on the left side of course), and checked my throat and ears. He said nothing about my ears, but only that he suspected I had pharyngitis and gave me a prescription of amoxicillin and to come back in a few days if nothing had changed. I plan on doing as recommended, but I'm very worried about possible throat cancer, and I'm aware that throat cancer is too vague a term to use correctly. Recently my girlfriend was diagnosed with HPV, and since she had her pap smear completed before we were active and it.was clear, which leads me to believe I'm possibly carrying HPV and I'm aware of the HPV- linked cancers on the rise. I'm not sure what to do next other than see a family doctor if the symptoms keep up. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated. ",

They also found raised bumps on the back of my tongue and in my throat, which really concerns me, but now just waiting for the appointment, which of course is the hardest part. I never smoked hardly in the past and never drank, although I grew up around second hand smoke. I still worry about being an HPV carrier, but from what I've been told, theres no real way to tell. I guess I'll give another update once I find out what the ENT finds and tells me.",

When she has an attack like this with pain, diarrhea, mucus, etc I go for the metamucil or if the sugar/artificial sweetners hurt (they do my daughter) I buy plain psyllium husk from Amazon. This will slow down your digestive system. Eat rice if you can handle it and if not get some chicken broth until you can get to doctor. I know everybody is different but I can tell you what helps my daughter. She has IBS and she has those same symptoms so it possibly could help (not saying you have IBS, I'm not a doctor \ud83d\ude09). She eats rice before every meal and NEVER eats salad, fruit, anything really on an empty stomach. She eats a gluten free and dairy free diet. We stay away from sugar. Have some mint tea if you can handle it. Mint calms the gut. She eats a lot of gluten free bagels. Bread bulks up her stool or else she'll have diarrhea again.. Gluten free breads. Meats and veggies. lots of chicken bone broth. When she heals a little from an attack (I'd say a couple of months) fish oils with peppermint which I get from Target have helped a lot with the inflammation and also collagen powder. She has lots of anxiety too that comes along with IBS so she takes lots of baths to chill out. Hope doctors can help! Prayers for you! Hang in there! ",

It also radiates to my back and sometimes in my rib cage. I wouldn't say it was pain, just very uncomfortable and sometimes sore. I also feel extremely bloated all day, from the minute I wake up. Im on Omeprazole as the doctor seems to think this would cure it, even though I have been on them for what seems like an eternity! I stopped taking them for a few days as I wondered if they were doing more harm than good but I ended up with extreme Acid Reflux, to the point where I could have cried it was so painful! I'm back on them now and the acid has gone but still got the soreness and discomfort. I had bloods done, all clear. I'm getting so down now, just want this to go away. Can anyone relate? Wendy xx",

Lasagne is made with raw mince and cheese and cooked thoroughly and is perfectly safe. It's not the mixing of foods that's the problem; it's a question of the ingredients being fresh and cooked properly. As long as the meat didn't smell, didn't taste strange, and you washed your hands before and after handling the meat, you should be fine. It sounds more like a virus which is common during winter. There are a few going around. I know of a few people who have had stomach viruses. There is also the possibility that you had an intolerance to what you ate. I think most people here will tell you the same thing regarding your worries, What I have mentioned is standard advice about food preparation. If you are still unsure, speak to your doctor. ",

        "post_content": "90% sure I've got a duodenal ulcer - usual internet listed symptoms. It is an idiopathic ulcer - I've tested negative for Helicobacter pylori. My GP tells me that there are no red flag symptoms, and has put me on the common PPI 20mg Omprazole which I take each morning and have been doing so for a bit over 4 weeks so far.......I'm now carefully trying to watch what I eat, and trying to eat more frequent, but smaller meals. However, it's just not getting better - it improves a bit for 2/3 days and then flares up again and becomes really painful again. This has been the pattern so far. I've suffered with stress symptoms for many years, and have had issues with duodenal pain before, but have resolved it with natural remedies. I tried the same again this time, but after 3 months with no success, decided to visit the GP. I'm also now struggling again with anxiety, especially this issue, particularly when I wake up at night and begin to worry about all that acid burning into my ulcer. I would like to ask you kind people how long I might expect this to continue, because I read that the usual healing time for a peptic ulcer is 4/6 weeks, but I've got no optimism that it'll be healed in that time now?........Also, will the stress/anxiety merely slow down healing, or stop it completely? I HATE taking tablets, and this is screwing up my life and my family relationships. Please advise, if you have similar knowledge of this, many thanks.",

Tests may need to be done to establish what is going on. Since you have had the pain for a few weeks, your doctor is the best person to reassure you. Trying to self diagnose, will lead to anxiety. Have you tried a food diary to see if a food sets it off? Have you eaten anything you wouldn't normally eat? Have you done anything strenuous recently and pulled a muscle? Have you noticed if stress triggers it?",

You can do the research yourself about this wonderful stuff. It wont hurt you at all. In other countrys they even use it in foods..so its safe. It kills H. Pylori but you also need a probiotic with it. Might have to take it for a few weeks??How are your bowel movements if you dont mind me asking? My daughter has tons of stomach problems, nervous problems, has periods of wanting to eat all day like you and by trial and error and lots of hours studying we're close to getting her well. Diet has A LOT to do with it. Gluten can make you super nervous too. I'd get off of it for a while to see if that helps. Let me know if you find out anything. Hope I helped you!! May need vitamins too. B vitamins help with your nerves!",

I was ok for the first day, but the second day I got really bloated and nauseas. On the third day I was sick 3 times. A lot of these health food shop tablets are not tested the way prescription meds are so the side effects are not displayed or known much about. You don't know how much of the ingredient is put in the capsules and how safe it is for human consumption because these supplements don't have the same tight laws protecting the consumer and the same rigorous testing as regular medication does. Also they are quite expensive, particularly if you have a bad reaction to them and can't have any more! I had asked my doctor about it and he hadn't even heard of them. ",

My symptoms: Night sweats- every night varying from severe (waking up at 2am completely drenched) to light where there are a few wet spots on my pajamas. This has been going on since around Christmas time. Cold symptoms- I have had this cold (cough, stuff/runny nose, sinus headaches) since Christmas. I went on an antibiotic but it never really went away. Bloating- Abnormally. I get bloated easily with certain foods and on/right before my period. This bloating is constant. Dizzy Spells- This is has been going on for around two weeks consistently, but off and on before that. I will feel dizzy and nauseous where I need to sit down or minimum close my eyes for a minute to ten minutes. When they are really bad I get blurry vision. Uncomfortable when pressed- My upper abdomen feels very uncomfortable when pressed on. I don't want to go as far as pain, but feels like way more pressure is being applied than actually is. I only really noticed it when they doctor pressed on it. I went to my general physician and they did a CBC, thyroid test, celiac test, and autoimmune tests (via checking my blood). Everything has come back totally normal. My blood pressure, heart rate, etc. all totally normal. No STD's either. They have scheduled me for a sonogram of my upper and lower abdomen. I think this is because of the pressure \"pain\" I felt when the doctor pressed on me, but I am not sure how that would relate to any of my other symptoms. If anyone has felt any of this or have any suggestions, let me know! ",

Maybe try a food diary to to see if you are intolerant to a food(s) and that is making you itch.

I am definitely starting to stress more about my symptoms because they are affecting my sleep pretty intensely. So, that could definitely be playing a factor in them worsening over time since it started.",

Try a food diary to see if the itching begins after a certain food (s) Some people break out in sweat with the intensity of their IBS pain. This may correlate if you are having abdominal pain at night that wakes you up. I haven't heard of itching being an IBS symptom.

He was VERY adamant that due to my age, that I am on a birth control that regulates my levels, I am not having any irregular periods and thyroid test came back clear, he does not think this is hormone related at all. Definitely worth asking, especially since this isn't something they have offered as a possibility. I hope it is that honestly! Seems like a simple fix. That is also something I will ask about! Maybe I get the ultrasound done and if all comes back good, I will work through seeing if this is IBS and finding any triggers for a month or two? If I am still having symptoms after a few months I can go back for more tests. Just trying to get rid of these dang annoying symptoms, without spending my whole savings if possible! ",

My Vitamin D levels were tested for a different reason some years back and were found to be fine. However, I seriously regret having this blood test because the nurse caused me permanent neuralgia and I am now unable to have these tests because I was advised by a doctor to avoid it as much as possible in case further damage is done. The only place that is relatively safe for me to have them done at hospital but even then I have to tell them all the complications I have and I discovered two possible allergies during the test: one to the needle and the other to the antiseptic used. I also had trouble with the elastoplast they used which was too tight and triggered my dodgy nerve conduction. I was warned this could happen and they could change the plaster in that event. ",

A doctor agreed to do it and said her veins were able to be seen and not small! I have no idea how this nurse damaged me; All I can think of is lack of training and incompetence. I couldn't see what she was doing. I think she thought the needle was a bayonet. The pain was terrible immediately after she took the needle out. She told me it would be a sharp scratch but it was significantly more than that. The swelling and bruising was extensive straight afterwards. I complained when I saw it but she said nothing. My doctor apologised on her behalf which was inadequate because it wasn't his fault. He should have made her phone me to apologise but he didn't and she didn't have the decency to do it herself. Five years on, it feels like the blood test is being done over and over again and if I ever see her I will have no trouble demanding an aopology and if necessary I will do it in front of everyone in the waiting area to humiliate her so everyone will know what she did and will have the sense to avoid her.",

Vagotomy Beta blockers - reduces contractility and automaticity of the heart which reduces irregular rhythms but also lowers blood pressure when symptoms occur, and further reduces perfusion ex: Carvedilol, this will control abnormal heart rhythms, but can precipitate Prinzmetal angina and heart block.

I asked him why he prescribed a BP Drug when I had no BP. He said that I have high palpitation since quite some time which may create further problems at some stage. Hence I started taking it for next many many years; half or even 1/4 of lowest dose after starting it for three months or so. I had discontinued it after many years when my pulse rate remained 50 Per Min which the Doc felt that it is too low for my age. Thus Tinarmin wasreplaced with equal lowest dose of Easyday still with no BP but possibly to prevent heart complication. I am presently of advanced age with no heart problem so far and no sugar. My BP uptill now remained normal in summers and slightly raised in winters for which I am taking a bit of BP medication; Easyday of suitable mg these days.

        "post_content": "hi so i have had issues with very loud burping for a few years and last year it got bad. GP has had me on omeprazole on and off in that time and didnt seem to do anything. started getting bad anxiety and found out i had helicobactor. finally fjnished antibiotics but still felt crap, still burping, lost over a stone and was left with bad acid and heartburn after antibiotics. started taking omega 3 and probiotics but didnt help. gp sent me for a nasal endoscopy . i think i had convinced myself for many many years i had stomach cancer but endoscopy showed everything was normal with just a small bit of gastritis which they think was from antibiotics. tedted me for helicobactor and that came back clear!!! but i am still burping ! really loud and deep all day. my stomach still feels like its rumbling now and again. my apetite is great now nut dont seem to be putting on any weight( i am exceptionally skinny and always have been and always struggled to put on weight) my bowels are normal. i had bloods just after christmas and they were fine . i have suffered with back pain for nearly 4 years since having my aon as a very hard birth but its really bad at the moment on the lower part of my back and i keep getting burning all at the top of my back ?? i am just lost. i really thought i would be all better as endoscopy came back clear??? do i have cancer in the lungs or chest now or down below somewhere ??? i just dont understand how im not feeling better!!! is there something else i could be taking to help stomach issues ?? should i start taking my omeprazole again ?? help please. i really need to stop this vicious cycle of feeling like im constanntly dying !!

It sounds like your endoscopy wasn't entirely clear since slight gastritis was found. Your symptoms sound like it. H pylori can cause gastritis. The treatment for this is PPIs which you have been taking. These medications help to protect your stomach lining from excess acid. I would go back to your doctor and say that the omeprazole didn't really help before and ask if you should go back on them at a higher dose or try a different PPI. Try a food diary to see if a particular food is irritating your stomach which can happen with gastritis. Don't worry about your weight. Try to be happy about being slim because that seems to be your natural metabolism since you have always been that way, You don't have to put on weight to be healthy. I am very healthy and very skinny and bony because I have a fast metabolism which is perfectly normal. Stress can cause you to lose weight. Try relaxation therapy and try to focus on a hobby or light exercise to take your mind off your stomach. I have IBS which is now in remission because I have plenty of things to enjoy which keep me calm and stress free. At the height of my IBS which lasted three and a half months, I found that I had interludes of no pain when I was out with friends and having fun.",

        "post_content": "Hello everyone! This is my first post here and I hope it is under the right category. I am in despair to find a solution to my problem, which has been bothering for more than a year. My issue is related to long-term bloating. Also, I don't know how to describe my stool, but it is far from normal, like small pieces. Also, I experience chronic fatigue and nervousness. I visited a lot of doctors and they just say relax, change your lifestyle and diet, do more physical activity. I did ultrasound and everything was fine. Also, I did did urine and blood test, and also everything was fine, except a bit increased cholesterol and glucose (nothing much). Additionally, I did gastroscopy and and I have some little erosions on my gizzard, but nothing to worry about. The doctor gave me documentation to educate myself since he said I have the first stage of gastroesophageal reflux disease, but I doubt it. Also, I did a test for helicoid bacteria and it was negative. Beside all of this, I've been undergoing bioresonance therapy, which detects that my lymph is not in balance, I have gut nervousness and some bacteria that they treat with natural medicines. I started undergoing acupuncture to try to relax a bit. I did a food sensitivity test and it eliminates almost all food that I used to eat and my blood type is A. Gluten test is negative as well. It is true that I used to do a lot of sports in the past and now I spend most of time sitting and not having proper diet. Also, I am a sensitive person who stresses a lot about minor things and I think that I experience anxiety and depression to some extent. I stress about my future and don't have optimistic thoughts. It would be really useful if someone could help me to break this dilemma if this long-term bloating is being caused by my mental state or it could be some physical issue like hidden bacteria/parasites/ bad lifestyle? I simply cannot realize if anxiety causes bloating or bloating causes anxiety. ",

Best way to find out is stop eating gluten and dairy for a week and reintroduce and you will know if that's the culprit( which u probably knew). My daughter has IBS and it makes her super sensitive. Cries at the drop of a hat. Has OCD. Skin problems. Can get diarrhea if she doesnt eat rice or something starching like gluten free bread before she eats high fiber foods like veggies and fruit with peeling. If I had to guess, its something your eating or how your eating it. Try rice before each meal and see if that helps your bowel movements. Never eat raw veggies/salad on an empty stomach. What does your diet consist of? Processed food? Artificial sweetners? Do you have mouth sores? Just FYI, IBS does not show up on any test including endoscopy because it doesnt damage anything in your body. Fish oils with peppermint helps my daughter and metamucil to help slow down the colon. This is only if u have IBS..but its not gonna hurt to try a few things to see if it helps. If its gerd then baking soda will take that away. That's been my experience anyway....sprinkle very little ( a dash) in a glass of water before bed and dont eat anything else for the night. I think it took mine about 3 weeks to go away. I'm not a doctor by the way haha ..hope this helps cause I know this is stressful.",

But problem still same. Last month in January, Gastroenterologist prescribed Pantoprazole and Hunger Syrup. Took it for some days since then heartburn has improved very much. But appetite is still sluggish. Somedays good , somedays bad. Stomach pain occurs but rarely like once in some days only. But the fear of Pancreatic Cancer has caught hold on me. Although as i eat outside foods sometimes only. Is there anyone who had similar symptoms? What was your diagnosis? Any suggestions? The thing that so much time has already passed makes me more tensed.",

My period (withdrawal bleed from the pill) ended the day before this began. It was no different than my normal periods. I called my dr but they are closed for the holiday today and I am freaking out because i dont know what is going on with me. Of course the internet doesnt help. I keep reading about implantation cramping but I have missed no pills, my bf wears a condom on days my calendar says i would ovulate even if it failed, and we use the withdrawal method on the other days. I have no other symptoms but this mild cramping situation that is moving around. Any ideas so I don't go insane? ",

Been having some problems with my stomach lately, I sometimes have a light discomfort under my left rib, this discomfort comes and goes and I've had it for about 3 months now, I have also been having a excessive amount of gas (mostly in the morning) and some stomach cramps once in a while, this is also sometimes accompanied by a light headache. Could it be stress causing this? been having a lot of anxiety since I have been struggling with frequent urination which my doctor guessing is because of OAB. Had a number of test like urine test, x-ray of kidney and bladder, blood test, Cystoscopy and now a CT scan of the abdomen, everything was fine, except from a small amount of blood in my urine Am I being crazy or do I have a reason to be worried? I'm a 28 year old man. Much appreciated Thanks! ",

Pelvic Ultrasound Abdominal Ultrasound ECG Chest X Ray Blood Tests Urine Sample Stool Sample CRP Blood test Over the past 2/3 weeks i have been taking probiotics and inulin and my stomach definitely has started to feel better than it did but now i have this ache in my back that radiates around my waist and into my right hand rib cage. I often feel breathless with an accelerated hear rate. I have also been having night sweats, pretty much every night for the past couple of weeks. Im not waking up soaking wet but definitely wet enough to make the bed damp. I also have this know type feeling in my abdomen like strain or something, the joint in my right elbow hurts on and off also. I feel like this is taking over my life, im constantly worried, i wake up grumpy, moody, irritable, im impatient, cant concentrate and am short tempered. Im worried that i have carcinoid syndrome or lymphoma etc as alot of my symptoms match up. Has anyone been through this or is going through this? ",

I think if you had anything serious going on, it would have shown up on your tests and your doctor would have told you about it. Remember, the medications you have been taking have helped your IBS, so believe your doctor! Anxiety aggravates IBS and can cause pain in the body and sweating. Night sweats are also associated with the perimenopause/menopause if you are close to fifty. Some people get rib cage pain with IBS and rib cage pain can also be caused by costochondritis which can start because of stress. Try not to google your symptoms; you will only get inaccurate results which will lead to anxiety. Only listen to your doctor. iBS symptoms can cause anxiety. Try relaxation and distraction techniques for your health anxiety. Before my IBS diagnosis, I had terrible health anxiety due to googling symptoms and getting no diagnosis for three and a half months and I was convinced I had all sorts of serious conditions that had been missed. Once I got my diagnosis, my IBS went into remission and my health anxiety completely cleared up.",

                "comment_content": "Hello, aside from test results and supplements. Take a look on your diet that causing your IBS and other symptoms. Are you eating more processed foods, lactose, chocolate, ice cream, milkshakes, dairy, milk, wheat, pasta, pizza since you were young? If yes, these are the major triggers of your IBS. And the best to do is to eliminate these on your diet so the rest of the symptoms like pain, night sweats, anxiety etc. will be gone. Dairy, refined flours from bread or pasta and fried foods are mucus producing that encourage toxins to accumulate in your colon or large intestine resulting to abnormal contractions of your colon. But rest assured there's NO inflammation going on in your intestine. People with IBS are less tolerant with the pain so the number 1 they usually recommend is to take 1-2 enteric-coated peppermint oil capsule twice daily between meals to alleviate pain and cramping. If you don't like capsule, peppermint tea will work. Drinking water, fiber and activity helps your constipation. vegetable juice is a good way to eliminate toxins from your colon. I definitely believe this is NOT carcinoid syndrome, lymphoma or any type of cancer because you have NO bleeding anywhere from your intestine base from the test results. I believe your Doctor is right that this is IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) which is NOT life-threatening.",

Sometimes toxins and food are the cause, but in my case,the main cause was stress caused by the severe pain and mental stress of chiropractory and deep tissue massage, My doctor recognized my IBS as triggered by stress and nothing to do with food or toxins when I told him about the six months of stress I had experienced starting with chiropractory, deep tissue massage and an incompetent nurse botching a blood test done to establish why I had nine months of problems after chiropractory and massage. Personally, I don't believe toxins are released after these treatments. For me, it was an severe immune response which was never picked up by doctor because I never went back after my blood test injury which turned into permanent neuralgia.",

Anything unabsorbed and hard to digest food should be eliminated because if they stay longer in the colon, they will decay, decay means they becomes poison to the body. This is now what happening to IBS, there are so many undigested food that stays longer that becomes TOXINS to the system, that's why it triggers the colon to contract in segmental and mass movement to throw these toxins, as a result, people with IBS usually have diarrhea or constipation or both. So for Mary, you just created this statement from your imagination that toxins release from deep tissue massage will be trapped in the colon thus causing IBS, I can't even imagine how toxins will go through the peritoneum of the Gastrointestinal tract. In order for the toxins to pass through the colon, it must go internally, from mouth, stomach, small intestine, down to colon. I knew the original statement for this is that toxins release from the kidneys only, not to GI tract. Remember toxins should be huge enough to make the colon contacts not the tiny toxins that are trapped in the colon. Stress is just the secondary reason for IBS not the main cause, otherwise, it's not IBS anymore, it could be indigestion, stress could also cause bloating and indigestion, and acne and many more. Immune response is like out of nowhere in this subject of IBS. Right now, I am not sure if I would regret replying to both of you. since both of you were like Pharisees, the wordly wise during the Roman empire. It's like trying to search for mistakes for every word in my statement rather than listening and understanding my thoughts. lels.",

My doctor was more interested in eliminating other conditions rather than listening to me when I told him that my symptoms began immediately after the treatment. To me it seemed that my immune system flared up and caused the side effects. It was certainly fighting something, very likely it detected a foreign agent in my system after the treatment and went into attack mode to defend me and expel the ememy. I think my body was left in such weakened state that it couldn't shake off for nine months what the treatments left behind. I ended up with about five recurrences of the cold in a short period of time and even when I recovered from that, I had the botched blood test which threw my body into shock mode again and within two months, I got IBS because I couldn't cope with the stress of it. I am aware that deep tissue massage may cause a release of toxins, however, this was was never mentioned or confirmed in my case, so I am unsure if this is what I experienced. Probably, it is different for everyone. ",

We breathe in toxins everyday which can get into our blood stream and be carried to and get trapped in our tissues which in turn can cause pain in our muscles and ligaments thus we get help from a chiropractor to get some relief from pain. The deep massage will in all probability release some of the toxins trapped there. Which in turn will go through our system into our colon which in turn will cause gut problems and IBS. We can have gut problems from food and anxiety which causes our gut to get out of zinc. Research is still ongoing so nothing is set in stone, but you have experienced it first hand.

As well as research suggesting that deep tissue massage is good for releasing toxins, there is also powerful evidence saying that the body has its own natural way of expelling toxins via the lymphatic system and there is no need for masseurs to try and force them out unnaturally where they will run riot in our bodies causing more problems. Unfortunately, we are not told this side of the story because alternative practioners want to sell us their services at huge financial cost. The best truly safe natural treatment is heat because it doesn\u2019t interfere with the body\u2019s metabolism and doesn\u2019t cause pain. Each of us, of course, should always do what we think is best for us, but at the same time I think it is only fair to warn people what they are getting into because chiropractors and masseurs and even doctors won\u2019t. Luckily, my IBS has settled down although I am having a prolonged bout of reflux and I am having to take lots of antacids to keep the heartburn cough at bay. Hope all is well with you too. ",

I had chronic, muscusy/greasey dirrhea. When I turned 23 I started putting on weight uncontrollably. I have gained 70 pounds in two years. My gastro issues have turned into constipation with bloating and not being able to fully relieve myself. I still have bouts of diaherrea every few weeks. I also am constantly itchy and will wake up in an itching fit. It leaves welt looking marks, dermatopraphica. I sweat prefusely all of the time. I have HORRIBLE fatigue. My period has gone from 5 days to 2 and have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. I have tried Lexapro, cymbalta, and wellbutrin. I have never had that \"sun coming out from behind the dark clouds\" feeling. I gave up taking them because they each had side effects that were bot worth dealing with so I've been off medication for about 6 months now. I'm managing my anxiety pretty well, but it is always lingering. I have tested negative for celiacs and cushings. I have gone to the ER 2 twice in 3 years because my stomach has hurt so bad. Both times I was sent home with a mental health packet \"because my anxiety was probably causing bouts of irritable bowl syndrome\" Am I crazy for thinking there's something more to this? Please, if I am, let me know because I would love to just call it whatever at this point.",

        "post_content": "Hi there, My 19 year old son has been suffering with debilitating nausea, upper abdominal ache (sometimes lower), indigestion, bloating, weight loss, extremely low energy levels, very low blood pressure for the past 10 months. Before this he was extremely active and happy, now he can barely leave the house. he was referred to a gastroenterologist and has been tested for Addisons disease, infection and celiacs (although it doesnt seem related to his diet). The results of barium follow through, abdominal ultrasound,MRCP and CT scan on brain all came back clear. It's months between gastro appointments and so frustrating not to have a diagnosis. He's tried PPIs, IBS medications, anti depressants as well, but nothing seems to help. Cant stand seeing him like this and becasue of his age the doctors don't take it seriously when it's completely ruining his life. I' ve had to fight and complain to get every test he's had done carried out, as left to their own devices he'd have had two appointments with the gastro in 10 months. Not sure where to go from here though, the next appointment with gastro is in 4 months time, meanwhile he's still so ill. Any advice appreciated",

An online doctor asked me if I had noticed any triggers such as stress or food and I said I hadn't noticed anything like that. It took eight visits to several doctors before stress was identified as the cause of my IBS. I hadn't thought to mention it because I didn't know it was relevant. It is possible to have hidden stress. Perhaps consider that. Gut disorders involving abdominal pain can be very hard to diagnose. I had to wait 3 and a half months for diagnosis while experiencing severe, multiple health anxieties. I had to find my own antispasmodic because a previous doctor tried me on one that made me far worse.",

The pain is pushing through to my back and chest quite severely the pain also seems to be giving me pulsating headaches. I am just getting quite worried as I need to eat but feel like fearing any food because of the pain and discomfort it is bringing me - any ideas of what could be causing this or if anyone has experienced the same kind of thing ?",

        "post_content": "Hi i've signed up to here because i feel like im running out of options, i've always suffered with anxiety and depression but recently ive been going through something i've never been through before, I can't go more than a couple of days without severe stomach discomfort and pain with what feels like bloating. I thought maybe it's certain foods that are triggering it but even after eating clean I can still be bad, it feels as though it's stress or anxiety related but i just don't know anymore. I need to be able to work to pay rent but in my current state I'd never be able to hold down a job. Most of the time it starts in the early hours, ill wake up feeling anxious with my heart racing and then things slowly go worse from there normally with my swallowing as my sinus's feel irritated or something at the back of my throat though I don't have a cold, I keep doing this and gradually end up with a build up of gas in my stomach which is really uncomfortable and end up unable to do anything the rest of the day apart from wait for bedtime again and hope for a better day. Ive been on citalopram 20mg over 10 years but last year I changed to escitalopram as I thought maybe they'd help more with my depression, i was on them a few months but i kept getting headache on them and didnt like the sides so gradually came off them, I then did a few months without anything but everything got too much with me, stress of losing a job and then a pet dying sent me over the edge and I ended up back at the doctors and on citalopram 10mg. This was about a week before January, I was getting really bad sides off them they'd make me feel high but not in a good way but i stuck with them, this was also when my stomach started getting worse, i'd often wake up at 3-4 am and be unable to go back to sleep with too much going on in my head. After seeing the doctor again he prescribed me omeprazole 20mg, which have helped a bit, I no longer have acid and I don't wake up as early anymore and when I do sometimes I can get back to sleep. so in that regard things have improved a bit. I ended up halfing my 10mg citalopram and have been on 5mg a day for a couple of weeks now as the sides just wern't going away and I felt it was irritating my already sensitive stomach. I've had stool samples and it came back as fine, im booked in for a blood test and ultrasound on my stomach and the doctor recommended to double my dose of omeprazole one in the morning and one at night. Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to get it all off my chest ive been suffering for months now with the odd good day in between I feel like this is how it's going to be now from now on with no end in sight. The stomach discomfort makes me really irritable and unsociable i just want to stay in my room until it passes and any human interaction just bothers me. ",

In the suspicion I tried entering a lubed gloved finger in to the rectum and felt nothing. So I'm not sure what problem I do have if I even have one, the symptoms of slight discomfort and passing of diarrhoea like stool are there but I felt nothing in my rectum and I don't feel particularly constipated or bloated, but i feel a constant growling and the need to go pass stool every few hours is suspicious. I don't want to go the doctor too on a slight suspicion since I'm currently in a foreign country.",

Meaning, this is NORMAL. We also shed mucus in our stool. - *Pathophysiology 6th edition by Carol Porth* Also, you are correct, it's not IBS since you have NO PAIN. The hallmark of IBS is increased sensitivity to abdominal pain, secondary is unpredictable constipation and diarrhea.",

And to be completely honest what I believe helped was the prep that completely cleared my gastrointestinal symptoms.

I use google a lot to figure things out when i do not want to wait for my next appointment. Sometimes it is scary just waiting. Basically, though I am no expert, it sounds like it is a normal colonoscopy. I have had several and believe it or not the Dr. would most certainly have said something right after your test. I have also been there when my spouse had their colonoscopy and he was told during the procedure that they found a polyp and removed it. What they do here in the US is just snip it off and cauterize at the same time. If they suspect anything whatsoever they send it to be analyzed, which is called a biopsy. I know it is easy to worry but if you do feel the least amount of anxious just call your physician and ask. The physician will understand your concern and discuss with you the results, but you have to make that call. Hope this helps you to feel okay about asking for your health care provider to explain to you more fully your results. ",

I have a very balanced diet and am not under or overweight. However, my stomach bloats like a balloon when I eat. It gets very hard and aches for hours. I burp very loudly and frequently, even after water. The burping hurts when I hold it in or try to close my mouth to burp. It leaves a burning sensation in my chest. I feel like I always have to burp and sometimes try to push as much gas out through these burps but the gas seems never ending. My stomach can only deflate after push out my burps for a really long time. I tried not eating since the bloating hurts so bad. But all I get is even bigger burps from being hungry and a burning sensation in my stomach and throat. The bloating gives me sharp pain as well. I went to my doctor about this when it wasn't as severe and nothing was found. I take Gas-X and it doesn't help. I dont know what to do",

I have had reduced to no appetite (although eating and Maintaining weight), upset stomach (not all the time. In morning after wake up and after eat), stomach gas (feels like somebody is popping plastic packing wrap inside). Feeling fatigued in general. At times I feel like my appetite is slowly coming back. I have been to the Dr. 3 times. I have had blood work done twice, right side abdominal ultra sound and a ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis. All has come back fine. I was put on an acid blocker and been taking probiotics. The gas significantly decreased after starting the probiotics. I have anxiety disorder and worry more than most. Should I relax and give it time OR should I seek more test? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you \ud83d\ude00",

Don't give up until you find a doctor that will do additional testing (including maybe a biopsy ). If they are so invasive, they cannot be dismissed and forgotten. Especially since they are causing you great discomfort. Do you have any other symptoms or signs of inflammation? How's your digestion and bowl movements? My husband has always had a few (medically confirmed) lipomas but only in his legs and on his back and they are very close to the surface of the skin. Doctors have offered to remove them, but we never seem to get around to doing that. After almost 20 years of healthy eating I slipped up and started eating all sorts of things that are not good for me. I'm not just talking about the types of food, but the quality. It worsened my arthritis AND I got two lumps. one in my finger and the other just bellow my jaw. Not to mention weight gain and other \"perks\". The ultra-sound of my finger has been done and the technician confirmed what that was NOT (a synovial cyst, because it wasn't linked to any joint), but he couldn't say what it actually was only by using ultra-sound. After I got back to healthy eating, my finger lump completely disappeared and I can feel the the one bellow the jaw is getting smaller and smaller. I have no idea if there was any correlation between my eating habits and this appearance/disappearance., but this is how it happened. In case you wonder what I eat: I avoid processed foods, grains, pseudo-grains, soy, carbs that make your glucose levels spike, starch... For lunch today I had a bit of fish and green beans (that's the only kind of beans I eat). I'm not hungry before noon, so I start eating and lunch. For a better digestion I use ginger and I also take a spoon or two of soaked chia seeds. I have also recently started preparing and drinking water kefir. It's tasty and very good for the gut. I hope you'll find a solution soon! ",

I have tried Metafiber, Benefiber, fiber foods, and drinking more water. Drinking a glass of warm water usually helps to stimulate a good bowel movement, but it is still incomplete. What happens is, I get a good size, well moisened stool, but behind that there is still the mass of dry hard stool backup that I can't budge. I have an appointment with a specialist later in the month. In the meantime if anyone could give me any further suggestions I would appreciate it. ",

I have taken probiotics and fiber supplements per my doctor after telling her about my issue. I have also tried suppositories, senna laxatives, milk of magnesia, and Miralax. She does not believe it to be a fissure or hemmoroids, but the toilet water is bright red and so is the toilet paper after each bm. My bum hurts for hours afterwards and I only have a bm once or twice a week, and there is never relief. It seems that if I am not constipated, I have terrible cramps in my uterus and intestines that feel like contractions until I am forced to run to the bathroom and bm multiple times until I take Tylenol or ibuprofen. What is happening? It has been 4 months of this and nothing seems to help.",

Visualized bowel loops appear grossly normal. No free fluid is seen in the peritoneal cavity. Impression: MRI Upper abdomen reveals:- \"Right simple renal cortical cyst\". Location of pain is: Right side ,below rib cage and above naval, also between both ribs(lower side). my best guess is pain is near Stomach, spleen, pancreas,liver, gall bladder Somebody please advise, what should I do next..Thanks in advance ",

        "post_content": "Hi everyone first time on a forum, don\u2019t know where else to go. All started with lower abdominal pain/burning, especially in the morning. I have had very bad/noisey gurgling noises everyday and ranges from the bottom of my abdomen to the chest/throat, this happens all throughout the day, and has been happening since the beginning over a month ago. The last couple of weeks I\u2019ve noticed the need to burp an abnormal amount but most of the time I can\u2019t get it out, this constant burping/trying to burp seems to be getting worse, this is happening all the time. I\u2019ve started getting slight heartburn (not everyday) recently also and sometimes a lump feeling in my throat. I get crazy head pressure and is getting a lot worse and can come with chest pressure at the same time especially after I eat I got this at the very start. As for the Abodominal pain, it seems to have got a lot worse in the higher region of my abdomen around my stomach/lower chest it is as if the pain is moving upwards as time goes by, the chest pain is affecting my breathing. my lower abdomen is still painful but not as bad as it was at the start but there\u2019s still pain there. I\u2019m also getting random pains all down my back in the bottom middle and top regions. Lastly I\u2019ve been coughing up blood the past two days (not a massive amount). I got a abdominal and pelvic CT scan and doctor said I have diverticular disease but this doesn\u2019t explain half of what\u2019s going on. stress definitely makes everything worse, it\u2019s just the fear of the unknown. Once I know I can be a bit more happier, as I\u2019m very sad and miserable at the moment and hardly eating. Has anyone had these symptoms? Or can relate to anything? Thank you so much if you took the Time to read my boring problems I really appreciate it",

                "comment_content": "Hello Pete. Are you sure your symptoms have nothing to do with your diagnosis? If you're sure that they don't, were you taking any medication before and during the first time your symptoms appeared? I'm thinking it could be side effects. Also, the heartburn, lump feeling in your throat, burping issue and chest pain could all be signs of GERD/LPR. I'm not a medical professional, but I've dealt with it for a few years now and it sounds like some symptoms I went through. But then again, it could be something else. Has your doctor checked your gallbladder or appendix? Those could possibly cause the pain in abdomen and back if it's localized to the right side. But I suppose your doctor already checked for that considering that you had a pelvic CT scan. As for the blood coughing, you NEED to see a doctor for that. I don't want to scare you, but it could be serious so please have it checked out. Lastly, I know how you feel about the fear of unknown. The anxiety, the overthinking... I say you just keep on fighting to get better and find out what it is that's bothering you. It may be tough, frustrating and time consuming, but it'll be worth it once you know how to get better. Best wishes, I hope you get it sorted out soon x",

        "post_content": "Hello. In October/November I've started feeling a weird, dull ache just below my right rib. The pain would extend to the back, also below the right rib. A week or so goes by and the pain got more severe. It was endurable and I could do normal actions, but it would hurt a lot when I would sleep on my back or lean on a chair. After a few days it subsided and returned to the usual dull pain, but this time it has traveled to my lower right abdomen. Sometimes the pain there would feel like gas got stuck, but it would never come out as gas. Other times it's a bit sharp, as if a metal stick was horizontally put in my lower abdomen. The pain in lower right abdomen also extends to my lower right back. I'm fearing I could be having appendicitis, but my friend who had her appendix removed told me that her abdominal pain was very sudden, came in one day, and was so severe that she couldn't walk. Also, I don't have a fever, nausea or vomiting. I do suffer from constipation (on and off) and I've had many hard stools (sorry TMI) for which I've heard could cause appendicitis. My right abdomen is also very tender, I clench my muscles to the touch. Blood work was good, my abdominal ultrasound was also good (I had it done because of urinal tract issues though) and my doctor was also poking me in my upper right abdomen (at the time only there I felt the pain) and she didn't mention appendix at all. Could this still be appendicitis despite the pain going on for so long? It's not my gallbladder, liver or kidneys... what else could it be except for appendix? I'm sorry for such a long post, I am just really worried and don't want to rush so soon to my doctor as my pain isn't excruciating. Any help is very much appreciated <3",

Gastritis can cause pain below the ribs and can cause upper abdominal pain. IBS could also cause ribcage pain in some people and IBS pain tends to move about all over your abdomen and causes bowel habit change such as constipation. I have IBS and experienced generalized, lower abdominal pain with constipation. Have you noticed any triggers such as stress or food? Have you tried a food diary. Keep going back to your doctor for further testing and a diagnosis.",

I wonder if IBS causes back pain as well? I am definitely under a lot of stress because of school which is why I wouldn't like it to be my appendix. The surgery and recovery take too long.

For the last month or two, I had pain in my tonsils. They were bloody and had puss (perhaps from tonsil stones), but I had no strep throat although my doctor gave me an antibiotic anyways. Fast forward to last week, I still had pain in my tonsils, but I also developed a \"lump in my throat\" feeling. It gurgles when I drink or eat, I have a burning sensation in my stomach, I feel nauseated and lethargic most of the day. Sometimes it feels like I need to puke. I have been burping more frequent as well which is unusual for me. My ears also hurt and ache. It doesn't necessarily hurt to swallow although my mouth is incredibly dry and saliva seems to get stuck. I see an ENT on Tuesday. I'm very concerned and I wish I hadn't googled anything because now I'm worried I have esophageal cancer or something untreatable. I suppose what I need is a friendly reply or reassurance although I know an online forum can only do so much for me. The anxiety and worry that I have is making my life worse because I keep seeing rare and incurable cases. I'm afraid to eat or drink anything and I find it difficult to sleep with all of this going on while I'm burning in my lower abdominal region all night. I'm very scared, I guess. Is anyone else feeling like this? ",

To be suddenly bombarded by symptoms without explanation can be a troubling thing. But you have done the correct thing and put yourself in the capable hands of your doctor. Everything will be fine :) Now with regards to your situation in particular, it sounds all to familiar to me. Like you, I never experienced anything like 'heartburn\" or \"reflux\" for my entire life. Then within 1 week I began to experience a whole host of symptoms such as dull/aching chest pain, belching more than normal, ear pain, excess saliva that made me constantly swallow, throat clearing and coughing, gurgling sounds when drinking, worsening symptoms during workouts, and especially the \"lump in the throat\" sensation. Like you, I went to the doctor who saw mild throat irritation and I was placed on an antibiotic. Things did not improve so I went to an ENT and eventually a Gastorenterologist. Long story short, I was indeed having \"reflux\" due to a small hiatal hernia that was likely caused/worsened by weightlifting. For yourself, I must honestly say that most if not all of your symptoms are extremely likely to be reflux related or due to an H-pylori infection in your stomach. With regards to the reflux, you are probably thinking \"how can I be refluxing without heartburn?\" Well, not all reflux is acidic enough to actually \"burn.\" But nonetheless, it can still irritate your esophagus enough to cause chest pain and back pain, as well as travel high enough to cause throat pain, and yes, even ear pain. With regards to the possible H-pylori infection, your symptoms are classic. H-pylori is a stomach infection that commonly presents as an ache or burning pain in your abdomen, abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, frequent burping, and reflux. This reflux is due to either increased stomach secretions or inflammation near the top of the stomach/base of the esophagus that weakens or opens the lower esophageal sphincter, which when operating normally, closes off the stomach from the esophagus. Inflammation in this area can cause the LES to not close properly or operate properly thereby allowing reflux. My sense is that everything you have said points directly to an H-pylori infection or possibly reflux. Both are extremely treatable :) Now with regards to your anxiety about something like esophageal cancer, let me comfort you by saying that literally NOTHING you have said points to that. Obviously, I am not God nor am I your doctor. But as someone who has researched and experienced much regarding reflux disease and hiatal hernias and esophageal disorders, I can assuredly tell you that none of your symptoms point to esophageal cancer. The VAST majority of people who have esophageal cancer have no symptoms whatsoever until the tumor in their esophagus begins to grow large enough to prevent food from being swallowed. Some of the other \"red flag\" warning signs are things like drastic weight loss, passing black stool due to the cancer bleeding into your digestive tract, trouble swallowing food, or growing lymph nodes in the collar bone region. When I met with my GI, who performed my endoscopy that led to my diagnosis of a hiatal hernia, he asked me if I had any of those 4 symptoms. Furthermore, he told me that the vast number of people who are diagnosed with esophageal cancer are older in age and that I, at 35, would be the youngest he had ever seen in his practice if, indeed, I had esophageal cancer. You are 21. Lastly, you are on the right path already. People who develop cancer of the esophagus due to reflux generally have heartburn for years upon years, without treatment or preventative lifestyle changes. That is not you. And you certainly have a good doctor. Sending you to an ENT is standard procedure in a case like this in order to gather more information and they have done that. Ultimately, nothing from your post worries me, Kylee. So relax, trust your doctors, trust God, and you will be just fine :)))))) A quick question though, if you don't mind. When you say you have pain in your chest, where is that pain? Is it at the base of your sternum? Is it underneath or below your left ribs? And hey, keep us updated ok? And if there are any questions you have, ask away! :) - NC ",

It means a lot to me as I've felt very isolated during this experience. I know my worries are definitely blown out of proportion, as I said, I wish I didn't Google anything because I happened to come across a young female who later passed from cancer and had symptoms like me, so that certainly didn't help! I find a lot of relief in your post and I'll read it whenever my anxiety sparks up badly again. As far as chest pain, it's a strange sensation. It is definitely not as strong as the other symptoms I'm experiencing. A sharp pain occasionally hits my collarbone region or center of my chest and then seemingly disappears. I also have a strange feeling when I inhale deeply; its that feeling as though you're about to get a bad cold a few days prior to it (i.e. very mild chest pain) Although I know it's not from a cold because I've had this feeling for weeks. Again, I am really appreciative of your time and I will be more than happy to update everyone because I know how scary this can be.",

And yes, using Dr. Google can be a bad idea in that you will always find worst case scenarios that are not at all representative of reality. You wont find posts or articles about the millions of other cases that were not life threatening lol. So it truly does skew one's perception towards the negative. Furthermore, Dr. Google will of course tell you that every pain or symptom you experience \"could be cancer.\" This is because as humans, we can get cancer in practically every part of our bodies. Thus any symptom in any part of the body \"could\" be cancer be theory, though it rarely is. That is why if you look on WebMD, they will list cancer as a possible cause of every imaginable symptom from a headache to blowing your nose \"too much.\" But telling someone that their cough \"could be a cold or cancer\" doesn't usually help much haha. That is why we have doctor's, thank heaven. With regards to your chest pain, it sounds very much like an irritated and inflamed esophagus. When an esophagus is irritated by reflux, it can transfer pain throughout the chest, back, neck, and shoulders. The vagus nerve, for example, is in close proximity to the esophagus. When I was symptomatic originally (and even still now on occasion) I would have shots of sharp pain seemingly scatter to various parts of my chest, collarbone, neck, back etc. And in general, there was a rawness and overall ache to their entire chest area that was pronounced when taking breaths. It was very much as you described it .... as if you are getting sick by breathing cold, raw air. I would tell my GI that every deep breath made me. feel as though my chest was brittle and broken. As my esophagus healed and was no longer inflamed, so also did such feelings go away. You are on the right path to figuring this all out, rest assured :)",

                        "comment_content": "Hey :) It is certainly true that many people, such as myself, will have symptoms from reflux that are atypical, meaning not common or normal. For those of us that don't have typical heartburn, it will present as pain in the throat, chest, neck, collarbone, back etc. So when you talk about one side of your throat hurting or throat tightness, it tells me that yes, there is possible inflammation in those areas which feels like a thickening or tightening. That \"lump in your throat\" feeling is not a lump, but rather inflammation. The mucosa reacts to damage and irritation by secreting more mucus than normal. This all leads to things feeling swollen, thick, tight, occasionally painful, but not outrightly and constantly painful like strep throat, for example. ---- When you said it feels like you have to work a little harder to swallow things down, that is not a tumor in your esophagus, but rather inflammation. When things are swollen or inflamed, they feel tighter and less fluid in motion. ---- With regards to the pain under your arm, yes there are lymph nodes there ans yes, swollen lymph nodes can cause pain. However, they often have to swell to quite a large size to be even felt, much less be the source of pain. Im guessing that you don't have a lump larger than a grape in your armpit :) And even if there was a swollen lymph node, all it would mean is that your body is fighting something. Swollen lymph nodes mean your body's defenses are working and catching issues. Also, axillary lymph nodes under your arm handle infections and issues from your arm and the breast region of the chest, basically speaking. It is highly likely that the pain under your arm is a transitory symptom of something completely unrelated and not serious. ---- We all have a tendency to associate every symptom we feel in our body with whatever issue is on our mind. Yes, the body is a connected system, but not every pain or oddity is necessarily connected to the same issue. And the vast majority of symptoms we experience day to day are transitory. If the pain under your arm persists or worsens, certainly mention it to the ENT. But beyond that, it is not notable or troubling :)",

I assuredly fell into the same anxious thinking when this all started for me. I had never been seriously ill in my love, by God's blessing, was very fit and constantly exercising .... then suddenly a torrent of symptoms hit me like a wave. Exhaustion, coughing, throat clearing, chest pain, chest aching, back aching, neck pain, swallowing issues, food getting stuck and regurgitating .... and so on. I was CONVINCED I had cancer. I even told my GI this and he said everyone assumes the worst but it rarely ever is. The truth of the matter is that I was blessed to have that situation happen to me for many reasons. One of them was that I learned that I had a hiatal hernia that was causing reflux and therefore was able to take the necessary steps to be treated. You are doing the same thing and that is 100% positive. The true danger is for those individuals who go their whole lives undiagnosed and untreated and actually end up developing esophageal cancer due to untreated and prolonged (decades) Gerd. So believe it or not, what you are going through is a blessing because it will identify the problem and allow you to treat it instead of allowing it to fester for years without you being aware of it. Many positive things can come from painful, fearful times. Admittedly, it doesn't seem like that while you are experiencing it. But it is the truth :) - NC ",

It can cause really bad breath and thick mucus that drips from the back of the nose down the throat. It can get stuck in your throat and is hard to clear. You should pay another visit to ENT. The blockage may be caused by polyps in the sinus which may be causing the blocked sinus. Ask your doctor to refer you to the ENT clinic.....",

I then started feeling pain in the front right part of my abdomen, and basically between my belly button and all the way around to my spine around the right side. The pain can come in waves, and would affect some part of my right torso. It grew worse over the last 2 weeks, and has generally plateaued to where it's impacting my ability to work and sleep. I went to the hospital a few days ago, they did an x-ray, urine anlysis and blood test, and everything came back fine other than minor dehydration. Today I realized the entire right side of my torso, from my belly button all around to my spine, is now tender and slightly painful when I touch anywhere in that area. This pain feels like it's at the surface, not deep. I'd really appreciate any insight into what the cause might be, I'm generally a healthy 36 year old male, and while I've had lower back issues in the past, I've never had this type of pain and discomfort before.

Look up all the ones who practice in your local area. Experienced and written about surgeons are better, avoid ones that write about themselves. If it is possible for the hospital to give the notes to the surgeon prior to you seeing him that would help a lot. Good luck.",

I've got a similar hernia caused by surgery. not sure if it'll help you to know but these hernias are called 'Incisional hernias' they are caused by the stomach wall becoming so weak that the stomach muscles can't hold back the bowel so they poke through the muscles and stomach walls. They can be repaired by inserting mesh but they fail easily! I've had mine repaired 3 times now! After the 3rd attempt failed, I now still have the big hernia on my side. The NHS are not keen on doing the repairs because they class them as 'Cosmetic'. I hope your father can get his repaired and that it holds.",

                "comment_content": "Hi Carly may I ask how old your dad is? It's sad but sometimes true that elderly patients are not always seen as a priority anymore, it seems to depend very much on your local health authority and how much they are willing to spend on older patients. It sounds horrible -and it is!- but I think we all know this happens. It is, I think, very much a 'postcode lottery' in the UK. If you can afford to go private that may be your father's best hope for a speedy recovery. But if that isn't an option, I would certainly speak to his/your GP if you can, and see what he/she can do to help. I wish you both all the very best. x",
