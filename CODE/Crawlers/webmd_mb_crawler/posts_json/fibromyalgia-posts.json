[{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"2 days ago","post_title":"My Fibro Treatment Plan","post_content":"Although I've just recently been diagnosed with Fibro, I have been living with Fibro symptoms since 1998. During this time I was seen by 5 different physical therapists (for pain, weakness, and muscle knots and stiffness), 2\ngastroenterologists, 2 urologists, 4 neurologists, 2 ENT's, 3 mental health counselors, 4 orthopedists, 2 rheumatologists, an allergist, a dermatologist, podiatrist, and countless PCP's. After years of negative tests and scans they finally decided to call it Fibromyalgia. Sadly enough, almost no one (including some MD's) has ever heard of Fibromyalgia..let alone knows how to treat it. Well that can leave some people feeling hopeless and doomed. On the other hand, that can also motivate some (like myself) to find their own Fibro regimen!!!\n*****I'M ONLY SHARING MY OWN EXPERIENCES!!!!!!!!!!!!******\n1. STRICT Gluten Free Diet and\na Probiotic\n2. Appropriate Pain\nManagement \"Meds\"\n3. Physical Therapy/DAILY\nSTRETCHES\n4. Chat Room/Support/Mental\nHealth Couselor (living with\nFibro can get overwhelming)\n5. I do not read, eat, watch\ntv/device, or even\ntalk on my phone while\nin my bed (trained my body)\n6. Brain Food/Exercises/Games\n7. Wear KT Tape, orthotics,\nbraces and splints for\npainful/weak hands, elbows,\nwrists, ankles, feet, knees,\nand muscles ***IN ADDITION\nTO PHYSICAL THERAPY.***\nFYI, I came up with the Gluten Free diet on my own (my Gastroenterologist didn't even suggest it!!!) But while on the GF diet I lost 19 lbs in the first month without exercising or going hungry. JUST BY CUTTING ALL GLUTEN FROM MY DIET my painful, swollen joints returned to normal, my eczema is under control, I have less headaches, and my allergies are a lot less severe.\nI'm not claiming that I've found a cure for Fibromyalgia. I'm not even saying that MY TREATMENT PLAN will work for you. But I am saying that these are the things I have done for years to manage my numerous Fibro symptoms, and they still work for me.\nI HOPE THIS HELPS......GOOD LUCK","like_count":"0","tags":["Living With","Symptoms","Home Remedies","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/113902/my-fibro-treatment-plan"},{"post":{"author":"fibros","post_time":"4 months ago","post_title":"Fibromyalgia is it all in the HEAD.","post_content":"Hi, my name is Sylvia I'm almost 58 years old and have been diagnosed with FM approx 4 years ago. After 5 years of suffering numerous symptoms of which fatigue, to me was/is the worst.\n\nIn and out of hospitals and ER rooms, to many to mention, no one could diagnose the problem/s.\n\nUntil one day out of the blue, I started doing research desperation being my motivation, I stumbled on this word Fibromyalgia, after comparing various symptoms checking.\n\nI went to a Rhumetoligist that specializes in Fibromyalgia, which confirmed it and at last something started making sense.\n\nI, as many other women with FM have been told in the past, is a a condition caused in the brain, due to abuse, mentally or physically or both (basically a mental condition) \"It IS NOT An ACTUAL MEDICAL Condition\"\n\nHOWEVER -\n\nPlease explain to me, why I have the following :\n\nAfter a Nuclear scan, reported\nI have inflammation in all my joints, spine, neck, shoulders, elbows hips, hands, knees and ankles. (is this coincidental?).\n\nCPR OF 17mg/L (inflammation count in blood) 0 to 3mg/L is normal and over 10mg/L, a sign of an undiagnosed desease. (Is this coincidental?)\n\nI have IBS, (irritable bowl syndrome), most FM sufferers have it.\nI have NCS- Neuro Cardio genic syncope. Autoimmune heart desease,(is it coincidental?)\nI am Hypotensive, ( low blood pressure) and heart rate?\n\nNeurogenic bowel and bladder conditions. (unable to feel when to go to the loo.)\n\nVery low red blood count, (4 years ago, resulted into chest pains, dizzy spells, head aces and serious fatigue.) Blood count 5, women normal iron blood count +/-12.\nAfter blood plasma transfusion and iron/magnesium supplements, these symptoms improved dramatically. (Coincidences?)\n\nI also have diverticulosis?\n\nJust recently been discharged from hospital, with a bladder and kidney infection, of which I have had many. Report result confirming, urine draining from my kidneys are slow, does not empty completely, as too my bladder. (being the cause of my countless infections).\n\nDepression is a secondary symptom of Fibromyalgia, I can say this with overwhelming confidence, is due to obvious reasons, chronic pain and undiagnosed medical problems? And people telling you it's all in the HEAD. Our lives, for most of us, completely changed! From hero to zero.\n\nThis one was the last straw, when I read online, someone giving advise to exercise more, \"AS FIBROMYALGIA IS CAUSED FROM a SEDENTARY LIFE STYLE\" (fancy word for inactive).\n\nWhich is so RIDICULOUS! As a matter of fact, most people, mainly WOMEN, who have FM, prior to it, were hyperactive, multitasking professionals. Active in various sports all through school and after, also walking and gyming. I don't think this could be equated to to having an inactive lifestyle?\n\nNow what is it? FM and these actual medical conditions synonymous?\nNow like the chicken and egg dilemma, which came first and is there any relation?\n\nWorst of all, most medical staff I come across, are oblivious to what the condition Fibromyalgia is.\n\nAsk me I know, go to an ER Room and explain to the medical staff, you have Fibromyalgia and you are allergic to Quinolin (synthetic penicillin, just had to add this).\n\nThen people ask why are you so moody and irretable, and on the off chance you laughing and smiling, you told the condition is all an act?\n\nTo my dear fellow FM \"sisters\", hopefully soon we will see, some kind of apology, for what we TRUELLY, had to mentally endure, due to the ignorance of people.","like_count":"1","tags":["Medications","Living With","Symptoms","Daily Check-In","Home Remedies","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"4 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Fibromyalgia is it all in the HEAD.","resp_content":"FM is a combination of genetic variants and environmental triggers. FM is more of an umbrella term that can optionally include many issues. It is often seen along with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Marfans, (Over 215 genetic variants are now highly correlated with Marfans), and MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome). Getting a more refined diagnosis with a neurologist as well as a geneticist would likely help you. There are remedies (pharma and nutrition) that are helpful if you know what the underlying issues of FM are. As for IBS, it's likely the result of your body not producing sufficient digestive enzymes to process the complex sugars along with a profusion of nerve endings in the gastrointestinal track. You may benefit from a Low FODMAP diet. The Monash University has a handy \"Monash University FODMAP Diet\" app that can help you choose fruits, veggies, berries, etc. and in the appropriate amounts to minimize IBS.

Honestly, nothing seems to help; I've tried warm baths, cold tubs of water (makes it SO much worse) and different rubs. Even the newer lidocaine rubs don't seem to help.

I also have terrible foot and leg cramps, not sure if you get those as well? My feet cramp so bad that I can literally see three of my toes pull up slightly and sideways toward the edge of my foot. It hurts so bad and it will do that a couple times in the row. Another thing that happens to my feet and legs is sometimes when I start to get up from sitting or lying down my feet and lower legs gets pins and needles like they are asleep but I can get up and walk fine and feels like it went away then about minuteor somlater after I have gotten up and walked they go completely asleep like it should have done a minute ago and it is so painful I can't move or do anything and it feels like it last much longer than usual. It's like a delay before going asleep if that makes sense. It gives me a feeling like I caught it before it went to sleep. Does this make sense to you, it's really hard to explain without sounding crazy especially to anyone that doesn't have Fibro. Well anyway I thought I would throw that out there as well. You are not alone with the terrible foot pain, do you also get painful knee pain also? I am curious if others have this issue as well? I have arthritis so maybe it's not Fibro but I feel like my knee pain has intensified I have started using my Voltaren gel on my knees and it does help when they are at their worse and it gives me some relief. I am going to keep some gel next to where I sit and try it next time I start to feel the pins and needles in my feet and legs to see if it helps, it can't hurt. I sound like a sales person but I swear by my Voltaren gel it is about the only thing that eases that burning tightening muscle back pain I get from the back of my neck down to my tailbone.

I received 3 cortisone injection in my foot I thought I was going to Die!!! But after the pain subsided about 3 hrs later my foot feels much much better but I have to wear a brace now to keep the foot from turning inward It's very unnoticeable but this isn't Drs orders .So the moral to my story is yes the fibro gave me foot pain accompanied by triggering all my other ailments Arthritis I could literally written a Book on that you see when Im in a fibro flare up my left knee ,hip and neck arthritis all go Bananas it's crazy But thank God I can still walk and I'm smiling through the pain","resp_content":"God bless\n1\nReply\nbella1965\nover 2 years ago\nOnly1me217, we could be twins, lol.

I get shots in both knees every four months that is not pleasant I could only imagine the pain in your feet with injections. I assume you will have to get those sorta like how I have to do my knees. I have had to get a Rollator to use when I have extra walking to do as my balance is off, back and leg pain, feet & ankle swelling,etc., and if I just need to sit down to take a break or waiting in checkout line. It is my life saver although a pain getting it in and out of my car, thank god my mother is still getting around good she usually drives me to my Dr. Appt. I just don't feel safe driving much or far from my house due to all of the meds I take and I just fall asleep sometimes out of the blue, even standing up talking with my hubby, it's funny but dangerous. I seem to go thru cycles over and over for a week or two at the time for instance:\n:Can't sleep till 2-3am sleep in till 9-10am for awhile\n:Then I can't make it thru the day without a nap in the afternoon 2-5 pm\nGo back to bed 9-10'pm and wake up 8-9 am can't get enough sleep\n: Next I can't get to sleep at all maybe 2-3 hours up & down not restful sleep\n:Next go to bed 11-1 am back up 6-7 am etc, I am sure you know what I mean, it's never continuous or restful sleep cycles.

I am so use to having to describe everything in detail hoping my Dr.'s listen. I have the worst problem with my pain mgmt appts. I saw the dr first time I went then you only see him to sign Rx's and claim the main dr sees you every time I have a visit. The NP is nice but never looks in history I have to state each visit I've had three cervical disc surgery and Fibro, she looks at a old outdated MRI of my lumbar and says it looks great she doesn't know why I am in so much pain and that just makes me fume. I say that I do have osteoarthritis in my spine and she asks who said that, lol. I will say the head dr told me that my first visit and when I had my three spinal injections then she says well everybody has spine arthritis! WOW that kills me! I have to add the Fibro she says we don't treat Fibro and I have to say again the head dr says you do?? It's so sad but I can't get another facility to take me, she just hands me the prescriptions but she should know what's going on with her Pt's. Last visit she knocked down one of my morphines the extended release one because the pharmacy accidentally filled a Benzo, I was taking 30mg she changed it to 15mg and she told me you won't even notice it? Guess what I noticed it seems to wear off sooner! I hate going there but what do you do, always having to say the same things over and over. Do you see a Rheumatologist? I love mine he has really helped me and he listens or explains things in detail. Oh I wanted to ask if you know a good support group online? There is nothing in my area and I would probably miss a meeting I figure if I can find a online group that would work best for me.

You can probally skip PT and pain meds.....but you'll need to double up on the Omega-3 Fatty Acids to keep your mind sharp! The bottom line is if you lay around (I KNOW it feels like you CAN'T move) YOUR BODY MUSCLES WILL WASTE AWAY!!!\n*As for as sleep disturbances try taking your television, cellphone, and all electronic devices out of your bedroom. You absolutely can train your body. Device time should be in another room, no exceptions!

I'm now 28 and I've had fibro since I was about 14. It has impacted my life in such a negative way. I was rarely in school and on home tutoring most of the time. Because I was never in school I never had friends, nor could I engage in the typical teenager activity. I'm at a point where I've accepted that the life I had planned for myself it's just not compatible with fibro. There is a very important psychological aspect to fibro that I feel goes completely unaddressed. For me, I've found that I've had to essentially go through a grieving process for the person who I was and who I thought I would become. It's extremely painful when you have a passion for something and because of this condition, regardless of how much energy and work you put into it, it's just not always practical. And you have to allow yourself to grieve for the person you were before you got diagnosed. Because when you deal with the constant symptoms and effects of your quality of life with fibro a part of you does die. Making it worse is the attitude most people take towards it, belittling you, making you feel like you're using it as an excuse because you're lazy. But trust me, you are not lazy! You have a legitimate condition that affects more people then most of us could even fathom! And as horrible as this process is, know you're not alone, that there are many of us just trying to hang in there with you, and that we need to lean and support each other because most of the world doesn't get it.

I was diagnosed this year after about a two year development time. I COMPLETELY understand the thought of hating who you have become and feeling like your body has betrayed you. Or at least that’s how my version plays out. 2 years ago I was a strong, super fit person who was training for a marathon and today my idea of a marathon is getting up, showered and dressed for the day! Almost everything I did in my free time involved enjoying the strength of my body ( running, mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing...you get the idea). Basically almost everything I did was outside using my body, and in hindsight, taking what my body could do for me for granted. Every time I lost the ability to do something I love it was like a little death of a good friend inside. I have had to mourn for my old comfortable self where everything seemed to make sense and give into the idea that I was going to have to reinvent a new way of living to try to move on and be happy again. I seemed to have gone through stages of grief. Right now I’m getting over the anger stage and moving toward acceptance. There is a part of me that carries on and I have to wait for the universe to show me the lesson it has in store for me. I have been through many painful situations in my life and each time I have come out the other side having learned something valuable and stronger for it. The only thing I can suggest is to place yourself around people who love you enough to let you mourn and transform without judgement and try to be more mindful about life and be more grateful for what you DO have. It is NOT easy! Learning about mindfulness and starting a meditation practice has helped me. Don’t tell yourself you CANT do something. Tell yourself I can’t do it that way anymore so how can I still enjoy what I am passionate about in another way. This too is very hard and takes a lot of practice. These are just a few of my thoughts from experience and things that have helped me. Take what you like and leave the rest just take charge of your journey or it may eat you alive.

I had 43 of them. Or maybe there were 43 and I had 2/3 or 60% or?? I forget. But it was a huge thing. All u have described and more. I didn't understand the post-exersional malaise thing until too late though, and over did myself so badly I also developed chronic fatigue syndrome. Luckily I had a great dr in Houston and applied for and received SSDI in 2009 without ever being turned down. But I was very bad at that point - the cfs made things much worse. I had extreme depression and dispaired of ever getting better since only about 15% do.\nIn late 2013 I started seeing a Corrective Care chiropractor and experienced some relief. I had seen chiropractors before and got some, but not like I was beginning to see. It was slow but consistent relief. 2 years later I started having energy again. (And I used to have to stop to get my breath just walking from the handicap parking to the store entrances!) I quit using the electric carts at the store. I went to the mall - at Christmas! So I started working out at the gym and got a trainer. After a month I started slowly changing what I ate to eat healthier. I had never done that before. There's a lot more but I credit it all to the corrective care chiropractic. Most essential is the use of a vibration plate after the adjustment for at least 5 min. I could barely do 1 min the first time and actually almost collapsed. But I ended up doing about 10 each time.\n\nI'm not advertising anyone or selling anything. And I know many people can't afford it. But look into it. They will usually start u out with an exam and initial X-rays for about $50. Maybe less if u can get in on a monthly special or know someone.

They make sure u understand what subluxations are before letting u see your X-rays. Then when u see - it suddenly begins to make sense. And if they really can't help u they will tell u.\nBut really, ur body is made to keep itself alive. And most things - yes, even cancer, are ur body's way of staying alive longer.

The only time they are not there sometimes is when I wake up. But as soon as I get up they start. They will usually get worse as the day progresses. Sometimes they are just like pins and needles and then sometimes they get so intense they sting. The stinging will cause a sort of itching sensation. I have had this now over 6 weeks non-stop. I was diagnosed with fibro many years ago but have long since thought it to be in remission. My severe fatigue and deep muscle pain had improved to the point I felt fibro was in my past.

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis or Fibromyalgia and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue.

I have Fibromyalgia(chronic & fatigue),PTSD, anxiety disorder and digestive issues. Are any of your products helpful for these conditions? If so, which ones and which doses?

Do you offer use of this payment system?","resp_content":"Reply\nAnonymous\nover 1 year ago\nBACS is a UK system for transferring money from one bank to another or one account to another person's bank account, eg to make regular payments, for rent, loans, utiliti bills etc. You cn also use to to make one off payments. So for a tradesman that I have dealt with before I have no problem if he gives me his bank account details and I transfer cash directly into his account - some banks can do this in the same day. In UK it is recomended generally not to use BACS for shopping on ebay etc where you do not know the person you are dealing with as there is no simple legal consumer protection for you as a consumer or for your payment if you do not get the goods or they are not as advertised - you have no buyer protection from say Paypal or from the credit card provider (which there is in UK, I don't know about the US).\n\nStrangely to me this is possibly a UK based seller (I am not sure), but only giving an email address as contact - no registered business address or contact phone numbers.\nOn another webpage he replied to some questions and said that he did not use paypal.\nYou would have to trust him to protect your bank account details.\nReply\nsulliefox16\nover 1 year ago\nThx.

My name is Mark. I am a 30 year old male living with fibromyalgia. So I feel the soreness and tender points related to this condition, however that is the least of my problems. What is most bothersome is the lack of compassion and understanding with the co-symptoms. Bright lights, loud noises (sirens, music volumes, people yelling, babies crying etc), and the intensity of smell causes severe discomfort. I live in New York and on one of the hottest days on the train i smelled at least 40-50 conflicting body odors at once and I thought I was gonna pass out. Summers are the worse. What people perceive as 90 degrees feels like 110 degrees to me; the pollen count is so high and dust tends to accumulate more in my room this season, if I brush up against dust welts form. I also go to massage school and I’ve learned it causes a wide spectrum of symptoms that can mimic other conditions. I’m also gay and men especially have no empathy regarding my condition. Because this mostly affects woman I haven’t met another gay male who suffers from this. I feel sad and lonely. I have lost almost all of my friends because they never listen when I tell them the symptoms I feel. They often forget, some have made jokes about it, one calling me a hypochondriac. So they will blast music, badger me into traveling to them on the most scorching days. In regards to the hypersensitive skin I layed on my friendship bed and got swollen landing in the ER. He also never bothered to visit me, even check up on me the day after. I told the remaining 2 people I know as a safety precaution because they are not good on the upkeep of their house, to visit me instead since my room has reduced lighting, white noise makers, and hypoallergenic linens. They have yet to even visit me. Doctors, also unkind. The day I was pale and swollen from the allergic reaction, knowing my diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the ER, were playing it off that i was hallucinating and I was healthy with my normal skin complexion. They said it’s all in my head and have me an outpatient referral to psyche. I had to pay out of pocket to see my family doctor who’s staff I’ve known my entire life to tell me. You look really really pale and unwell. I broke down and cried because i finally felt as peace knowing I was not crazy and the doctor who wasn’t treating me was just unkind. I just want to talk. I get lonely and I just want to know if any other patients get the irritation to heat, prone to allergens, absence heightened senses.

I am a woman who is much older than you are, and I have had fibromyalgia probably since I'm in my twenties. It is surprising that not one person replied to you. On the other hand, how likely is it that people know about these posts? (I didn't know until today, when I came across it while looking for something else.) In any case, I empathize with you. You are not crazy at all. I experience the same things you have, and I am always very hot. Certain sounds as well as certain people's voices irritate me. Loud TVs, music, noisey public places are all triggers. Emotions flaring are triggers. Odors such as some foods, gasoline, moldy areas make me feel nauseous, and they affect body pain. I wake up during the night from the pain, and the areas of pain is so widespread now and constant, whereas, when I was younger, I'd get bouts of terrible muscle pain many times as reactions to stress or if I had a bad cold, flu, or another ailment. Oddly, staying in motion helps ease the pain (if you're not totally exhausted from the muscle weakness and pain). In recent years, I get exhausted from \"doing nothing,\" and the overall feeling is like having the flu x 10. There are web sites about fibromyalgia that are helpful. \"Fibromyalgia News\" is one of them. In short, there is no doctor that I've seen yet who has clear answers. I've only recently started taking Gabapentin 100 mgs about a year ago, and I only take it when sleeping becomes a problem. (My doctor prescribed 3 a day, but I just can't because I'm already exhausted, and that tends to make you drowsy.) I take the Gabapentin so I can sleep, if I'm really desperate. If you're like me, you have a lot of nerve pain, so much so that just scratching your arm (or wherever) sets you reeling. I learned from one of the fibro web sites that feeling excessively hot is a symptom of fibromyalgia. It also seems to be related to Epstein Barr Virus and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. No one really understands unless they have it or lives with someone who does. Years ago, a \"specialist\" prescribed 1800 mgs of magnesium, and that isn't a bad idea. However, I should have know to balance that with at least 3000 mgs of calcium. After 9 years of high doses of magnesium, I ended up with a leg fracture, which I learned is possible for people who treat fibro with high doses of magnesium.\nMark, off the top of my head, my best advice is to eat well--natural foods and no junk foods that are loaded with chemicals, do a LOT of stretching to keep your muscles moving and loose (very important), drink water, meditate on good things (because stress is a trigger), get plenty of protein, and I recommend a good protein shake that suits your needs (carbs? no carbs?). I'm not sure if I can give you brand names here, but I'm sure a decent vitamin store employee can guide you. I drink \"green drinks\" and I take a teaspoon of amino acid powder, plus I take more supplements than I can write here. That's up to you. If possible, you might want to see a doctor of natural medicine (not covered by insurance in New York though) and even an acupuncturist (my next move). I hope there's something here that is helpful to you. It's comforting to get to speaking with others who have fibromyalgia, even on a blog. You are not alone! I hope you get the proper help and be the best you can be!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/97298/heightened-senses-and-heat-skin-hypersensitivity"},{"post":{"author":"tiggerkat1244","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Strange Symptoms prior to Fibro Diagnosis?","post_content":"Did anyone experience strange symptoms over and above the normal ache and fatigue just prior to your Fibro diagnosis?

I'm starting to lose it emotionally and I'm reaching out to see if my thinking could be correct. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago when I went for a pain injection for back pain. I cannot take most of the prescription drugs due to allergic reactions. Pretty much just norco for pain and that is prescribed by my Orthopedic for degenerative disc disease. Lately, I am suffering from chronic UTI's and body aches like the flu. Fatigue, ha! My PCP diagnosed me with chronic fatigue but doesn't like to talk about why. She is more focused on my colonoscopy than anything else. Insists that the UTI's are coming from low estrogen since I had a full hysterectomy at 40. I am now 52 and just now having UTI problems? Well I found a common denominator with the symptoms. I work a seasonal job and the flare ups are around this period. The body aches like the flu are new though. I have to have naps to be able to get through a day. I've had sleep studies to be told I have periodic limb movement probably resulting from my back. Can stress cause the flare ups? All last summer, I relaxed in a campground and napped every day. I didn't have the symptoms I have now (just finishing seasonal job). My hubby is really getting worried because I am not able to do much before I get extremely exhausted (even showering takes a toll on the body).

I have a lot to say and hope by reading this that it is helping you.\nFood plays a tricky part in all of this. A lot of the medications, especially the pain meds and the psych meds, interfere with how our bodies break down food as well as toxins. It is imperative to pay attention to the signals your body is sending. If you are feeling full all the time with little to no appetite you need to talk to your doctor. If your skin or eyes become yellow you need to get to an emergency room. You MUST drink a lot of water. Our kidneys and liver are easy targets for the breakdown of the medications to damage. If you are not drinking enough water or your body isn't having regular bowel movements you are at risk for severe damage. How often is a normal bowel movement? You should be having at least one a day, every day. Certain pain meds can cause you have to have severe chronic constipation. When that happens the food and toxins you ingest do not move through the system. As they break down they release poison into the body. Over time this can make you even more sick than you already feel. This can even cause permanent damage if it goes on too long. I said before that I spent five years in great stomach pain all due to the medications shutting down my digestive system. I now suffer the consequence of that in having damaged kidneys and a very slow metabolism. I had to advocate for myself and refuse certain medications. I had to learn from nutritionists what my body can process and how to slowly rebuild my system. It has been a year now from that monumental situation and I am just starting to reap the benefits.\nSince I brought it up allow me a moment to discuss the medications. Almost everyone I have ever come across when they experience pain, especially ongoing chronic severe pain just want it to stop by any means necessary. Please do not be disheartened by what I am about to say. Nothing you do will ever make the pain you are enduring go away. That is an incredibly difficult thing to accept but it is undeniably true. The pain killers they give you, the opioids, will reprogram your brain and ultimately make your pain worse. That is not going to be a popular statement but it is a true one. So what does that mean? Understanding and accepting that pain is now a part of your life will take you much farther along the path to finding those ways that will help. Help in this sense is more about understanding your good days and your bad days, communicating your needs to those around you, educating others, advocating for yourself, and finding your path to peace. This sounds like nonsense doesn't it? I know, sounded that way to me too at first. Until the meds almost killed me.\nTime to get a little uncomfortable, if you are ready. I was on a little triangle of medications that created synthetic heroin. Yep, heroin. Ain't that something? I was on Lyrica, Percocet, and Soma for pain and spasm management. I was also on Effexor (venlafexine) and Lamictal (lamotrigine) for the psychological effects of long term diagnosis for chronic pain. The first three created the heroin. I would literally sleep for days. When I did wake up I felt incredibly sick all the time. Once I took my medications I would feel better for a short while until it was time to take meds again. If I missed any doses due to being asleep the sick cycle would start back up. The psychotropics were for \"severe depression.\" Of course I was depressed in the beginning! Who wouldn't be? Instead of helping through therapy I was given drugs that I did not need. These all combined in my body and my brain to wreak havoc. It was by accident that this cycle was broken. I had a doctor that took me off the Soma and shortly after due to a screw up in writing the prescriptions the Percocet wasn't sent out on time which led to withdrawal. Now I am not advocating that anyone go through this without having medical oversight. It was awful as anyone who has experienced it can tell you. Once I was through it I realized that I was feeling a lot better. Yes, I was still in pain and yes, I still had fibro. I just wasn't sick all the time.\nThen came the psych meds. I had spent the last year on them feeling incredibly suicidal. I did not reach out for help. I did not talk to my family. I just had all these horrible thoughts in my head all of the time. I truly thought about dying every day. After I was no longer on the synthetic heroin I discovered that Effexor and Lamictal if given to those who do not have a correct mental health diagnosis can experience suicidal tendencies. For me, I made the decision to come off of them. I cannot tell you that it is wise for you to do the same. That is something you have to do decide and you have to talk to someone about. For me, and my situation it was the best thing I have done in a very long time. I want to make it absolutely clear though that these decisions should be made through wise counsel.\nNow that I am no longer on these meds I have designed a regimen of things that help me a lot. I have made a concerted effort to wake up at the same time every day. I do simple stretches, simple exercises, and spend time constructively. If I am having a terrible pain day, I slow down, accept that I am in pain, communicate with others, and practice patience.","like_count":"3","tags":["Living With"]},"responses":[{"author":"retiredcombatvet","resp_time":"10 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Lessons Learned from Fibro Pt. 2","resp_content":"very well put, vegasvet.

I was diagnosed with this and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or CFS in 2012. At that time there was not a lot of information out there and even fewer doctors who had come across this. I was initially sent to a psychiatrist for \"behavioral modification\" in order to address this as it was much more commonly thought to be a psychiatric disorder instead of a neurological one. Thankfully the consensus has changed and there are more out there that do recognize this as a physical entity with overlapping mental health aspects. I will discuss more of the mental health in a moment. First I would like to take a moment to talk about the physical portion.\nI am not a doctor nor am I a scientist, however, there are a lot of things that I have tried and there are a lot of things that I have observed. Please understand that what I present to you are all things that have not been \"scientifically\" proven. Also, what works for one may or may not work for all so please, use your own best judgement in response to anything you read in my posts. Now that the \"official\" stuff is out of the way I will start in.\nI have noticed that there are certain similarities among those that have experienced this illness. The first is that a significant back or spinal injury has happened to most. Illnesses such pneumonia, hepatitis, mono, staph infections, and other invasive types have occurred within ten years prior to a back injury that predates the onset of fibro. Fibro mimics lupus, MS, and at times parkinsons, as well as transient ischemic attacks. The major differences in these illnesses between fibro and the others is that the others show up on medical tests. I will say again that what I am saying are only observances that I have made. I do not have any correlating evidence. There may be a link in the way that fibro comes about. I am purely speculating that there is a potential genetic predisposition that becomes activated when an injury occurs that leaves the spinal fluid/cord exposed to an infection that then triggers the illness. Once the illness is triggered the body's response becomes one of almost continuous activation of the adrenalin hormone in the brain which can then rewrite how the respondent nerve endings process pain signals. This could explain why when we are in pain it is difficult to process higher thinking such as problem solving, complex communication, or complex emotional response sequences. This is only a theory.\nI have many in the medical profession who have told me that fibro is not a progressive illness yet I have many occasions where in my symptoms become much worse and then lighten up. Over the years the \"episodes\" I have experienced have increased not only in duration but in intensity. I have gone from being able to be fairly active to partially paralyzed and bed bound then back to active. I have had temporary blindness at one extreme and severe light sensitivity at the other. My body can go from being painfully sensitive to touch so much so that just wearing clothes is too much all the way to being completely numb no matter what the stimulus. I have repeatedly been tested for everything under the \"sun\" to determine a \"true\" diagnosis with the medical community coming up with blanks. This is incredibly frustrating as well as baffling. If you are in this position understand that you are not alone in this. You are not imagining things and yes your body is doing it's best to confound you.\nOn the bright side there are some good observations that just may help you out. Pay attention to the weather. When low pressures exist in the atmosphere you are more likely to feel the effects of fibro much more. When the pressure is high you have a good chance of feeling pretty good. Warm is better than cold but hot is too much. Try to find the balance that works best for you. Pay attention to the temperatures, the pressure, the amount of sun that makes you feel your best. Some that I know have found great relief in acupuncture, alpha stimulation, tens unit machines. Personally I have found that meditation, time in a heated swimming pool a couple of times a week, some yoga (fused so can only do a bit), tai chi, easy hikes, and socializing have helped me more than a lot of the drugs that get prescribed. Being active when it hurts can be a real challenge but trust me when I say that even a small amount of movement everyday will help much more than not. Don't try to climb Mt. Everest, set small goals and achieve them. I moved into a two story house with the simple goal of being able to use the stairs ten times in a day. Might not seem like much but it can be a lot on certain days!\nEat healthy and light. Not only can the medications upset how your body breaks down food fibro can do quite a tricky job as well. Experiment with different types of food to see what your body can work with. I spent five years in unbearable stomach pain due to not understanding how my digestion had changed. Pay attention to how food makes you feel. Pay attention to how much water you are drinking and your appetite. Talk to a nutritionist to help design a food plan that will help you. If you find that you are not eating or drinking a lot you need to reach out to your doctor. Those are warning signs you have to pay attention to. Also, be aware that pain does funny things do us. I have stood for ages in front of an open refrigerator door in great pain looking for something, anything that would help. Sounds stupid but it does happen.","like_count":"4","tags":["Medications","Living With","Symptoms","Daily Check-In","Home Remedies","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/92145/lessons-learned-about-fibro-pt-1"},{"post":{"author":"daughter109","post_time":"11 months ago","post_title":"Alternative or prescribed drugs opinion","post_content":"Hello, I’m attending Middle Georgia state is doing a research paper on fibromyalgia for my English lit 1102 class.

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).\nIn the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.\nI’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.\nShe referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.\nI went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks. He prescribed me a proton pump inhibitor, because in the last few months I’ve seen my conditions improve on/off with these (not sure if they’ve actually helped or not).\nAt this point, I’m just not sure where to turn. Seems I have a lot of the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (I also urinate frequently and have anxiety/depression over the situation), but I’m not convinced the chest pain is from that because for one I’m male (mostly females get Fibro), and secondly from what I’ve seen chest/armpit pain doesn’t normally line up with the normal Fibro pain spots.\nIf anyone has any ideas what may be going on here, I’d love to hear them.

My first question would be: is there any history of injury, strain or overuse of the left arm or shoulder? Do you have a particular habit that keeps the arm postured negatively (including computer work, games, hobbies)? The symptoms you listed would be congruent with a very subtle neuro-vascular and lymphatic impingement around the clavicular and lower cervical/ upper thoracic region. Such things wouldn't really surface on most scans, or be considered inherently pathological. It is not quite TOS (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome), but symptoms might fluctuate with your stress levels, posture, even diet and the weather. Do you notice that the symptoms worsen in particular positions or situations? And, if they improve under others? Without proper palpation and investigation of the muscular tissues and the anatomy in its entirety, it's hard to pinpoint what is involved, so I would suggest self-massage: start with the bicep of the arm, and work your way up through the neck, into the arm pit (where the subscapularis is housed), and even into the jaw. Do some arm stretches, and rotate the arm from the deltoid, and try to \"open\" the tight spots, should there be any. Get the pectoral major and minor. Unfortunately, this could also result from transmitted tension from the posterior aspect of the scapula, so proper intervention from an acupuncturist (who does cupping, guasha and other bodywork) could be more profitable than more lab tests (and I'm glad nothing alarming came back for you). -@jcmlac\n"},{"author":"billyross","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: I have no idea what's wrong with me","resp_content":"I had the same problem years ago.

I guess my story is probably similar to many of yours. For the best part of these 10 years I was in the most awful state imaginable. I was close many times to just run the car into the next tree and make this misery an end. I have had gabapentin, Cymbalta and many other drugs that did not help me at all, if anything the side effects made it even less worth living. We emigrated and so got a new doctor. Although he really tried to help but I guess he didn't know how. However during one check-up he had a flash of inspiration and prescribed me Arnica-Betula compound drops - yes a homeopathic remedy - and yes I went home in tears, thinking what a waste of money but low and behold no more burning muscles in my body and the fibro fog had also disappeared - a miracle in my eyes. A little bit later he put me on Spiricort for something completely unrelated but it worked for the Fibro, the arthritis in the whole of my spine, and all the destroyed discs too. And by accident I discovered that a protein shake in the morning made a massive, massive difference to me. I actually have now a bit of get up and go- something I could only dream of before. In the last 2 months I have been able to clean and sort out my whole house- something I am really proud of having achieved. Without the help of the drops, the tablets and the shakes totally impossible. I also take the vit D3 of course, when necessary i.e. when my bones hurt. I am now able to work 55% and on my days off I go walking with our dog - something I have not been able to do without screaming in pain afterwards, for a long long time. Although I know I am not healed but these measures made life worth living for me. I am thinking of trying Ginko for my brain - my short term memory is atrocious.

I have had fibro for 19 years, finding an effective med to control your pain is a tedious method of just trying different meds or combinations of meds. You have not even touched on the multitude of meds used to treat the symptoms. Commonly prescribed are just about any anti-depressant, muscle relaxers, arthritis drugs to name a few categories. I am sorry to break it to you but there is no magic bullet, you can expect to need 2-3 meds at one time. From my research that seems to be the most common theme with successful control. Very important The combination of meds that worked the longest for me was Savella and Lyrica. Unfortunately after a number of years the Lyrica started causing me problems and I had to go off it. Eventually I was feeling better and discontinued the Savella. I actually had a few years of only minor flareups that would go away quickly. 18 months ago a severe flare up started. Nothing has helped and I was so desparate I started exercising since I have read just about everywhere that it helps. It is the hardest thing to do with severe pain over my entire body but I could not stand the pain with no relief. My goal was everyday knowing I would miss some days. After about 3 months(yes a very long time) I noticed that although the pain is still pretty bad, it is worse on the days I don't do any exercise. I still need to find a doctor and new meds to cut the pain down more but right now a little relief is better than no relief.

I am getting desperate & I can only imagine how my husband feels.\n\nMy husband has had roaming joint pain for maybe five years now. It will move from his left elbow to his right foot to his right middle finger without reason. This used to occur sporadically - maybe once a month to once every two months & last from a few hours to a few days. He was also extremely fatigued, napping every day after work & every weekend. He did seem to feel sick more than \"the average person\" as well with headaches & flu like symptoms often.\n\nIn the past two years it has gotten extremely worse. There have been virtually no breaks in the pain. Some days he can barely walk after getting out of bed. Let me say that he is fairly healthy, in his 40's & not remotely overweight (6 feet, 170 pounds). This now seems to be affecting not only his joints but also his tendons & fascia. He will have swelling above one of his knees (also red & warm), his finger will swell to almost twice it's size & occasionally he will be unable to bend his wrist or straighten his finger. The pain/swelling is still roaming - there seems to be no rhyme or reason to where it will show up.\n\nHe is still exhausted. It is hard for him to get up for work & he is down for a nap as soon as he gets home from work. It is not unusual for these naps to last through the night. He naps most of the weekend as well. He is also now in pain while he is sleeping/laying down. He will often moan during the night & last night I found him in the chair because it hurt too bad to lie down.\n\nOn the days that he does wake up feeling ok, it is usually short lived & he will be back in pain before the end of the day. His blood test have come back normal for the most part. He has been tested for Lyme disease a few times & it has been negative. The only thing that tested positive (once) was ANA. The rheumatologist however said that was inconclusive.\n\nWe've been less than pleased with the 2 rheumatologist we have seen - they seem to blow this off. Our GP has been great, but there doesn't seem to be much he can do other than refer us to a rheumatologist. It is very frustrating to see him in this much pain & not have a plan of action. He has almost given up on doctors. I just cannot imagine him having to suffer for the rest of his life.\n\nThere has got to be something that can be done, but we just have not been able to diagnose this. I am hoping that someone will recognize these symptoms & be able to give us their experience.

I had to leave work that day, and called my Rheumatologist. He snarled \"all you people are calling me today, and the truth is, every time the barometer rises or falls, you're gonna feel like crap and there's nothing I can do about it!\" So I thanked, him, hung up, and later got another doctor. Then I bought a barometer, and learned how to read it. I never look at it, unless I feel a lot of pain, and can't figure out why. Then I read the barometer, and if it is rising or falling, I can shrug and go \"Well, it's just the weather, I can handle this.\" Then I take, with my current doctor's permission, one extra dose of mild pain meds and 1/2 my sleep pill, and go take a nap. Usually, that helps. I learned how to read it with the help of a nice Coast Guard man.\nI live in Nevada, up in the mountains, so the heat is not as bad here as in Las Vegas. I set the barometer for our altitude, and that tells me what is happening. If you live near any Coast Guard station, they would probably teach you how to set it, and later, read it. Obviously, that's not the total answer. I just use it as a coping mechanism. We have so many things to fight. I fight IBS with two tablets of a drug called Lomotil, taken first thing in the morning, and then I DON'T eat for two hours. After that, my stomach is pretty calm. But my form of IBS is \"always on fast forward.\" It can alternate, or be troubled by constipation.\nAt least, I can take care of that problem, too. I won't recommend any other kind of medication, as no one medication works for all of us. I came down with this at age 42. I am now 80. At least, this illness doesn't seem to shorten our lives.\nOn Amazon, there are several movies about this illness. Also, books about Fibro. I have \"Fibromyalgia for Dummies\" and a cookbook for Fibro. I have another book about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. It's pretty good too, and I've learned even more from it. It's called \"Caring for the ME Patient.\" We all need to keep being as informed as we can.

Here are a few things that have really helped to keep me feeling good (after years of trial and error):\n1. Vitamin B - THIS IS A MUST...take it every day!!!! (If you travel take it with you.) FYI, if you feel tired also you may want to include an iron supplement but check with your doctor.\n2. Stress level - No matter what, you have to reduce your stress or else you WILL have a flare up. Your muscles/nerves will go hay-wire and cause you to feel sick and tired. So, if you know you have a big project to complete, do the project but make sure to allow your body to rest the following day.\n3. Stretch- as soon as you wake up in the morning stretch your body all over for a few minutes. This really helps to losen the muscles.\n4. Drink LOTS of water. This helps to keeps toxins from building up in the muscles and prevent aches/pains.\n5. Diet - Yes, I gave up soft drinks and reduced my sugar intake. (Also, I don't eat beef or pork but that is my personal decision.)\n6. Exercise - get good/consistent exercise but don't overdo it. Sometimes if I went hard at the gym, I've gotten a flare up and got sick all over again (aka- Gym Flu).\n7. Try YOGA!!!! This practically saved me. You will feel so much better. But, be careful if you have High Blood Pressure (do NOT do the heated yoga).\n\nHere is something you need to know about REST. Be very careful, because sometimes you will think \"I just need to lay in bed and get more rest, but I found that \"bed-rest\" actually stiffens the muscles more. Yes, you do need to get rest, but do NOT lay in bed all day because it often makes it worse. Instead, go for a short walk outside.

They said I could resign for medical reasons instead of them saying I couldn't do the job and a letter stating that that they were not giving me a contract was because I couldn't do the job. Even though they knew I was under doctors care for the accident. After jumping through insurance company hoops I had spinal fusion and disc replacement surgery in December and slow recovery the twitching in my toes and feet is worse than ever and some days my back hurts so bad I can hardly stand up. I now have no insurance and no job and to make matters worse the day after surgery my mother suddenly got sick and passed away. She was disabled and on home dialysis and I was her sole caretaker but she was in relatively good health given her problems and we had just seen her specialists. But my feet burn and twitch and I can't tolerate cold due on the Raynaud's. And my feet don't sweat they never have I remember in college getting up at night and going into the dorm bathroom and sitting on the counter to put my feet in the sink to run cool water on them.","like_count":"1","tags":["Medications","Living With","Symptoms","Daily Check-In","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"rollinggirl","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: I have foot pain too...","resp_content":"First and foremost I'm sorry for the loss of your Mother. I read your post several times picking it apart, but I think what you are describing in your feet is neuropathic pain. This is generally associated with diabetes , but doesn't have to be. The twitching can be controlled with medications, as can the burning and pain.\n\nI've been through the no insurance no job routine, I know how hard it is to get proper treatment. The first thing I would suggest would be to find out what programs there are for the disabled in your area. Apply for everything. If they deny you, reapply. If you can't go back to work apply immediately for Social Security. When doing so it is easiest to hire a S.S. lawyer. They cost you nothing up front and nearly guarantee you will get your benefits.\n\nMost of all.

Did they check you for Celiac Disease? That is a simple blood test too and that needs to be checked fairly often because most people with Fibro tend to get it and if not treated, which is just a change in diet, it can cause all sorts of problems.

I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot).

If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better?

Even the biopsy came back stating there was “bacteria” present in the tissue but they didn’t even stain it to ascertain what type. They diagnosed “drug reaction” (to what drug? No idea)\n\nDespite being an RN with a BSN, I did not know about Lyme disease then.\nBTW you sound educated but you do sound condescending and like you are “blaming” me and assuming many things without asking for the information first.\n\nI developed widespread pain, fatigue peripheral neuropathy and severe depression and anxiety within the next couple years. I don’t remember the tick bite, but the rash itself I now know is diagnostic for Lyme- almost nothing else causes that kind of red, round expanding rash that clears in the center, and about 50% of people with Lyme don’t get the rash or it’s too mild to notice.\n\nI was diagnosed with “fibromyalgia”. I now believe that a large percentage of people diagnosed with FM actually have Lyme because I person know about 8 personally, and many dozens online.\n\nIn 2001, I showed the pic of the EM rash to my neurologist and he ordered the standard crap ELISA test which has a 56% false negative rate (that means that if you have 100 people with Lyme disease and you do this ELISA test on all 100, 56 will come back negative.) It’s a very bad screening test- in what field of anything is a false negative rate of 56% acceptable?? Yet that is what the CDC recommends. And what traditional doctor are taught to order. In my case, the cutoff for “negative” was 0.99 and my value was 0.95.\n\nSo I went on, getting worse and worse over time, still thinking I had fibro and I just had to live with it. In 2005 I started with a pain management doc for the extreme pain and ended up dependent on fentanyl patches for 7 years and then Opana and now morphine. (Jumping ahead, now that I’ve had proper and very expensive treatment for Lyme, Ehrlichiosis and Babesia, my pain is much less and since Sept I have been tapering off the pain meds to the point where I am now on half what I used to be 6 months ago (now 150mg/day) and plan to go lower- but I suffer insomnia and anxiety withdrawal symptoms for 10-14 days with every decrease.)\n\nI was tested again with the ELISA test from my family doc in 2013 and again it came back negative.\n\nIn April 2015 I crashed and became non functional and couch- bound- not that I was doing much by this time anyway. But now I could do nothing- no cooking, cleaning, going out, going to church- nothing. Still thinking I had fibro, I sought treatment with a “specialist” who works by phone. When I sent him my info and he saw the pic of the rash, he knew to test me with the Western Blots thru iGeneX labs in California. They came back with 7 bands- positive even by CDC standards- and the first Lyme dr I consulted said I was “strongly positive for active, ongoing infection” even after 20 years.\n\nThis Dr was a days drive in California as I could not find a Lyme specialist in AZ then. Finally in Aug 2016 I found my Lyme Literate dr, a naturopath, in Phoenix (100 miles away) and began much better treatment. Of which almost none is covered by insurance. I’m slowly getting better, complicated by the opiate tapering (which was my idea).\n\nSo, yeah, I didn’t stupidly sit by and not do ANYTHING—as you ignorantly implied. I was a victim of uneducated and mis-educated doctors and an infectious disease that the government and insurance companies refuse to recognize in anything but the acute stages.\n\nLyme and co-infections stole my 40’s and 50’s and my RN career. I do my best to educate people about Lyme and how to get proper testing. I am batting 1.000 (6 for 6) for people who I thought had Lyme, encouraged them to get properly tested, and all 6 had Lyme- 5 of whom were diagnosed with “fibromyalgia”. And scores of people who I hope I have helped online.\n\nSo lrose, I hope you now realize that I’m not an idiot.\n\nCheck out the accurate information about Lyme disease and co-infections on the websites I listed in my other post, if you have any questions about these infections. Don’t believe what the CDC says. This is a silent pandemic being largely ignored and many are suffering needlessly and going bankrupt. The suicide rate among Lyme sufferers is much higher than the national average. And I read a report where people who had had both cancer (treated) and Lyme disease (eventually treated) said that the experience with the Lyme, both the illness and the treatments, were much worse than the cancer.\n"},{"author":"lroseneuropsych","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Fibro Questions","resp_content":"Hi there,\n\nI recognize that I'm a little late here, but your post caught my eye when it was referenced in WebMD's \"Chronic Pain\" e-mail newsletter this afternoon.\n\nMany thanks for providing a brief history, and for being so thorough. It sounds like you've done a fair amount of research here, and you're absolutely right to seek out a second opinion if you feel you've been incorrectly diagnosed.\n\nYou mentioned that an MRI of your lower back showed physiological cause for your chronic back pain and, irrespective of whether or not the condition was exacerbated by one or more of those vehicle collisions, I think it's safe to say they probably didn't help. If you don't already have one, have your provider write you a physiatrist referral. A physiatrist would be the best-qualified specialist to examine your back and, from there, recommend the most appropriate treatment course, be it physical therapy, surgery, or otherwise.\n\nInsofar as the sleep apnea goes, while fibromyalgia does cause sleep disturbance, it's more in the realm of profound, chronic insomnia. With that in mind, it's probably an unrelated comorbidity, but a dangerous one at that, as is any disorder that causes cessation of breathing. If your insurance is taking care of the sleep study, there's really no reason not to go ahead with it; however, if your husband has observed that your breathing intermittently stops throughout the night, or if you recall ever waking up, gasping for oxygen, you have your diagnosis. I would recommend scheduling a consultation with an ear, nose & throat (ENT) specialist (an otorhinolaryngologist) to examine the airway and determine the best way to mitigate the blockage. If you still have your tonsils, your ENT may recommend having them removed, especially if they appear cryptic, inflamed, or otherwise enlarged.\n\nAnd, finally, let's talk cephalalgias, because the word \"cephalalgia\" is infinitely more fun to say than \"headache.\" Unfortunately, even though we can make it sound better linguistically, migraine is migraine, and I regret that you seem to have the full gamut of symptoms. The unilateral eyelid edema and the intermittent \"ice pick,\" or stabbing headaches are symptomatic of migraine. I would definitely consult with a neurologist about botulinum toxin injections for migraine, if you haven't already-clinical evidence shows overwhelmingly positive results.\n\nSo, based solely on the information you've provided, I would have to respectfully disagree with your practitioner's diagnosis of fibromyalgia.\n\nOf course, we use non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsants (e.g. topiramate, divalproex sodium/valproic acid, pregabalin, etc.) in the treatment of both migraine and fibromyalgia, and migraine is a highly prevalent symptom of fibromyalgia. With that in mind, and taking into account your back injury, your doctor may have diagnosed you with fibromyalgia intentionally, so as to ensure that you won't run into any issues obtaining the medications you may need for the management of your symptoms going forward.\n\nBest of luck with everything, and feel free to reach out anytime if there's anything I can do for you.\n\nWarmly,\n--Lucas\n"},{"author":"tidewatch","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Fibro Questions","resp_content":"Dear Armewify - From your description, I don't think you have Fibromyalgia.

And a rheumatologist's theory is as well-founded as that of an internist because, the sad fact is: the medical community, as a whole, just isn't there yet.\n\n--L\n"},{"author":"cajunkaty","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Fibro Questions","resp_content":"I’ve had fibromyalgia since my early 20s.

I finally made an appointment with a holistic doctor and got the meds I needed. I'm cured!!! Google: candidiasis symptoms. You will find most all your summons on the list. Most common is fatigue and wide spread pain, but brain fog, dry mouth, dry eyes, dry skin, etc., are also symptoms of the disease. I've been in medical school, and the knowledge I've accumulated helped me diagnosis myself, or I world still be sick.

I have severe fatigue too and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and hypersomnia...all after a bad car accident 8 years. I've taken a cardiopulmonary test and was definitively diagnosed with the chronic fatigue due to my test results. Before my son (he's 2.5yr now), I was sleeping 11-14 hours a night with naps most days too. There were times when I'd sleep 18-22 hours a day! Needless to say, it's been a depressing struggle. Anyway, the only thing that reasonably *sort of* helps me is a medicine called modafinil and knowing when to say no to doing things. I've tried pretty much everything for my fatigue but here are some ideas from what I tried...just because they didn't all work for me, doesn't mean they wouldn't work for you! So, here's some ideas... acupuncture, herbs, meds (modafinil, adderall, methylphenidate), supplements, diet changes (Whole Foods and elimination diet included), essential oils, CAFFIENE lol, homeopathic stuff, reiki, massage, meditation, sleep hygiene (no devices in bed, go to sleep at the same time every night, keep room somewhat on the cooler side, keep bed for just sleeping and sex, etc), Low impact exercise (walking, resistance bands, etc) in the morning, trying to lower stress levels lol, B vitamin shots, etc. Unfortunately, fatigue is so incredibly debilitating and most people don't even understand (or even try to) AND it's a tough one to treat! Have you been open with you doctor about your fatigue? Sleeping that much is something that greatly and adversely affects your quality of life. Hopefully you have a decent doctor who'll take you seriously and get you the needed blood work (CBC, fill thyroaod pan, vitamin d levels, iron, etc) too. I really hope you find some relief because I understand 100% just how hard dealing with disabling fatigue is on a daily basis.

And even then, that becomes a competition to others of who's pain is worse (on their behalf). Since there are still so many unanswered questions about fibromyalgia, people still lack compassion for those whom suffer. People tend to fear or rebuke what they don't understand. I know my response to your message doesn't help but I just wanted to say I UNDERSTAND. You're certainly not alone in this. It's tough when it's our family, the people we trust, that lack compassion or sympathy for us when we're in pain. Unfortunately, some people (including doctors) still have the old school train of thought about it being psychosomatic or just a result of depression. They tell you to toughen up and just think more positively or *simply* get more sleep and take vitamins. Until something truly concrete comes out about the cause of fibromyalgia, then there will always be naysayers. We have to just remain true to ourselves and have compassion for ourselves. It's important to not take those negative said things personally because they are directed at us but most of that is out of ignorance or people trying to give us their (misguided) advice or interpretation of tough love.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/35495/fibromyalgia-unbelievers"},{"post":{"author":"rosemarycobain81","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Any clue?","post_content":"Hello everyone!\n\nSo, I’ve been experiencing some symptoms for quite some time that can resemble a number of posibilities.

There is no reason to hold back on the trauma as it will be published I hope One day called Victim.I was actually wrote I love use at the age of 13 and kept it to myself for 34 years trying to leave the Earth because of what happened. Then I decided to wean myself off the medication and turn my life around and then out came fibromyalgia. I went to my GP is they could not be bothered to even check out my symptoms and just piled in so much morphine upon me I ended up in a chronic condition yet again. I had to self diagnose myself over a three day period ruling out everything that could possibly be causing the pain I was horrified when I found out that it was fibromyalgia and slammed down the document in front of my GP Dr Keil and even he could not be bothered to sort out the problem medication which I’m on now call gabapentin. I note that all of you are taking different medication out there but the suffering that I’m in during the fact that none of the GPs in Wales in UK bother to even instruct or help me makes my life even more difficult.

My typical days before taking this was spent in unbelievable pain and burning all over. It felt like all the pain nerves in my back was radiating a burning pain all over my body. We have all tried the diff meds they but us on that never work. I started feeling like a lab rat. Nothing worked.

I have not went a day without it since I started. Afraid to get that pain back! I was diagnosed in 93 with fibro and suffered for so many years with it.

All wrong.\nWhat they are not telling you.\nThere are treatments for Chronic Pain....Lidocaine Infusions\n6 treatments a year and covered OHIP\n\nTreatment\nMany patients start off their journey with fibromyalgia by seeing their primary care physician. After a thorough work-up, these general practitioners usually send patients to doctors who specialize in pain conditions. One possible physician you may encounter would be a rheumatologist, particularly if rheumatoid arthritis or lupus is suspected. In most cases, the patient will be treated for the chronic pain condition by a pain management physician, and they will coordinate other treatments in conjunction with the primary care doctor.\nThe front line treatment for fibromyalgia by pain management doctors is medications. As mentioned above, antidepressants are often prescribed for mood adjustment, but they are also quite effective in relieving pain. Cymbalta is an anti-depressant that has been studied and found to be effective in treating the pain of fibromyalgia. In addition, anti-seizure medications, such as Lyrica, can also help with the fibromyalgia pain. Muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, are also used to control pain. By combining these medication types, most patients experience pain relief.\nOpioids are not generally used for fibromyalgia because they tend not to decrease the specific pain of the condition. A special intravenous infusion called a Meyer’s cocktail has shown some promise in helping patients with their pain. It is a blend of several vitamins and nutrients that can correct imbalances in the body. Of course, the treatment for fibromyalgia doesn’t stop at medications. Pool therapy, physical therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, and chiropractic care are all viable adjuncts to medications, and your pain management physician can help you navigate your choices to select the treatment that is right for you.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"giseledegrace","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: FIBRO AND CHRONIC PAIN","resp_content":"Not sure who you are, but you clearly know nothing about Fibromyalgia\n"},{"author":"giseledegrace","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Leaky gut my friend covers many things.

I scratch in my sleep as well and always have small scabs. I use lubricating lotion with shea butter in it, or sometimes an OTC cortisone cream. Diversion helps. I changed my detergent to \"Free 'n Clear\". It all helps a little.

My doctors office I go too saw the main Dr. on my first visit but then after that you see his PA or NP. They make us all sit in a room after being seen to wait for the main Dr. come sign the prescriptions so we can go. The main Dr. is busy in the back part of the building doing spinal injections and comes out in between patients to sign the prescriptions for us and they label that as being seen by the Dr. I have tried and tried to get out of that office before they kill me but no other,offices will let me move to them for some unknown reason. They state that after reviewing my records they would not be able to offer any me any other additional treatment than what I am currently receiving and deny my transfer. Once you are seen by a pain management facility in my area you can't stop and then go back again so I can't make my move that way or have my fibro dr refer me to a new facility so my hands are tied. I have to constantly remind them that I have fibro only to be told they don't treat fibro even though the dr told me they do twice. A couple months ago I went for my visit and out of the blue she dropped my dosage down and when I asked why she said I was taking a benzo and I couldn't take them together even though I have been taking the same mess for two years. She wrote in my chart that I got upset when my dosage was changed without saying I just wanted a explanation of why. I told her I had not been taking that benzo in months and even then it was as needed. I have never asked to be increased I just tell them how I feel and let them tell me what I need. The very next visit she asked me have you quit taking the benzo I tried to explain again but added that I flushed them. She then said that she was going to take me off my pain meds completely so I asked why. She said because I wasn't getting enough benefit out of it and then said you look the best I have ever seen you look and I said that is because I take the pain meds and that I was having a goo day.Geez!

So with this very long post I would like to know if anyone has info on what they are trying to do with the issue. It seems like they are trying to make it so expensive to have medication that we will have to go without it so then the opiod delima will be taken care of.

It took 2 or 3 months plus an extended trip out of town for me to realize how much dry needling was helping. The 10-hour car ride usually leaves me hurting, but I didn't feel too bad that time. Then there were severe storms in the area for several days, which would usually cause me bodily pain and migraines. Others with arthritis were really hurting, but I didn't feel too bad. This occurred during a very stressful time, aside from there being a death in the family. Unfortunately, I've had to discontinue all therapies due to my husband being unemployed for several months.

I had what I like to call the Christmas tree effect going on in my body. Whenever the barometric pressure had a significant change, say a Hurricane was getting ready to form in the Gulf of Mexico. Then crash into another Hurricane brewing in the Atlantic off the Coast of GA. I knew something big was coming before the weather man said a word. My body flipped those rotating Christmas lights on, as if the darn Elf on the shelf had them on turbo. My pain would jump from one spot to the other. Then to kick it up a notch. It would feel like lightening bolts were shooting out of my toes. Initially when this all started, I thought the ground wire for our house had an issue. But that was immediately checked off the list, because I was the only person with the problem. At first I thought it was all in my head, and simply wouldn't acknowledge the pain.\nI've had one back surgery. I have no hardware as I was very clear with the first surgeon. Get it done on this go around. I'm only doing this one time.\nI've done PT along with water therapy. For me, my problem is I have a crazy high threshold for pain. With the additional issue that no form of pain medication has been able to ease the pain period. I have pain everyday all day. So, I simply don't take real pain medication. Morphine has zero effect on me. None. The others upset my stomach so bad, I'd rather be in pain. So, what can you do for pain? If you stay in bed all day, that makes your pain go through the roof. If you sit all day, the same problem. Walking and standing in place also cause an issue. So you have to find a balance. When my pain is so bad I don't think I can handle it one more minute. I clean and do laundry. For me, movement helps ease the pain. Keeping blood moving to all the injured parts of the body helps. Along with hot showers or baths. Heating pads. Etc. Mix it up. Going to a Pain Psychologist also helped. I'm able to mind over matter my pain. It takes patience and practice. But it can be done. I've been dealing with my back issue for almost 20 years. I've had my amazing Pain Management Doctor for 13 years. It's hard to give control to your doctor. I was really stubborn at first. Then I began to trust my her. She has helped me so much over these 13 years. You have to be willing to try different forms of treatment. I've been willing to do everything to easy my pain. Except take any medication that has Oxy in it or cotin as the end. I've never had the meds and never will. Some form of movement and a positive mental attitude also helps. Never ever give up.

I had my first disc fusion surgery in 2009 and was taking hydrocodeine for my pain. I was good for about a year then went thru a horrifying event in Feb. 2011, my husband committed suicide by hanging and I found him.....my life turned upside down as you could imagine. So I didn't have but five days to grieve before I had to pack up my whole house and move. I had no job, limited money let's just say it was the absolute worst experience in my life. I don't know if that's when I hurt my back again but I wound up going back on hydrocodeine. I had second disc fusion surgery April 2014 felt great then went back for my four week check up and my doctor told me the screws were backing out of the hardware and I needed immediate surgery again to correct it so I had the third disc fusion surgery May 2014. I was still taking hydrocodeine but I never got better or really recovered from the last surgery. So I was in constant unbearable pain, was crying constantly, I knew something was off with me I just didn't know so I did some internet searching and that's when it hit me I had Fibromyalgia so I scheduled a appointment with the best Rheumatologist in my area and we confirmed that's what was adding to my condition. I had my follow up appt. with my Neurologist he was not very understanding that my cervical spine was still hurting and that I was diagnosed with Fibro so he passed me off to Pain Mgmt. I was in tears the day I went there I was in so much pain so on my second visit I was still hurting and crying that's when I was given Morphine and on my third they added MS Contin because I was still hurting. One is long acting the other is fast acting, it did help me some so I have been on that same strength since then until last month. I was told the Dr. went to a conference and they were pushing the idea that if a pt was on a benzo they better be careful on the dosage they were prescribing, essentially he got scared. I have never asked for a increase in dosage or called asking for more I was getting some relief and I was determined to make it work for me. I am in a flare constantly since 2014 not getting a break but it does get worse at times. I think I have had fibro for several years possibly since 1996 is as far back as I can attribute my time missed from work, I was sick all of the time I thought I was just catching everybody's coodies but I went to the doctor about 12-15 times a year missing 3-5 days a week each time I got sick, it was flares I am sure. It all make sense now but had I not searched for my illness. Oh I forgot the last time I went to pain mgmt. I was informed I was given a benzo script (accidentally by my pharmacy) so they dropped the dosage,n one of my RX for pain because it was a benzo. I told them I wasn't taking it but they didn't care. My husband picked it up for me not knowing I quit taking it and my primary doctor sent it to pharmacy accidentally, but all of these issues was my fault, stupid doctors. She said you won't even notice the difference that's because she doesn't know what it's like to be sick and in pain everyday of your life, I just wish I could trade a few days with her so she could get a dose of my life. I have been hurting more this past month so I guess I did notice the difference after all. I wish I could find a new pain dr. But nobody will take me as they would not be able to assist me any different than my current dr, they didn't even give me a chance to explain why I wanted to move. They are all in together, I think. Anyway that's my story as long and miserable as it is. I do thank you for writing me, do you know of a good support group online to join? There isn't one in my area and I wouldn't make it to all meetings anyway so online works better for me. I just need to communicate with other fibro sufferers? Take care all.\nReply\nmaggiethedoglover\nover 2 years ago\nHello,\n\nI have had fibro for a good number of years now. After numerous visits to my doctor and a rheumatologist, it was determined that this terrible pain and depression was due to fibromyalgia. I was prescribed Cymbalta at first but it didn't help at all and neither did the next thing. of which I can't remember the name. Then a doctor in the walk-in clinic suggested Lyrica, 100mg. I felt asleep almost the moment after I took it and it helped with the pain, about 75% of it most times, unless I'm in a flare and then not much helps. About once or twice a year, I get a 30 day supply of Vicodin and that helps on the really bad days, but again, nothing is 100%. I also take an anti-depressant and an anti-anxiety. Stress is the enemy (one of many) and to be avoided at all costs, plus I was crying all of the time.\n\nMy doctor retired last December and I am on my second one since then. The first doctor told me I didn't have fibro since I didn't have the pressure points. Both my Internal Medicine doc who retire and the rheumy agreed that I had enough of the other markers that not having pressure points did not rule out fibro. The doc I have now is skeptical about the Vicodin and doesn't want to prescribe it. I am almost out so this should be interesting coming up.\n\nHang in there. Sending soft hugs your way.

I have discovered that Not living in an hot and humid climate works well or any climate with excessive humidity or weather that causes the barometer to go nuts helps. I am entering a new Fibromyalgia trial at then end of this week and hope to find a some answers. If you can.... find one in your area as it may help to limit the amount of medications and ease some of the pain.\n1\nReply\nmaggiethedoglover\nover 2 years ago\nPlease keep us posted on what you find during the trial. I will look for one near me but I cannot drive far without experiencing great pain. Also, does anyone have a good solution for leg pain at night? I either cannot fall asleep because they hurt so much (and twitch) or the pain wakes me up and then I am up for hours. Elastic stockings help sometimes but only a little. Walking around and vigorously rubbing my legs helps a bit too. I just want to get a good nights rest so I can get up at a reasonable hour. I gave up my water aerobics because they start an hour earlier and I have fallen into a bad habit of sleeping in. Soft hugs to all of you out there suffering from this horrible disease.\n\nLove, maggie\n1\nReply\nlizcameronalex\nover 2 years ago\nMaggie, have you tried Voltaren? It has really helped. Also a profession massage therapist I see has been great at helping but you have to make sure they understand Fibro. He is also an EMT. Also if you aren't sitting in a recliner with your legs in an up position give it a try as it can aide in the circulation. It's my lazy hour before bed.\n1\nReply\nmaggiethedoglover\nover 2 years ago\nThanks for your reply. What is Voltaren???? Does it replace Lyrica?\nReply\nlizcameronalex\nover 2 years ago\nActually it is a cream (prescription only) about $40 with ins. and it helps immensely. I don't use it everyday but when upper arms and shoulders are having a fit.\nReply\nmaggiethedoglover\nover 2 years ago\nThanks!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/18942/starting-fibro-meds"},{"post":{"author":"juliemecfs","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Me/cfs","post_content":"As a patient that suffers from the debilitating illness of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome also known as ME/CFS.

A long read, but see if you can figure it out! in need of answers :(","post_content":"Here's a little Journey of my health over the past couple months. I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced.\n\n*May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.)\nA few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.\n*June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way.\n*June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) \"brain fog\", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.\n*After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*.\nFrom June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms.\nI was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.\n*June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside.\n*June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist.\n*June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.\nA few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!!

Hopefully this comment will help you to feel a bit better... 1) A sinus infection is 'not' a brain infection! And it would sure stress you a bit more in thinking that it is. Of course there have been cases of severe chronic sinusitis causing secondary infection to spread toward the brain, this is highly unlikely and ONLY in severe situations where no treatment had been previously administered! One the other hand however, a severe sinus infection can have numerous horrible side effects like some of the symptoms you listed. i.e. Headache, blurred vision (in one or both eyes), dizziness, malaise (generally feeling unwell) pressure on the face/head/eyes etc. & this is but a few!

Hopefully I can help.\n\nEven tho you were \"tested\" for Lyme disease (it's never plural with an \"S\") it sounds like you have Lyme and probably one or more co-infections.\nThe testing that most traditional doctors use is very inaccurate. The first of a 2-test system, the ELISA test (or IFA or \"titer\") has a 56% false negative rate. What this means is, if you line up 100 people who actually have Lyme infection and give them all this test, 56 will come back negative when they really do have Lyme.\n\nYou can educate yourself by reading about Lyme at these websites:\n\nwww.lymedisease.org\nwww.ilads.org\nwww.columbia-lyme.org\n\nThe info on these sites is up to date and accurate, the stuff the CDC and government says is not always correct.\n\nAlso, please watch a movie called \"Under Our Skin\" from 2008, and the sequel from 2014. Google them and I think they are on YouTube and Netflix.\n\nI was MISDIAGNOSED with fibromyalgia for 20 years when I actually have Lyme disease and 3 other infections. I had the classic red ring bullseye rash in 1995, board certified dermatologists didn't know what it was. I had all-over pain-- joints, muscles, came and went in different places but all over mostly, extreme fatigue, depression, anxiety, mental confusion, problems with vision and hearing that come and go, memory problems -- you name it, I had it. Finally in 2015, after declining all those years, unable to work as an ER RN, and finally becoming non-functional, a fibro specialist saw a picture of the rash and knew to test me for Lyme with more accurate tests, and it came back \"strongly positive for active, ongoing Lyme infection\". I now have a Lyme specialist (ILADS trained) and have been in treatment for 1.5 years and I'm starting to get better.\n\nPlease read about Lyme and find a doctor to test you properly. You can get a Basic Lyme Panel thru iGeneX labs in Palo Alto, Calif (google them for contact info) Most traditional doctors will dismiss this as \"not FDA approved\" but the lab is certified and specializes in this. Also, a more accurate (and expensive) test is the urine PCR test thru DNA Connexions in Colorado. If you can afford this $500, it is worth every penny and accurate because it tests for the DNA of the pathogens (bacteria, Protozoa etc) whereas the Western Blot tests and ELISA/IFA tests look for antibody response of your immune system.\n\nBut Lyme infection is a CLINICAL diagnosis, made by an ILADS trained Lyme Literate doctor (MD or ND-naturopathic doctor) who is educated in the symptoms and history, and the tests are only to help confirm the diagnosis. Lyme is very complicated, controversial, difficult to treat past the acute phase (within a few weeks of the tick bite) and can be expensive as most insurance won't pay for it. But it IS treatable and there are many success stories.\n\nPlease don't follow in my footsteps (by the way, I was tested twice for Lyme (2001 and 2013) with the ELISA and it came back \"negative\" but that was a false negative. Look at the websites I gave you, learn all you can, and find the correct doctor to evaluate you.

So it really could be either Fibromyalgia or indeed stress and anxiety (I would still try the anxiety medication anyway because it might actually help. No use in worrying because worrying makes Fibromyalgia much worse if that's what you have!) Also, a Vitamin B deficiency can mess with your nerves so that is a possibility. When I had an issue with the electrical shock feelings and numbness, I started taking Vitamin B12 and it helped. It takes a long while to get that into your system if you're low on it, though.

I do not take any medications.\n\nI got an influenza at the end of 2015 with recurring infections after that for a while, then I never got back to normal.

I have always worked a physical job, for over 20 years I worked as a CNA in the hospital, so that involves a lot of lifting, etc. I have also worked retail over the years and for the last year and a half that is my current job. When the pain began early last year, I just assumed it was getting use to standing/walking on concrete floors all day and lifting a lot of heavy boxes though out my shift. Well over time the pain has only gotten worse and after talking to my NP about it over many months, she did the tender point test on a very bad day, to the point I told her to quit touching me because I was hurting so bad. So, I was diagnosed with Fibro a few months ago.\n\nDue to my health seeming to get worse from the pain and not getting any sleep because of it, my NP put me on Elavil starting me at a low dose and I am now built up from 10mg to 30mg at bedtime. I also take Alka Seltzer for pain and at one point was taking so much, my body was full of bruises from so much aspirin. I was told to cut it back to no more than 2 times a day as I had been taking it 4 to 5 times a day. She had put me on Gabapentin to help with the pain and after 2 months I quit taking them because they did not help at all. So, I am just taking the Elavil and Alka Seltzer for pain. The aspirin seems to take the edge of the pain off but not take the pain all away.\n\nI also have arthritis in my knee joints and I know that isn't helping. I have also noticed over the last 5-6 months that if I sit in one spot too long and get up that my left leg does not want to go. My mind is telling it what to do, but being able to put pressure on it because of the pain and lack of strength in it, it takes me a few minutes sometimes to get it going.\n\nOne of my concerns is, is this really Fibro? It seems that the pain is never completely gone, my level at its best is usually a 2 and at its worst a 10+. Over the last 2 weeks with today being one of those days, I was actually feeling good or so I thought and my pain suddenly jumped from about a 2 to a 10+, no warning, just boom!!! I was all but in tears but was at work working the register and had to continue to manage a smile and be pleasant as the Assist Manager was on break. As soon as she came back she noticed a change in my behavior and asked what was wrong and I told her that suddenly the pain became almost unbearable. I went and sat in the office and cried for 5 minutes because of the pain. One night last week when I got home from work the pain was just as bad and I almost drove myself to the ER to see if they had any better answers than Fibro being the issue. But it was the fear of maybe being kept there that kept me from going. I was eventually able to sleep and woke the next morning with my pain being about a 5-6.\n\nMy NP says with taking the Elavil, I should not be having this much pain. So I was wondering if others may have experienced the same things as I have shared here? Thoughts appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":["Symptoms","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"junembe","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: DIagnosed with Fibro Two Months Ago","resp_content":"No way is Elavil going to stop you from getting some fibro flares. I was diagnosed early in 2004, so that was 13yrs ago and I have tried it all. I will tell you this much, you will need to make managing your condition your number one priority. It sounds to me like you do have fibro. I'm 64, almost 65 and your case sounds like my history. I went through the first couple of years without a diagnosis but was pretty sure I had it as my mom and older sister had been dealing with the pain for several years and my sister had been diagnosed with fibro.\nI also have arthritis in my knees and I get regular Synvisc shots for it. The first thing I did after diagnosis was do all I could to get rid of any pain that I could actually assign a cause to.\nSo, now, advice on what has worked for me and what hasn't. I guess I will start with where I am now.\nFirst, my prescriptions; I take a 300mg Tramadol HCL ER once a day. I try to take it later in the day because I have my worst pain in the morning and need it to be at peak effectivity then. I also take 100mg of Trazadone at bedtime to help me sleep. Right now I am taking an imipramine (50mg) with the Trazadone for depression. I take prescription Folic acid (1mg). Those are the only prescriptions I take for the Fibro. I have high blood pressure and diabetes, both of which are well controlled with meds, diet and life style changes.\nI also take a cocktail of OTC pain meds. I take 2 regular strength (200mg) Ibuprofen and 2 extra strength acetaminophen (500mg), with breakfast. I repeat the same cocktail later in the day if I need it, and I almost always do. I found this cocktail regimen on my own due to extreme and desperate need, and it worked!! Imagine my surprise!! I have never heard of anyone else doing this but synergistically the 2 meds work very well together. I never have to go any stronger with the dosages but could occasionally without too much fear of damaging myself because the 2 drugs work differently and effect different organs in the body. As a CNA you are probably already aware of the bio logistics involved. My NP (who is absolutely great) has assured me that it is safe to continue with these meds for the foreseeable future. Of course I have my liver and kidney functions tested regularly. I also take a multiple vitamin, a magnesium and a vitamin D3 daily. I have been on this regimen for 2 yrs now and I am functioning the best I ever have since diagnosis. So, on to life style changes.\nI got a lawyer, got disability and quit working. I was never able to stand the pain while working. Just too much stress, physical and emotional involved with working. Let me stress this: STRESS is your enemy. Learn to use meditation, imagery, breathing exercises, cognitive functioning, the whole ball of wax...it works!!\nIt helps greatly to find something you can love doing. I started playing a guitar and singing. I never had been able to do music and I had always loved it. I participate and help lead a weekly jam session and I go to the local seniors dances. I very rarely dance because it will likely cause a flare, but I love listening to live music. Even just playing and singing can cause a flare if I'm not careful about sitting in one place to long. That is another thing to watch...don't do anything for too long at a time. Work for 20min at a time, and don't sit in any one position for too long, get up and stretch regularly. It really does work. Stretching exercises in the morning every morning are great too. Gently though, very, very gently. A positive attitude is the most important tool. This is my mantra, I know it by heart:\nSome days are better, Some days are worse\nLook for the blessing, Instead of the curse\nBe positive, stay strong, And get enough rest\nYou can't do it all, but you can do your best.\nI have gone thru the terrible, terrible flares. I've suffered thru the debilitating despair of the diagnosis. When you are told you have an incurable lifelong pain condition, well...that will set you back a ways. But you can live a good and even enjoyable life if you will just do the hard work of managing it. Most people I know who have the disorder don't even try, and I gotta tell you...I don't understand that.\nI guess I don't have enough room to tell you all the things I tried that didn't work...just take my word for it, I've tried everything and nothing else worked for me. I tried all of the approved fibro drugs and they either didn't work at all or had too many side effects. I also tried massage and warm water therapy. They both help during a flare but they have to be repeated so often that it becomes more bother than worth. At least it did for me.\nOh, I almost forgot, get a GeneSight test done so you don't waste 10yrs searching for the right combination of drugs. Your NP can tell you about it, mine did.\nGentle hugs, hope I didn't bore you to death. Once I got going I just didn't seem to be able to quit. lol\n"},{"author":"sickandtiredofbeingsickandtire","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Hi!

That doesn't solve the problem but may explain why its happening. Two suggestions:\n1) Even though you don't eat much, pay attention to the calories you are consuming. Some of the smallest nibbles can pack enough of a calorie bomb to more than make up for a smaller quantity. This is the case with all of my favorite foods.\n2) Keep a food diary, noting the number of calories in everything you eat and drink. Yes, beverages too.

My mornings were the worst. I couldn't get out of bed! I needed(in the warm sheets) to stretch all my muscles (including fingers to toes) before I could stand. It took daily hydration, eating a green antioxidant diet and my meds (muscle relaxant, tramadol and savella as well as B Complex, CoQ10 and magnesium) to get my motor running. To start the day the hot shower would be added in to help the muscles not hurt so much. The water flushing help to remove debris in the muscles and in my feet (It was like walking on glass in the a.m.) So...painful. No one can understand.\nI have always worked and this was an added medicine (distraction) best med I take. But in the early years it was so hard with family not seeing my pain and teenagers that made fun of me....I would cry in hidden places so they didn't see. But I have championed this.\nI still have bad days and I still get my trigger point injections to release the muscles better (I see neurology) but I fight this every day and will not lose one more part of me.\nPacing the days is so important. If I need to do things with the kids I don't do laundry that day or I rest and nap before I head out. But I know the limits and find resting spots or I leave for home. They know I am doing the best I can.\nI suffer at times after a full day with the grandchildren but the love and joy is so good for the spirit and I have to feed that or I will curl up and wither away.\nI will share that this was so bad I was ready to leave this world and then my first grand was born (on my birthday!) Someone at the hospital said.....\"God it trying to tell you something, this doesn't just happen\".....well I cried for a long time privately because I had to stay and I was not in good shape. My husband brought me to a physiatrist who changed my life. I spent alot of money to see him, but I was now fighting to stay. He said ONLY WATER and plenty of it. Meat, chicken and fish, no PROCESSED foods and green veggies only for their antioxidant ability to detox me and help me heal. It changed my life. I was dehydrated and had no idea.....I am so used to all the greens that's all we eat really. Water is my favorite now, where before I NEVER could drink it. I owe him my life. I have 4 grands now, one better than another. I push, rest, plan and regroup. We live by planning our ability. You need to learn you. Get a book and jot down the triggers that get you and increase pain. Jot down what helps you feel better. I found my heating pads, recliner and hands under my hips, showering with hot water.....these all were tools for me. Dishes bothered me so I bought Corelle that are light and I can't break them dropping them. Food shopping and laundry are not done in the same day. Too much.\nI am old now, but I can remember when this all started in a heart beat.\n\nYou can do this!!! You can be a champion.......it takes time and patience. I believe if I can do it, you can.

They wouldn't even put me on medication until I turned 18, then I took Cymbalta for a few years but it made me gain over 30 pounds! I haven't been on prescriptions for almost two years now, and it's hell. I've tried therapy, physical therapy, TENS, orthotics, back braces, chiropractic, heating pads, baths, ice, exercise, special diets, meditation, yoga... everything out there. Talk to your doctor about getting on an antidepressant that is well-known to help with fibromyalgia pain as well. If you start to experience side effects, talk to your doctor about changing meds until you find the right one. I have to say, exercise has helped me the most. I've always continued doing physically laborious jobs and try to exercise at least a few days a week. The more active you are, the less pain you will generally be in and you won't be as stiff. I always take a warm shower when I get up and stretch while in the shower, it helps a lot. Talking to a therapist helps immensely as well, as fibro is believed to be connected to stress and therapy helps with my anxiety, depression, PTSD. I did physical therapy for awhile as well and it helped me get back on my feet after initially being bed-ridden for months. Tell your family that they need to be understanding. It might be hard for them but tell them you need their support right now. You can eventually build a support system of people who are on your team! I've heard chiropractic helps some but I tried it once and it was EXTREMELY painful. So, here is my suggested plan of action for you, as someone who has been there:\nTalk to your doctor about getting on medication. You may need to see a psychiatrist.\nStart seeing a psychologist weekly as well, or a LMHC.\nAsk your doctor for a physical therapy referral or, if possible, aquatic therapy (more helpful for fibro patients!)\nIf necessary, see if you can either 1. see a rheumatologist on a regular basis to help manage your pain or 2. find a pain management clinic in your local area.\nDefinitely get a back brace and orthotics for your shoes, and take Bayer Back and Body when needed.\nMove as much as possible! Try to do yoga, swim, take walks, etc. It will help with stiffness.\nWatch your diet. Keep a food diary and track your moods and pain level. Then you may be able to pinpoint dietary changes which can be made in order to manage your pain. Also, fibro often goes along with IBS so if you start to have those issues you may need to see a gastroenterologist as well.\nYou will figure out what works for you. I've gone through many doctors because I've even had rheumatologists belittle my pain after diagnosis!\nFind the right doctors, the right meds, and the treatment plan that works for you. Good luck!\n4\n"},{"author":"daniellebond4","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"I'm new here and not diagnosed yet but EVERYTHING you all are saying is exactly how I feel, my body was really to tired to think and type to post but I'm making myself I just have something else going on with my thyroid ...4mm nodule on my right and something swelled on the left (waiting for an appointment with endocrinology and rheumatologist) all bloodwork for RA, lupus, basic thyroid came back normal....

As far as your children you must tell them you have limitations on what you can and cannot do compare it to when they are not well and they can't play ect... I do find that streching does relieve some of the pain, also believe it or not walking can bring back some of your energy. Of course a healthy diet is also a must.

It has been many years since my diagnosis. I worked and cared for my children as a single parent for over fifteen years and was diagnosed during that time. My career was very stressful but I continued to work until a few years ago because I had no other option aside from homelessness. It has been stressful but life has settled into a familiar schedule that I can live with. Three times a week I attend a senior warm water aerobics class that is gentle on my joints but keeps my muscles moving and strong. I have a good friend who goes to movies, attends plays and concerts, and has lunch with me on a regular basis. When an outing is scheduled, the days before and after must have periods of extended rest incorporated into the plan. It takes balance, self-knowledge, good friends (most of mine were a gift of the water aerobics class), and a compassionate doctor. I do use spoon theory. I started the day with ten. After a movie, a trip to the store, and preparing dinner, I am left with one spoon.

Newly diagnosed & looking for advice","resp_content":"Good morning Susan,\n\nSharing the alcohol background opened thoughts for me. Most drinkers become Thiamine depleted. Check with the doc if he checked that. Almost all are on Thiamine daily. ETOH takes a toll on you, it would be great if you could find a holistic practitioner to give you a once over. My experience was so worth it. I couldn't follow his holistic pill he wanted for me though. (Sheep's adrenals) like taking prednisone...said I would be on it forever. Oh no...not doing any med forever.\n\nSo in the drinker. B Vitamins get depleted. Easily dehydrated too. I have always been the cheerleader for hydration with WATER...just water. Your body needs no chemicals, flavors, dyes etc. In hydrating, the body can only hold a little extra each day as the kidneys are made to monitor free water ratios, in saying that it take 60-90 days to fully rehydrate. That is exactly the window it took for me to stretch my muscles for the first time. I never realized how dry I had made my body. But water and I are best friends. Hoping you don't smoke? That is another issue, our bodies could only take our bad ways for just so long.\n\nI am 63 and I went from not working and being couch/recliner bound to being so active. I am a nurse and I stole from this body so much to care for others as I worked. I slept little working nights and sometime didn't drink fluids for over 8 hours. I was the charge nurse in a very busy ICU, until my body stopped me in my tracks. I crashed and couldn't work...then worked a little and then a little more and now I am the supervisor of 10 offices. My motor is running again. BUT with wisdom now!\n\nI eat well and eat green (antioxidant veggies) and protein in meat, chicken and fish. I see my neurologist for injections for trigger points (you tube that). Not for the faint of heart, but it is amazing how it gets my body in such a better place.\n\nMy meds are soma (like flexeril but that did nothing to help me) we are all different in what works. I use tramadol for pain (was on motrin only but took so much all the time I had bleeding issues) I take Magnesium, CoQ10 for muscle function and Vi D plus the B Complex.\n\nLook into the book: FM and Chronic Myofascial Pain, a survival manual by Dr Devin Starlanyl. It is my bible. Second edition. It has so much for you there. Also check out Dr Pelligrino's books, he was a champion here at WebMD for us. Amazing help.\n\nI am so glad you are looking to heal yourself. The body is an amazing machine that wants to be healthy and if given the right tools it will repair. If sleep is an issue try the memory foam topper to soften the bed and make the night more restful. I and others sleep in a recliner now, I am almost painfree on arising. In the bed I awake at a 9 out of 10 place (not worth it.)\n\nGood luck, keep posting and let us know how you are doing. This is a tough challenge for all. Getting to know yourself is key. What are your triggers to pain and what are the tools to fix it. You need to make your own toolbox. Heat has always been a friend to us, hoping you have heating pads. Eat right and give up the crap. Do this good living for 2-3 months and you will be amazed at where you are at the end. You won't go back. I paid alot of money for that advice ! lol OH, he also said \"don't get SAD...get MAD! Use the energy that produces. Well I put on the boxing gloves and fought this like a bandit.\n\nThe road was bumpy and full of pain until I got to better, so take it a day at a time and keep coming back to keep us posted. I still have this disease and it is everyday, but I can put it to the back and have a life. YOU can be the champion in this! I can feel it!\n\nPain is awful, it steals from the very center of your spirit so you can't see anything in a day. You will get better. I have seen 9 MDs and tried so many things to be better, we say give it a month if you are starting a med to say yes or no on it. Unless the side effects are too much. Things take time for your body to adjust. Be patient and be kind to yourself.\n\nI wish you well.

No wonder it is angry! As part of my sobriety I got into gardening, a true lifesaver for me. My youngest child is a vegetarian and wanting to live a more organic lifestyle. So we would keep lots of the \"green\" veggies and such in the house. Then with the gardening I had lots of veggies all summer long. Hubby thought we were eating like that due to the garden, but it was for all of our health. We'll just keep that little secret from him, hehe. I was an avid drinker of water during the day which was probably my body's saving grace. After rehab I went to doctor and insisted on full physical and liver check. By some miracle liver tests came back good although I honestly don't know how considering the amount of daily alcohol I drank for years. Tests did show my vitamin d was barely detectable. Sleeping it off all day and never going in the sun will do that to a person! So I spent the summer taking vitamin d and spending lots of time in the sun. It is chartable now but just tiptoed into the bottom of the ok range. With winter coming I have since doubled my daily dose to 5,500 to try to help keep it at a decent range. Taking magnesium too. The rehab immediately put everyone on a multi vit and B1. I have stayed on that and added many more. I was just looking into adding the COQ10. Plus eating healthier (and actually eating period) which is the best way to get the vitamins. The memory foam topper is a great idea, I hadn't even thought of that! We have a hot tub so I use that quite a bit. I'm still learning to pace myself, that seems to be key. I am blessed with a wonderful husband who supported me not only throughout my selfish drinking but also now this! Without him I do not even know what I would do!! And I tell him that daily. I now have gratitude for all things in my life, good or bad, little or big. For so long I took everything for granted. This Fibro isn't going to stop me, I refuse to let it!

I would suggest going to a holistically minded doctor such as an Integrative MD (not many around some areas) or a ND if you are so inclined. You want to be sure to get doses, quality, timing, storage right for supplements, as they too can be expensive and you want them to work optimally for you! These doctors can help you find more natural treatments that might really work well and be easier on your body. Some additional lifestyle changes such as getting processed food out of your diet coupled with reducing pharmaceuticals, might also help lift the brain fog! They can also do much more for hormonal issues - which you might be experiencing - in a safer way that minimizes concern for cancer with traditional hormone replacement.

For me personally, the only thing that works now is caffeine. Unfortunately, I am super sensitive to caffeine and one cup in the morning keeps me up at night. So I have to take a sleeping aid to counteract it. Also, I always have to decide if I really need that cup of real coffee, because I am suppose to avoid caffeine to keep from triggering migraines.\n\nFor someone too tired and in too much pain to move, the last thing you want to hear is that you should exercise - but it really does help. I have been super fortunate to be able to join a medically oriented gym, which is really a step up from physical therapy. The trainers really know their medical complications and this gym caters to many people with physical disorders - but it's not cheap!\n\nIf and when you do exercise, keep in mind how easy it is to overdo it. I suggest doing no more than half of what you think you should or could do (maybe as a guy who thinks he shouldn't complain - even 1/4). Gentle, low weight (really low!), and start slow. Five minutes of walking is better than none!\n\nI whole heartedly recommend trying a very gentle beginners' yoga class. I attended one for people who have Parkinson's disease, and because of me they actually renamed the class to accommodate people with movement disorders including fibro and MS. I have improved enough to graduate to a regular (but gentle) class. Yoga does NOT necessarily require special flexibility - it helps it. Some classes are taught only in chairs. Finding a teacher and class that fits your needs may take some trial and error. Many classes offer a free first class, so you can shop around. Be sure to discuss your fibro with the instructor.\n\nAlso, I suggest finding help in coping mentally. Learning that pain and suffering are not synonymous is a key concept. You can have pain, yet not always suffer horribly from it. I don't want to minimize the challenges we all face, yet it was important for my coping toolbox to accept the pain as a message from my body rather than as an evil foe.\n\nSorry I was so long winded. I'm stuck inside during a blizzard and just had real coffee, so I'm a chatter-box!\n1\n"},{"author":"pelto","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Some excellent info there, and I appreciate your sharing it.

I have been reading and studying,listening and testing up on FM,MS,Lupis, even persuaded them to let me try to have Hypothyroidism and every other acronym for the last 10 years! 10 years ago,thats when this ALL finally \"exploded\" for lack of a better word! I have been reading ALOT of peoples entries here in this chat group and yours just felt all to familiar.

Kind of sounds like I could take two years off the top then Then we could just be forty again! Well anyway, that's my attempt at cyber-humor! I have been a patient of a great Neurologist for about 10 years now. 10 LONG CRAZY UP AND DOWN, mostly DOWN, years. The only think that's been on the upside the past 2 years is my WEIGHT!! It was however, my exploring EVERY OTHER MEDICAL SPECIALIST and getting EVERY OTHER specialty TEST/exam done on every ongoing symptom, side effect,concern,PAIN, and just plain ingnorance(unknoledgeable) questio that just NEEDED AN ANSWER!! What the HELL is wrong with me!? That's how I ended up with Fibromyalgia. I guess my Nerologist just Dosent diagnosis that!?!?!? Don't get me wrong,I love my Nerologist he's the ONLY Dr. That even cares and wants to try to help me at least for 10 minutes out of my life once a month!!\nI really want to keep this positive and helpful to you so I won't complain anymore. I also have been on Cymbalta for years and attempted to come off and couldn't even function from the PAIN. I ALSO STAYED ON! It is one of the only three drugs the FDA has OK'd for FM! I have tried the other two with terrible side effects so it's Cymbalta for me!\nONE reason I see a Nerologist is for Migrains! Yes Headaces! I assumed it was part of the FM package!

My doctor just kind of blew this off telling me I was probably just depressed or menopausal, but I wasn't depressed, what was depressing was all the other symptoms. About a month ago I think I had my 1st real \"FLARE UP\" had never heard of that but researched a lot and when I saw that I have to saw it was a relief to know that I wasn't alone! I went back to my GP - explained all of this once again... and this time he finally diagnosed me with Fibro. I am on day 8 of taking the prescribed Lyrica. In the first 5 days of starting Lyrica I have to tell you - I was in complete shock at how GOOD I felt! I was in tears just at the thought that I felt like MYSELF again.

I believe I have had symptoms for 20 years. I got to be in so much pain after the last 10 or so. I was diagnosed quickly by a very good and intuitive doctor. I was given Vicodin in addition to meds I was already on. Right now I'm on flexeril, Prozac, Clonazapin and other unrelated medications. I was sent to a Rheumatologist he also diagnosed fibromyalgia. I was give up to 4 Vicodin a day. I moved twice since diagnosis and 4 additional doctors agreed.\n\nI am now experiencing the worse flare I could imagine. I the mean time I have had injections in my lower back and shoulder. And they do work temporarily just like they do in any person with any ailment. So do not believe anyone who says otherwise. I had them but have not really needed them until now. I had injections in to my spinal cord guided by ultrasound I think.\n\nI am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I was the first woman funeral director in my county to become licensed. I had to do everything the men did and I knew I would have to prove myself. And I did lifted, embalmed, made removals etc. I was on call all the time. We used pagers then. I have been licensed 25 years. I am 55 years old. I know I may have damaged my back because of my job , but I have pain everywhere.\n\nI went to mortuary science as though it was a calling. Not just a job. I did everything and more because I loved it. Truly loved every part of it. In my state you must mold a Bachelors Degree in order to be licensed. You must take a national testing exam and 2 other state exam and do a one year apprenticeship before getta license. I weighed about 100 lbs at the time but I did everything the guys did. It was funny to me that people would ask if I liked being a mortician. Who would go through all that and not love it?\n\nI worked a long time with fibro until I just couldn't do it anymore. Even learning the new computer systems confused me. I was the one in the funeral home to go to out of state training for computer training and train the funeral directors at our funeral home and others. Now. I can do none of it. Can't stay on feet too long. Hands hurt and cramp. I drop things. I am clumsy. Extra sensitive to cold so taking out a winter funeral was actually painful. I could not do all the things I used to... And in funeral service if you can not do everything you don't keep your job if you can only accomplish 1 or 2 tasks. Well 2 years ago I quit working. Not by choice... The pain was getting so bad. Even with injections and all they can not nor will they give you injections all over you body. My hands, feet, back, hips,neck hurt everyday in some way. Do not even ask about sexual problems but my husband is not one that deserves this missing part of our lives. Some days worse than others just like you describe in your posts. But I will not give up.\n\nI can not work and they do not think I need disability. So the profession I so loved is gone to me.\n\nDo not let any doctors, nurses, rheumatologist or neurologist tell it doesn't get worse. My symptoms were progressing while I was still working. And I do believe they may get worse or out or control after a tragedy.\n\nMy oldest son was suffering from a disease that required a kidney transplant. At first he was not diagnosed and he was seeing a doctor who gave him OxyContin for years. After a couple suicide attempts I took him to the clinic. Needless to say the doctor fled the country and my son was hopelessly addicted to opiates.\n\nWe tried to tell everyone before surgery and after that he was narcotic intolerant. After surgery he was in so much pain I had to cry, Yell and to them over and over. Drew's surgery was a partial success but he still had a lot of pain and because I could not be sure the pain was real and and he was in detox several times I did not take him back to Cleveland Clinic. I am guilty of that. Meanwhile Drew fathered a beautiful little girl. They never married but she became a huge part of his life and ours.\n\nDrew was a father to this beautiful girl. Unfortunately she lost her daddy to suicide when she was five.\n\nI know all about grief. The normal and not normal and I thought I was doing ok. It took a time to even be ok I cry for him every night.\n\nI now know that my symptoms of fibromyalgia were getting worse after his death. A bit at a time and just 2 years after his death am in more pain than ever. Am I having a flare or will I be like this the rest of my life?\n\nI can not work, I can't do housework, I can't do much of anything. I still do housework and indoor and outdoor gardening. Well I can't do it really without severe pain. But I will not have everything taken from me\n\nWill I have to live my life like this. When I'll be able to do anything??\n\nThat is what concerns me most. I have a wonderful husband...but who would want to retire in 10 years to this? I have another son. He was born 16 months from Drew and is coping as well as he can. He was doing drugs and is in recovery. But went through so much to get him where he is no.\n\nI want to be with with Drew and my mom and my sisters who are with him now... But I can not and will not. I have to many people to take care of. My dad lives with us. It's been 2 years he's been here and he has severe back pain and is being treated by the clinic. I take him where he needs to go as well. My mom died one year ago September. So of course I grieve her as well. She was my go to. Because those of us who have lost children have no names to describe us.\n\nI was doing a funeral with a clergy member wo had lost one of his twin sons in a house fire. We were discussing that there is no name because it would be a very ugly name. Then he said to me \" yo know what we are ? We are screwed.\n\nWith each new trial with my loved ones will I continue to get worse? Or more cramps and more pain and fatigue and scrambled egg brain going to get worse ? Or is this just a flare up ? My symptoms have got nothing but worse. I can't even blow dry my hair it hurts so much.\n\nSo until I talk to a doctor who has fibromyalgia all I know is it gets worse.","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Addie","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: I feel as though I've lost everything","resp_content":"Thank you so very much for sharing your story.

The rheumatologist spent less than ten minutes with me and never asked about pain. He pinched my joints and said I had it and gave me a pamphlet which explained pain as the main symptom, just as everything I've read before and since says. I never followed through on it because my primary complaint is chronic intermittent fatigue... meaning I go through l long periods where I am always overtired, tired to the bone, is my usual description. And there were other reasons I didn't feel the doctor was a good match for me.\n\nThere are also times when I wake up not tired. Those times used to last longer than they do now.\nI'm not without pain, but 99% of the time it is logical. With the fatigue it seems that the closest I usually have of pain is a tired achyness like you might get doing some heavy labor, except I often wake up feeling it. Other times it unexpectedly wallops me. Other times I am just extremely fatigued with no pain or ache.\n\nMore recently I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I'm very good about keeping my mask on all night and at first it seemed to help, but the fatigue didn't go away, just the tiredness -- ie. I'm not always sleepy, but just worn out tired for no reason\n\nSo what I'm asking is does this actually seem like fibromyagia or it it \"just\" some form of cfs that my doctors can't or won't label as such. I don't care about labels, but maybe if this seems more like fm than cfs or \"unknown\", there may be different things to do to cope with it. Right now the only thing that helps is exercise (walking), but it doesn't always help. Sometimes it just wears me out more, even though I love walking.

I'm interested in knowing what meds are you taking.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"booch007","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Responding to Nancy B.","resp_content":"Oh if this was an easy answer. The reason the docs cringe with having us as patients is \"we are all different\" Our body chemistry has changed and it has changed in different ways. I will tell you my mix and I should tell you my other tries but it would be lengthy...\n\nIt can be all about that you stopped therapy in to short a time. When you take meds you need to give it 60 days , unless there is a real side effect like I had with Cymbalta. That med and I are not friends and I knew I didn't need it. It is a seratonin elevator my seratonin is fine.\n\nMy doc retired and the new doc, put me on Savella after fighting with me. Savella is a classed the same as cymbalta but it raises norepinephrine 3 times that of seratonin. NOW THAT HELPED.\nNorepinephrine is you fight and flight chemical and I was almost painfree with it. I suggest that you do not use the start pac. I was not sleeping and chewing the inside of my mouth and grinding my teeth...\n\nIt was too much to take 50mg twice a day. I only needed 12.5mg a day.\nSo start with 12.5mg and slowly go to twice a day then 25mg and then twice a day and follow yourself. Stop when you feel edgy. (if you go this way)\n\nWe have learned here among ourselves that we are sensitive people.\nI am not on savella anymore as it was expensive and my good deeds in other ways and a change in job position helped me to cut back.\n\nI have always been on SOMA: a muscle relaxant that gives you a 1-2 punch. It starts as a sedative so it helped me sleep and then chemically helps the muscles (flexeril didn't help at all).\n\nI use still to this day I use Advil 600mg to cover the pain. ( Now for breakthrough above the tramadol) I took so much though that I had bleeding issues. They made me cross to tramadol. First Ultracet at 37.5mg and now due to insurance and preferred $$ 50mg Tramadol.\n\nThat is all I take in Rx world. Now:\n\nI take CoQ10 200mg (I buy when it is 1/ 1free) and Vitamin D 2000u after 50,000u Rx as my levels in lab were 12 (so low). Magnesium 200mg at night (muscle health) and B Complex (nerve health).\n\nNow what else do I take? Distraction, ALOT OF IT....STRONGEST PILL IN MY BOX! . I get out and get up. If you distract the brain it doesn't hold on to the quality or quantity of the pain once medicated. Be positive, be aggressive to be better. I use to say \"I was dragging this dragon\" of ours and then \"boxing gloves fighting this dragon\"...now I am \"dancing with this dragon\". Wondered to if you really get used to him being there with you always?\n\nI feel I am the strongest person I know and the gang that was here are also champions in this mess. You can get there. Hydrate and flush your body. Stop the chemicals that we have no idea what they may become once all together in your body. I had to stop diet anything to get those chemicals out of me. It worked to eat plenty of green veggies to antioxidant myself. I feel blessed that the right doc was in front of me finally (9) docs I saw and no one knew what was wrong. He cleaned* me up and got me moving in a positive direction.\n\nHe said \"Nancy...don't get sad...get MAD\" it is a useful position to be in, hence the boxing gloves.\n\nNow if you have read the other posts of mine I am high functioning but I pace things to. A journal to find my triggers and fixes helped make my toolbox. I am a person (A) that wants to say \"look what I did!\" not \"I can't do that\" is that a good thing? maybe not at times.\n\nOK, I hope I helped. I am here on Sundays to check in. This a.m. alot of trouble because I crossed the line yesterday and I think it was at Urgent care with my sister in law (SIL). The staff didn't help with the wheelchair and the foot pads up and down (trigger at that angle) but I had to do it........poop. I will shower this out and massage my muscles and will win....

I am overweight and if you grab my arms to lock them with yours. O U C H is for sure.

Exercise has always been a no no for me, but stretching and moving is a benefit. I am moving until 3 pm....then I turn into a pumpkin again. :).\nPacing is the best advice to an FMer.

I went many places, took surveys and moved around for 30 minutes!.

This site is what is the most important to the package of anything they read. To hear how to apply all that info.\n\nIt is trial and error. It is taking it slow and re-evaluating in 30-60 days to see did it make a difference. It is life changing, the person you were before is gone and the new one is emerging.

Yes I tried the holistic treatment. I was so ill in 2006 I left TN to go to the Fibromyalgia & Fatigue center in Bellvue , WA. I took herbal IV treatments for 10 months which I could tell some difference regarding fatigue; but, then was told by my husband at the time that my son was in a coma state at a Knoxville hospital. I stopped treatments. They were exceptional when it came to tests as I believe they took over 60 tests. I was told if I had not left TN I would have lived maybe a year. My adrenal gland was shutting down. I wish at times I would never have left TN so I would not have had to watch my son die. My ptsd is due to the day he died which I recently found out my husband..Jeffs stepfather told the hospital he was Jeffs dad and gave permission to turn off life support. I was the only one that could make that decision and I knew my son was going to wake up and be ok. He wasn't brain dead. I have nightmares of him screaming inside for me to help him but no one could hear him. So much makes sense now why the dr wouldn't answer me..no one in the room would tell me what was going on; the death certificate was already in the room. Sorry for getting off subject. Do you have fibro or any of the symptoms related to ME/CFS? I couldn't believe all these years so many of the symptoms I thought was due to the fibro or the ptsd is ME/CFS. The new antidepressant they put me on I feel is helping a lot when it comes to concentration and focus. No side affects which is great. Its Trintellix 10mg once a day. You should have your adrenal checked also. Do you know if there is any test such as mri of the brain that shows anything that would diagnose ME/CFS opposed to CFS? Thank you again.

I use motrin above my meds for help but I take Soma, Tramadol, Vit D, CoQ10, Magnesium for my issues and then meds for b/p. I bought corelle dishes as I drop things from nerve involvement in the hands they are light and don't break*.. It is a balance of good days and bad.

What I find is that all the little things added together lead to \"better\". Unless you are in a flare...then a shut down and rest for a couple of days has to be done.

Hydrate: don't forget your body is trying to function and needs fluid to do that. Move: I think you have that down. But move within your lines. Know your limits. Pacing oneself is a big one.\n\nWhen I was with patients I was very aware of the muscle groups I was using, always looking to change it up and then rest the others. I changed my shoes to a different pair each day to use different leg muscles as they all pitch me different. Take your meds, don't wait for pain to be at a 10. I knew I was starting to fail and would get my meds on board and keep the pain to a minimum.\n\nWorking to me is a distraction, the strongest pill I swallow. Being in public, in the diversity of life keeps my mind busy from having the pain be the first thing I know is there. I also have music on all the time...gets me humming or singing if I am home. It's all good.\n\nThere is no magic pill, no one thing that is a fix for us. It is multi-disciplinary and trial and error is how we came to figure some of it out for ourselves. I think if I had one thing I would say: Stay warm....\nis the greatest advice. Being cold spasms my muscles and tightens them making this worse.\n\nI wish you better days and continued function at your level. You are doing a lot right. You'll figure this out for you. I add now that a flare can bite you at anytime, sometimes there is no figuring them out. I only let mine take 2 days of rest and then I get back in life and work.\n\nHugs from me,\nNancy B\n"},{"author":"llk717","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you.

In my path I had issue and took my meds way before I arrived to patients. I in no way have a buzz from my meds, they keep me moving and on point. We do not drug test but I would be positive from my Soma (muscle relaxant) I have a long medical file to show cause.\n\nYou know you. Take a break at the 40 minutes after meds until you are back on point. So prior to lunch take meds and then break and rest. Lol, do NPs in Psych get a break?? I know in Cardiology it is hit or miss....lol\n\nI had an NP who had bilateral mastectomies and she needed a \"heated vest\" to help with the implants, due to being so cold as foreign fluid on the chest wall (who knew?) But that can add warmth to our day.\n\nI am getting close to looking into them. Stay warm, keep a water bottle near at all times. Change those shoes..it is amazing how it helped me. Think about your posture and straighten up alot. Take a moment an breathe right, get good O2 in, amazing how we don't really breathe fully despite the sighs our system has programmed in it. Even in that med break, take the time to think about breathing, the mantra of it can make a difference.\nGood luck in your journey to better.

I stopped eating them and have been pain free for about 20 years now.\nThrough personal Research I discovered the poison in the Night Shade plants attacks the long central nerves in the body. This causes inflammation of the nerves which in turn causes horrible pain.\nBefore I knew this I made potato soup and ate it Friday night, and three times on Sat.. Sunday morning my legs were in so much pain that my brain refused to allow them to move. I dragged myself down to the spa tub and there regained movement after an hour of swirling hot water.\nPotato gives me horrible pain in my legs.\nI have scars on my arm when my skin came in contact with tomato juice resulting in serious blisters.

I shuffled when I walked and had to pull myself up one stair at a time when going up steps.\nI was going to a physical therapist who found that my elongated nerves were twisted like a rubber band.

My guests enjoy this substitution also. A favorite for breakfast is raw fried red sweet potatoes and onions salted to taste.\nI use horseradish, mustard, white and black pepper to add \"hot\" to recipes.

You do use a lot of med for balance in your day. Hoping you can pull off some of it. The thing that changed my muscles and pain was to get rehydrated. I was put on a 'green is mean' diet. All green vegetables and meat, chicken and fish. Only water and plenty of it no soda or junk....It was hard..real hard. I remember calling the physiatrist and saying \"I have nothing to live for..there is nothing sweet in my day!\" He said he would get me better. He said to do this for 90 days. If I broke the detox I would have to start as day one again. (So I behaved as I was desperate)\n\nI was at the point of suicide and leaving. I couldn't walk or do anything. My feet felt like glass when I walked on them, hands burned and numb, headaches and painful flu like muscles. I did what he said.\n\nMy habit was, while in bed I would stretch my muscle before leaving the warm sheets. Fingers to toes. Stretched out and then pulled in. They never listened...but I would try. THEN one day they released and there was no rebound pain. I was still not right but dang it I could open the muscles and get them to listen.\n\nThis disease is the biggest challenge I have ever had to handle. I too am in healthcare, I am a nurse, an ICU nurse who worked crazy hours, days and put myself to the last of the line wit raising my family. I broke. Lifting in the ICU is at chest level so the neck gets in trouble. Floor nurses usually there backs as the beds are down.\n\nSo, that is some of my story and path. I joined here a long time ago and they taught me of the memory foam topper, it aided in better sleep and that also aids in relief and healing. I journaled a list of triggers to pain and relief items to begin a toolbox for myself.\n\nIn my box of meds were Vit B complex for nerve assist and CoQ10 200mg for muscle cell function, magnesium 200mg at night for spasm and issue. I use only Soma for spasm and Tramadol for pain, but I had been on savella instead of Cymbalta and found it great for pain relief. It increases norepinephrine more than seratonin (that is the flight or fight chemical) Cymbalta and I didn't get along.\n\nFor you I hope the best. A good team around you is priceless. Family support and if you don't have that you have here....put it all here. It helps. I had issues for a long time at home, until I started Trigger Point injections and my husband followed me....B I G for him to see a doctor injecting so many spots. He believed in my invisible disease then and became the champion I needed.\n\nA lot here say PT is no good for us, I too found that. Walking and stretching, the best heating pad you can find (I now have a heated car seat too!) it all helps. I add distraction and get out in the world to help me turn down the pain I feel. Always in pain but at a lower level to live with. I hope you and your team can get down off some of those meds and you develop a toolbox to use for bad days.\n\nWe are the strongest people I know.

I find that so amazing and challenging.\n\nIt is surprising to hear this is totally a new issue after so many years. So I will ask you....are you blaming FM for something that is age related and not a flare at all? I have had that happen. I have sat back and said it is FM and then find out I was sick with something. (lymes is one)\n\nHaving this mess is so difficult for most including our docs as it is always a 'watch and observe to figure it out issue'. Be sure though that it is not something important. You can developed an inflammatory disease, you can have an immune disorder. Get them checked out. Maybe run all this to the doc and review labs again.\n\nI have always feared having a heart attack and blaming my CP on FM! That I will miss the signs that are different, if they will be different.\n\nSo my thoughts for you are that you feel better soon because flares are no fun, they pull you down.

Fall is coming soon and this is my favorite season. Spring is OK as we are so ready after a long winter but this is the time of year I feel better*. My stiffness is better, I sleep better and I have more energy in the cool air than I do during summer. Maybe it's from resting during the hot days or all the pool work that is able to get done to move my limbs and muscles. Maybe it's a higher or highest Vit D level as I take my vitamin and sit in the sun. All I know is I am better in Fall.\n\nI love the leaves changing and seeing the true color of that leaf before it falls off. Understanding this is the season of their lives. All things have a time to be born, time to live and a time to die. We have to stay in our living phase....moving and joining in to things happening around us. I know it is hard, but caring for yourself is imperative. Be a champion, be amazing....no one is going to care for you like you can. Don't put crap in your mouth, eat well. No soda, your body asks for water. H2O a simple chemical to help it clear its wastes.\n\nI so believe we are what we eat. I got here to the board because I asked so much of my body and gave it little. Well it stopped me in my tracks and I could hardly walk. The pain was a 12+ and movement so challenged. The board here 13 years ago saved my life. It is so valuable a home to come back to because of that. I am hoping the fmily will follow and return.\n\nSleep was a big thing that this condition took from me. What helped? A memory foam topper, the thickest I could afford, I started with 3\" and now have 6\" from Overstock.com. It helped the trigger point knots from hurting and making me toss and turn all night.\n\nThe warm shower before bed and when I awoke to stretch and move a bit. I learned to change to a new shoe, using different leg muscles as I walked and it changes the whole body frame. Wear good shoes that support you. Paying attention to posture helped my muscles perform and know what was what.\nIt took years of day by day and two steps forward and one step back....to get where I am today.\n\nWe are the strongest people I know. The trials this gave me were momentous and no one would understand, only the fmily here who was walking close to the path I had. Please stay and post your issues and needs. I am only here on the weekends now as I am back to work and am full time 5 (ugh) days a week. I do live to work as it takes all I have to do that. But that is OK, I am productive and I make a difference in the world.\n\nI hope one change at a time and a bucket of patience for you will make a difference for you too. The strongest med I take is distraction. Laughter and humor is second before the meds I swallow from the MD. After meds I get out and in distraction and the pain and dysfunction lightens up and is put to the back of my head so I can have a day.... my day. Memories made and then kept. We become the sum of our memories.\n\nOK, good luck to those who find this site. There are a few that are here.

I have found for me that when I have something done or put under a stressor, I can expect a problem with my body.\n\nI have always given it 2 days to rest and return to better, using heat, fluids, meds and rest. I use the couch or recliner and will drop back from my activities for 2 days and then \"get out and up\"... I go somewhere special to bring up my own serotonin. Like going to the craft store and looking at colors, colors change your brain chemistry. Or the dollar store, Christmas tree shop...all gets my head better. We are starting our leaf changes here in NY and it always gives me a boost.\n\nTry not to be down while your body is talking. This is a wax and wane disease where we are always dealing with pain but the volume of it is turned up at times and down at others. Our brains have more control of us then we realize.\n\nWhen I worked in Hospice I remember being taught that few will die at Christmas. It was true...too much love in the air, so much joy around their beds. The holidays were usually quiet. You have a spirit in you and it can help in your control.\n\nI had that expensive MD tell me \"Don't get sad.....get mad\" It is a productive emotion. That is why I get up and out in 2 days.

It was when I couldn't work that I decided it was time for some serious treatment for my depression. So, I found a residential treatment program, supposedly best in the world for trauma, and signed up. I've never been in any kind of residential treatment, so it was kind of traumatic having all my control over my life taken away, having my bags searched, and having to submit to a strip search (down to my undies).\nBut then they took away my Tramadol and Provigil! I wouldn't be able to work without the Provigil - it keeps me from falling asleep at my desk, in meetings, etc.\nI ended up leaving after 10 days rather than the minimum 28 days and now I seem to be in a relatively mild flare. Lots more pain than usual but not unbearable pain.\nAlso, I had what I found out is called a Thunder Clap headache. That's when you suddenly get a crippling pain in your head for up to a minute followed by a bad headache lasting from an hour to several days. I Googled it and it said it could be life threatening and get the the emergency room immediately. So, I did and a CAT scan of my brain showed no damage. So that's great.\nBut I am curious what people think about having my fibro meds (Tramadol and Provigil) taken away and being offered only Ibuprofen and Tylenol in place of my regular meds.\nI try to avoid Ibuprofen because it can cause bleeding in your stomach, I have taken a lot of it over the years and even before I ever started taking Ibuprofen, for the past 40 years I have had stomach issues - it feels like my stomach is on fire if I don't take Prilosec every day. And I never felt like Tylenol did anything for my pain.\nThey said once I get the depression under control, I'll have more energy and less pain and won't need my fibro meds.\nSo, do you think the Thunderclap headache was a result?

We've had some questions come up on how to best use these new boards. Thought I'd take some time to try and answer some of them in a new post. If you have more questions or suggestions on how we can improve your experience, please add on to this post. We welcome any and all of your feedback and suggestions!\n\n1. What are tags and how do I use them?\n\nTags are located in the drop-down menu \"All Topics\" at the top of your board's main page. Selecting a tag from the drop-down will sort your message board so that you only see posts where other members have selected to use that tag when posting. Adding these tags to your posts is encouraged so that others can easily find them, but it is not required. If you have suggestions for other tags you would like to see, please send them our way.\n\n2. How do I get back to the main Fibro community?\n\nThe \"breadcrumb\" links that you see at the top of the page can help you navigate from the main board page into a post and back again. You will see Message Boards > Health Conditions > Fibromyalgia > Name of the post you are in.\n\nClicking on message boards will bring you to the list of all message boards that we have.\n\nHealth Conditions will bring you to all health condition message boards (we also have Living Healthy and Pregnancy & Family boards).\n\nAnd clicking Fibromyalgia will bring you to the main Fibro board. As has been mentioned in a previous post here, if you have selected a tag from the drop-down and then view a post, hitting Fibromyalgia to go back will erase the tag that you have selected. If this happen re-selecting the tag will bring you back to the view you were on. An easier solution that was suggested is that when you are in a post, hit the back button on your browser to return to the exact page you are on (we are working on making this more simple).\n\n3. How can I get in touch with another member?\n\nYou can now @ reply another member when writing a post, which will alert them that someone is trying to get in touch with them. Simply type an @ symbol before typing another member's name. A list of names will drop down. Select the username you are looking for -- make sure that you leave the string of numbers and letters within the ( ) there and continue your message after that.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to alert me type @WebMDAddie and the computer will give you the option to select my username.\n\n4. How do I know if someone responded to a post I created or participated in?\n\nMake sure that you keep an eye on the little bell symbol at the top of the page. That will let you know if someone has @ replied you in a message or if there has been any activity on a post that you have created or participated in (there will be a little number up there).\n\nClick on the alert and it will provide a list of the posts. The ones in blue are the ones that you have not yet seen. Click on the posts to view the message. After you have clicked on all alert posts, the number alert will disappear.\n\n5. How to I see older posts on this board?\n\nTo see older posts, or to just page through all posts on the board, use the little blue arrows on the bottom of the page.\n\nHere's a link of answers to some Frequently Asked Questions that we put together and that you may find helpful: https://messageboards.webmd.com/w/faqs\n\n(it is also located under the Helpful Links heading on the bottom right of every page).\n\nI hope that this helps, and please continue to ask more questions (or for more explanation if needed).

It is just a new site with nothing there. If the Fmily wants back, they need to post their stories and make a new toolbox to save on the posting over and over the tools we use for better. I miss being here but I am doing Ok. Busy with the supervisor position and those shoes are fitting better. I step over the line as always and then recoup. I wish all well here and hoping that there is good guidance that flows.

The following post is something that FMily member MeMe put together awhile back, and that I think has really helped a lot of members of this community. We wanted to make sure that this post made its way to our new home here. So, without further ado, here is her original post:\n\n“My name is MeMe, I'm an FM suffer of 19 years, along with autoimmune diseases & other conditions. We are delighted to have you join us!\n\nYou have certainly come to the right place for support & understanding! You'll meet many warm & friendly people here who are willing to share great tips & whom are here to listen & to support you on your new journey living w/ FM. We all have so much in common & you'll fit right in, my friend! You join in and share at any time you like.\n\n*The most important & most difficult is ACCEPTANCE! Then learning to live within your new found limitations. Setting realistic goals & making changes. Learning to say NO.\n\n*Acceptance of the \"New You\" is so important in keeping your self confidence, security, & inner strength! You are still YOU, just differently abled. I firmly believe in remembering/accepting all that you DO have to offer, dispite your current limitations!\n\n*Pacing yoursef is a MUST, even on good days. LISTEN to your body! Getting restorative/restful nights sleep is important. Rest & take breaks when your tired.\n\n*Recommend U trying STOPAIN in spray form, it's very cooling/tingliny, it helps to relieve pain. Found @ WalMart, in the pharmacy section, under $8.00\n\n*Taking hot baths & soaking in epsom salt helps to alleviate the pain & stiffness! Heating pads, electric blankets, DeepHeating WellPatch are also helpful.\n\n*Village Naturals Therapy Mineral Bath Soak for Aches & Pains w/ Eucalytus, Rosehips & Chamomile (contains epsom & sea salts) - great for soaking. It's very cooling & relaxing. Found at WalMart.\n\n*Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint Pure Castile Soap made w/ Organic Oils, is extremely wonderful for bathing & soaking! It's intensely cooling & tingly, helping to relieve pain temporarily. -A personal favorite of mine- Using a loofah and body brush is great for appliying, to open up pores for optimal results. Found at Vitamin World in a 32 oz. bottle or at drbronner.com\n\n*Doing gentle stretches before & after getting out of bed & after a hot bath helps to loosen tight muscles, taking deep breaths as you do them.\n\n*Massage & hot stone therapy is a great alternative for temp. pain relief.\n\n*Walking & warm water therapy is a gentle way of getting in excercise into your weekly routine. This helps to keep you mobile. You cannot feel your weight in pounds in the water, as you don't feel your pain. Dr's highly recommend this form of exercise!\n\n*Doing gentle exercises & stretches are great for maintaing/gaining muscle strength & increases mobility & flexibility, easing muscle & joint pain & stiffness. Pilates workouts, exercise balls & resistance bands are great tools for stretching!\n\n*Treatment alternatives: accupuncture, biofeed back, psychotherapy/counseling, PT, aqua therapy, & massage.\n\n*Simplify your life. Avoiding/preventing as much stress in all areas of your life as much as possible is key, as this fuels added pain.\n\n*Following the recommendations of your dr & taking prescriptions as prescribed, responsibly.\n\n*Educate yourself & family, keeping up with new research. Print out info for friends/family.\n\n*Learning to ask for help can be very beneficial, as this will relieve you of some tasks others can do.\n\n*Have a good support system. Staying connected with other people to avoid isolation & depression is theraputic.\n\n*Excercise your brain daily to help keep your mental faculties stronger & to help brain fog by doing cross words games. Challenge your mind doing mental exercises to keep your mind sharp.\no *Know that FM is not life threatening! Accept your symptoms wax & wane, but flares are transient & ultimately improve.\n\n*Accept that life is different for you & know that U can still find joy in your life & you are valuable!\n\nAgain, its so nice to meet you, my friend. You've found such a wonderful group! I hope to get to know you better. So sorry your suffering with FM just like all of us. But we are always here to pick each other up! You'll get much encouragement from many. Hope you stay with us! Keep well.\n\nWelcome to Our FMily & Warm Hugs to You,\n~*MeMe*~”","like_count":"2","tags":["Medications","Living With","Symptoms","Daily Check-In","Home Remedies","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/119/living-with-fibromyalgia-toolbox"}]
