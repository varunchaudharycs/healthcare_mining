It was the 1950’s at the time when she was alive and unfortunately, she was not part of the upper class which did not work in her favor when it came to health care services. At the time, due to the lack of regulations in health care Henrietta’s cells were captured (for a better lack of a word) without her consent by a John Hopkins doctor who used them as a guinea pig to find cures and disburse to several other doctors. That is the image Rebecca Skloot painted for readers like myself when describing Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) medical life history.\nJohn Hopkins Medicine, however, describes Henrietta Lacks cells being removed by the “renowned gynecologist” (The Legacy of Henrietta Lacks, 2020) as the best thing that could have ever happened. They state her cells were removed after passing during a biopsy and were cells like hers were “never seen before”, in essence how they thrived after she passed (The Legacy of Henrietta Lacks, 2020).\nSkloot portrayed Henrietta’s family in the most tasteful way an author could. She was unbiased and allowed them to speak for themselves. “Deborah and Zakariyya stared at the screen like they'd gone into a trance, mouths open, cheeks sagging. It was the closest they'd come to seeing their mother alive since they were babies” (Skloot, 2010). In this section of the book, Skloot allows the reader to imagine HeLa’s daughters by describing every reaction and possibly thought.\nYes, in a sense I do agree with Lenguaer’s quote on emphasing the importance of knowing who Henrietta was. She was not just her cells, she was a person with a family, heart and rights. As Mary Kubicek stated in the book, \"I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we'd been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman\" (Skloot, 2010).\nLearning about Henrietta’s Lacks story has increased my awareness of patient rights as a patient and as a professional in the health care industry. It has made me grateful for all those who fought for consent forms, HIPPA and many other regulations with patients in mind. In addition medical providers can continue to strive to prevent unethical practices by peer reviews and reinforce consequences to those who do malpractice.\n \nReferences\nSkloot, R. (2010).

Some people know those are the initials of a person, but they don't know who that person is. That's important history.\" (Skloot, 2010, Pg. 266) What is Hela? Where did it come from? Why is it so important? These are all questions I asked myself when reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This story changed the way I view cells, science, medical practices, research, race, and American history. I believe the book provided a lot of information in reference to the foundation of several science breakthroughs and the way cancer is treated today. This book moved me to want to know more about Henrietta’s diagnosis, and why her cells made an imprint on medical history.\nHenrietta Lacks made the biggest medical contribution, after her cancer biopsy became the first immortal cell line. “Hela” cells are the standard in labs around the world, its amazing to think a poor, African American women, with a middle school education revolutionized modern medicine. Although Henrietta’s cells made scientific breakthroughs throughout the world, I still believe the Lacks families story is a tale of exploitation. Cells were collected and tested without the patient’s consent. Not only were medical advances made through this contribution, a lot of money was made as well, and nothing was passed on to the Lacks family. After reading the book by Skloot, I began to question the obscure world of medical research. What happens to biospecimens that have been discarded? When we undergo surgery, what happens to what’s left over? Are the biopsies and blood test we get being discarded or are they being kept for further research? I feel consent is needed for the study of biospecimen research no matter what the circumstances are.\nProblematic Elements\nWhat happened to the Lacks Family reflects injustice. This situation took place in the 1950’s, consider the racism in health care during this time. I also felt the pain her family had to endure after her passing and not being able to have access to proper health care for themselves. I would be outraged to know that I have made such an imprint in medical research, but my family has little to no access to health care. The narrative Skloot paints in my opinion as the reader helped me to understand the importance of consent. I know some would argue, why does it matter what happens to left over biospecimens if it becomes waste? Or why interfere with research that could bring value, quality of life and survival to human beings? Requiring consent, may not be a big deal to some, but it is. Under no circumstance should a patient be left in the dark when it comes to their biospecimens and the importance of them. I feel the book could have covered more on education and what the medical laws were in the 1950’s and what practices the health care industry uses today. Instead of focusing on compensation and the family’s personal lives. In all honesty, when writing the book Skloot had the platform to address a lot of issues and educate so many people on the facts and that didn’t happen. Although we got a good idea of what happened to Henrietta and her family a lot of important details were not mentioned.\nChristoph Langauer\nIn the beginning of the article I started with a quote from Christoph Langauer, “Whenever we read books about science, it's always HeLa this and HeLa that. Some people know those are the initials of a person, but they don't know who that person is. That's important history.” I believe this quote is important because the compassion this man displayed in the book is how all health care professionals and patient relationships should be. He took the time to research the Lacks family and meet with them to explain their mother’s contribution to science. He humanized Henrietta, she was a wife and mother and sister before she gave the world her famous cell line “HeLa”. Henrietta was forgotten as a person; she became something voiceless with no soul just research. But when he met with the family, he was able to show her children she was very much alive.\nEthical Leadership\nAlthough we have safeguards to prevent an ethical breach from happening today, the Lacks family wasn’t so lucky. According to Mahon (2017), “Henrietta’s story raises questions about ethics, race, and genetics. The book encourages the reader to think about the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over who owns and controls genetic material.” (Mahon, 2017, para. 3) Through this story, I was able to understand what an ethical leader is and what I should make sure I am doing as a leader. An ethical leader encourages people to learn and understand science, and what damage unethical choices can cause. As an ethical leader it’s your job to educate your patients on informed decision making. In the story, the Lacks family didn’t get the opportunity to decide what happened to Henrietta’s cells or how they were used. They didn’t deserved that, no patient does. Understanding forms that need to be signed is another role of ethical leadership. It’s your responsibility to make sure the patient is aware of different processes and the impact of their health decisions. As healthcare providers, you have a responsibility to make sure your patients know how genetic information is used and above all make sure consent is given before further research on tissue and specimens.\nConclusion\n“Hela” cells are responsible for many advances in the Health care industry and will forever be the most important discovery in science. Henrietta’s cells are immortal and through them she will live forever. We also want to remember her as a wife, mother and sister. As her cousin mentioned in the book, “Hennie, made life come alive, being with her was like being with fun.” (Skloot, 2010, pg. 43) She was someone before dying, she wasn’t just cells.\nPreventing unethical behavior from taking place is another key thing I learned after reading the book. Imagine, several experiments were done with Henrietta Lacks cells without informed consent. Understanding what unethical choices can do to a workplace is very important, you take a risk on losing credibility, patients, and possibly shutting down. Following a code of conduct is key, having standards in place for employee’s behavior gives them an outline to follow company structure. Leading by example is another way to foster ethical behavior within the workplace. Last, is respect for patients and their information. Valuing your patients is important, and respecting their information is vital. As healthcare professionals we must make sure another situation like Henrietta Lacks never happens again.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/112529/henrietta-lacks-and-health-care-leadership"},{"post":{"author":"fishdat","post_time":"1 month ago","post_title":"Worried sick about abdominal pain","post_content":"Started in Nov.

Well, I am one of them. I'm fortunate in that my cancer (adeno carcinoma) was discovered at stage 2. Most lung cancer is stage 3 or 4 by the time it causes enough symptoms to get victims to notice. In my case, a growing spot in my lungs was caught on camera (multiple CT scans over three years) as doctors were monitoring concerns about something else. My frustration was that it took three years for a doctor to call my attention to the fact I had this spot in my lung that was growing. Had a biopsy been done earlier, they likely would have caught the cancer at stage one, thus saving me from having to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy after my lobectomy. That's water under the bridge now. I'm closing in on three years cancer free following my lung surgery. I'm in a control group for a study of a cancer drug as adjuvant therapy. That gets me a little more thorough follow up than I might have had otherwise. I'm hopeful that the final chapter in my story will list me a s a cancer survivor.\n\nI'm not sure what might have contributed to me contracting lung cancer.

I have a lipoma, myself, located on my hand, and I wondered the same as you. Based upon my own reading, it appears that lipomas are relatively harmless (provided, at some point, it stops growing and no pain), tends to run in families and can pop up at any age and anywhere (mine started to grow at age 61; 63, now).\n\nIts outpatient cosmetic surgery to remove (15 minutes with local anesthesia) and there are no guarantees it won't grow back, again...or someplace, else!\n\nI suspected no ramifications because I'm in peak health and fitness for my age and maintain an inflammation free lifestyle. Thus, unsightly as it may be, I'm not planning to take steps to have it removed anytime, soon...\n\nSo, how can you be sure that a fatty tumor has not \"transitioned\" into malignancy, you wonder?\n\nMy thoughts run towards examining \"symptoms\" most commonly associated with malignant growths:\n\n#1. Fatigue\n#2. Pain\n#3. Presence of blood or discoloration\n#4. Loss of appetite\n#5. Significant changes in key vitals...weight, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, HDL, blood cell counts\n#6. Changes in regularity, color of stools or urine.\n\nThese are just the top, tell-tail signs. But, bottomline, contrary to what 99% of the population think and believe (because of ignorance), humans are not suppose to develop unusual conditions that progressively worsen and increase in intensity. lol\n\nSo, if you notice a change in how you feel or find noticeable indications of ongoing \"inflammation\", don't sit on your hands or remain in denial. These kinds or symptoms are, absolutely, not \"normal\" and, thus, require you to consult with your physician, asap.\n\nPS: my doctor did not diagnose lipoma; I did. I know my lump is fatty in nature and benign. I plan to see my doctor in the coming months, anyway.

Her story is compelling because Ms. Lacks's cells were essentially taken from her without her or her family's knowledge or consent and used for medical research. This research lead to the polio vaccine, the discovery of human telomerase, and has been a vital tool in other countless advances (Nature, 2019). Henrietta died at the young age of 31 and left behind 5 children and her spouse. In this article, we will explore the book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot as well as investigate several elements within the book.\nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\nImagine someone taking something very personal from you without your knowledge to use for research. This one thing however, revolutionized medical research. What's more, it was and still is used to help save hundreds of thousands of lives (and counting). This is what happened to Henrietta Lacks, as described in the non-fictional book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot.\nIn the book, Rebecca vividly describes home and personal life of Henrietta as a child all the way until her death in 1951. The book effectively illustrates the significance of Henrietta Lacks’s life through countless hours and interviews with the Lacks' siblings especially with, Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter to learn more about Henrietta and her family. Rebecca quickly realizes how badly the family had been treated by the scientific community and the media however, she promises the family and works with Deborah to uncover the truth of Henrietta's life, death, and the transmutation into immortal cells.\nRebecca portrays Henrietta and her family as a low-income under-educated group who did the best they could with what they had. The author notes the incestuous relationship between Henrietta and her cousin, David \"Day\" Lacks and talks about how this relationship may have led to the multiple health issues from several of the Lacks's children, notably Elsie Lacks who was born \"deaf and dumb\". This portrayal does not appear to be problematic however, it paints a grave description of what some family's households were like in the mid 1900's.\nUltimately, Rebecca ended up helping the family understand who their mother was, what contributions her cells had to science and research, and helped Henrietta and the Lacks family get the recognition that they longed deserved. With the help of Christoph Lengauer, a scientist who invites Deborah, Zakariyya, and Rebecca to see the labs in which HeLa cells are cultivated and studied he explained the basics of cell biology and shows the Lackes their Mother's cells through a microscope. Lengauer states in that it is important to know about Henrietta Lacks which happens to be something that the family agrees with (Skloot. 2010). The medical/scientific community and African Americans had such a broken trust that this outreach was a good step in rebuilding that trust.\nHow Learning About Henrietta Lacks's Story Helped Me Become a More Ethical Leader\nLearning about Henrietta Lacks and her cells helped me understand the importance of Informed Consent. During the 1950's Informed Consent did not exist and many people such as African Americans were treated unethically which forced them to view the medical community as unpleasant and even scary (Skloot, 2010). I think that this book helps us as leaders understand that people have varying perspectives and situations that can make seeking medical attention difficult or scary.\nThis book has helped me understand that as healthcare leaders, we need to be more compassionate and empathetic to our patients rather than brushing them off, such as one scientist did when he presented a scholarly book to Deborah, a under-educated individual simply stating to her that everything she needed to know was in the book (Skloot, 2010).\nPreventing Unethical Practices\nEthical issues can have a detrimental impact on the quality of patient care as well as the culture within any organization. Organizations can address these concerns by collaborating with leaders of various departments to discuss current issues and come up with resolutions. Another way to prevent unethical practices is to educate staff on Corporate Compliance and the various policies and procedures that the organization must adhere to (Conlon et al ,2008). Lastly, confidential reporting is another means to help prevent unethical practices. Employees should have the option to report anonymously to help nurture a blame-free environment. This in turn, may increase the number of reported events.\nThrough the book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks the reader was able to identify the multitude of unethical practices that occurred during the 1900’s. We learned about the life of Henrietta Lacks and her contribution to the science and medical community. Most importantly, the author was able to help the family find out more about their Mother and her cell’s contributions. To this day, we can contribute Henrietta’s immortal cells to an array of medical advances that are still used today.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/100608/immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"6 months ago","post_title":"Throat cancer","post_content":"Hey!

Cancer is so scary, especially when we can't just take a cold capsule, and go to sleep. The fear of knowing this is real, and that we may not survive; is painful and heartening.\n\nLet me see if I can describe how an cancerous cell operates.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with the term maggot, let me break it down.\n\nA maggot is a soft bodied legless grub that is the larva of a housefly. In other words, the embryo. Take it from me a person who observed a maggot up close, when it slimes it's way, is nauseating. A cancerous cell has similar functions. When our immune system began to deteriorate/break down/rotted/corrode; that's how maggot/cancer cell seeps in, and spread/grow throughout our body.\n\nWhat is our defense to this deadly disease - IMMUNE SYSTEM\n\nOur body was designed by our Creator to heal itself, with the right type of nutrients. May it be fruits, vegetables, or grains, there is a remedy; all we have to do, is find it.\n\nThis Vegetable Juice I called the Green Powerhouse. It taste nasty as hell, but it's effective.\n\nBlend together broccoli, kale, mustard, collard, spinach, one teaspoon of cayenne spice, one tablespoon of turmeric spice, one chopped garlic cloves, one half teaspoon of sage spice.\n\nBlend all ingredients with 100 percent Pure Orange Juice. Drink it twice a day.\n\nWhat this juice does is to kill and control the spread of new cancerous cells. Strengthen your immune system to combat all foreign invaders in our body.\n\nLet's not wait until the problem come to us, let's catch it in it's tracks.\n\nHave a bless day\nSha, Naturopathic specialist","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/96014/cancerous-cells"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"9 months ago","post_title":"A non-painful lump on anus","post_content":"Im very sorry for being gross but i didnt know where else i could ask this.

Genetic information is found within the cells of the body and consists of strands of DNA, which are used to perform analysis. Genetic changes can affect a person’s health; along with lifestyle and environmental factors; which is why genetic testing is used to make predictions about future health conditions. New innovations like CRISPR has made an impact on existing healthcare systems by treating and detecting diseases. It uses genetic testing, which allows researchers to figure out what causes a disease, how it can be treated, and who is more likely to develop a certain disease.\nWhat is Genetic Testing?\nGenetics is the science of how everyone receives traits from their parents (such as eye color, hair color, height, etc.). According to the American Cancer Society (2019), “Genetic testing is the use of medical test to look for certain mutations in a person’s genes” (What Is Genetic Testing, para.1). Just as a person’s genes affect their appearance, it affects their chance of disease. The NCBI website (2019) states, “If a condition is very common among family members, it could be a sign of a genetic predisposition. Genetic testing may be done in such cases. It can be used to determine which form of genes someone has and may share with their relatives” (Are You More Likely to Develop A Certain Disease, para. 1).\nThe Impact of New Innovations\nResearchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center discovered a break-through in gene-editing technology and possible disease treatment. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a new innovation used to deliver electric shock or viral vectors to edit DNA. Cancer patients have been treated by using CRISPR, as well as patients with sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Carfango (2019) states, “New medical technologies and innovations have greatly enhanced how scientists are able to work with genetics. Gene therapy treatments, analysis of fully sequenced genomes, and simplified genetic tests are just a few examples of how researchers are leveraging new capabilities to improve genetic healthcare (Intro, para.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDue to evolving patient needs, medical scientists continue to develop new innovations that contribute greatly to the health and well-being of the patient. Innovations, like CRISPR, were developed to treat and control disease, allowing medical scientists to treat patients with cancer and other diseases. Genetic testing was developed to stop the spread of disease. So much can be accomplished with genetic testing. Although lifestyle and environmental factors affect health, this technique can allow us to treat and prevent illness and disease before a child even leaves the womb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society, (2019).

All siblings healthy and intact. She was mother of 3, but lost one male kid at the age of 4.\n\nShe was very fit physically and topper in her studies and activities. Having limited resource she was doing whole hearted charity and feeding people was her passion.\n\n2003 Her mom was detected with non cancerous tumor in left Kidney and underwent successful removal of the same. My mom underwent Utrus removal surgery in 1998.\n\n2014 onward she was gaining more weight and her food intake discipline was not good and not balanced diet. She was always in stress, deep thoughts and getting irritated for small issues. She was started to find all sorts of disturbing things, watching painful TV serials, discussing more on friends family painful issues. This nature was totally unexpected and she started to irritate everyone in family. We got to know that she is having some imbalance and hormonal changes. She was very spiritual person and was doing her prayers very calm and quietly. But she was very reluctant to read spiritual texts though she was worshiping the same.\n\n2014-15 we took her to Gynecologist because of fatigue and Back pain. She did series of tests and everything was normal. Then she asked us to do Protein serum electrophorosys with complete heamogram. There was some visible evidence of Rheumatoid arthritis in her fingers. In test results we found ESR 26, slight high in Gamma globulin and M-Band 1.1. Doctor asked us to consult Heamotologist. We did the same. Heamotologist performed head to toe x-ray, Bone biopsy, scan but everything was normal. He asked us to repeat M-Band test once in 3 months and if any variation need to consult him as its very unlikely to get cancer. we believed him and started checkups once in 3 months consistently till Dec 2017. Everything was normal in that report.\n\nShe was very active in this time and her nature was very unpredictable and became very impatient. Because she was traveling and doing lot of activities she never expressed her pain and health issues with any of the family member. In 2017 Nov she complained severe pain in the left thigh and told its becoming unbearable each hr. we took her to neurologist and orthopedic they performed back bone xray and told things are fine. She was complaining that she had a fall recent past in Garden.\n\nThen due to uncontrolable thigh pain they asked us to do MRI where they found Major Pathological fracture at L4, Mass pressing near L4 and 35mm big mass in L kidney. They did Spinal fixation and told its RCC stage 4 metastasis.\n\nThey predicted 3 to 6 months life time by understanding her condition and never be able to walk out of the house. We decided not to disclose her metastasis condition. We approached many oncologists and urologist. Many sr doctors told live her at that don't experiment any chemical bombings on her it will become disaster.\n\nWe told her fracture fixation and a small tumor in her kidney if required will treat at a later part. She was very strong with will power. She accepted that situation as it is and started to follow whatever we asked her to do. we started ayurvedic Ashwagandha treatment for nerve stability and was giving her Vitamin C vegitables and avoid meat and sugar. Post surgery she was not able to sit on char more than 10 sec. slowly she was practicing to stand and walk and to sit more time as much as possible. within 35 days she was able to climb 2 storied building stairs. surprisingly there was no spread or growth in first 5 months and she was able to do her morning walk with grand daughter and play with them in house.\n\nShe was coming back on track without any onco treatment, in 6th Month she suddenly changed her behavior and was very stressful, lot of negative attitude all of a sudden. we made her sit quietly and pampered her. she was on phone every time with friends and sharing their pain which she was good at. After 1 months we took her to doctor following complaint of back pain.\n\nIn scan it revealed that there was a additional growth near kidney. then that growth never stopped. one year from the date of surgery spread was near to liver and in pelvic muscle.\n\nIn Dec 2018 she started vomiting whatever she eats. she was totally in liquid diet. Spirulina and Apple Carrot juice\n\nShe was getting edima kind of swelling everywhere in the body. I approched one sadhu in Himalaya and asked solution for her. He told its already spread in many place but he suggested one medicine which can control all swellings and other intolerable condition in a weeks time.\n\nI prepared medicine as per his instruction and gave it to my mother. Desi cow's Calf's urine (Calf should be on its mothers milk). Add Turmeric, Onion and Garlic. Boil to reduce 50 percent and give her one tea cup every day morning for 10 days. I did it and surprisingly all her swelling and other issues reduced to zero. She was vomiting all types of food but she never vomited Urine therapy medicine.\n\nIn Dec 2018 she started to have sever leg and back ache and was started to give Morphine 10 mg. She was very reluctant to take morphine and wanted to control pain in some other means. that time we suggested her to meditate by writing god name in ledger. She did nearly 17000 lines before her exit.\n\nThe day she started writing she told pain is reducing day by day and feeling better. Her vomiting lead to weakness and she was on bed most of the time. The lower back spread paralyzed her left leg. We told her what had happened to her without using the word Cancer. She was very calm and asked kids to remain unite and share happiness till last day. we were not able to control our self by looking at her bold stand.\n\nIn this period she read lot of spiritual texts. During her last days she wanted to tell us something but she was not able to. She was with us in home with Hospice care. She stopped her morphine 45 days before exit and she conquered the pain.\n\nLot of spiritual things happened in those days and she showed us the path towards truth. After her exit she is showing her presence with a unique sandle smell whenever we speak about her and remember her deeply. Some more key notes not shared intentionally because some spiritual things are very hard to understand by many.\nmy mail id enginium.mail at gmail.","like_count":"0","tags":["Lymphoma"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/91717/mother-renal-cell-carcinoma-stage-4"},{"post":{"author":"nick6104","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"2nd Opinion","post_content":"My recent prostate biopsy came back positive for cancer, on the Gleason scale 3+3=6.

(I left my city and went to SLC / Huntsman Center for a 2nd opinion from both a radiation oncologist and a surgeon who agreed treatment was needed ASAP. I just could not make the logistics work to have surgery there, but I had waited until after I made that trip and decision to select a local doctor and book consultation with him (nearly a month out,) followed by month-out surgery scheduling.

The two protein structures in the brain i.e. neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques are considered to hamper the normal cognitive activity of the brain. There are various therapeutic interpolations under investigation to thwart and treat AD. Secretases inhibitors are important agents that inhibit the development of senile plaques. β-secretase (BACE) inhibitors are in lime light for the drug development of AD. BACE initiates the production of Aβ, so its inhibition provides a valid target for the AD. BACE inhibitors viz. LY2811376, LY2886721, E2609 are in different phases of clinical trials.

I am a 29 year old male, very skinny, and have smoked for about 11 years now. Well for about 5 months now I've been experiencing very debilitating fatigue. It has progressively been getting worse. Sometimes I get chest pains if I exert myself too much, and in the past week I get pain if I breathe in real deep sometimes or if I straighten my back as I usually slouch. My legs feel light as my muscles aren't as strong and get tired easily if I try to lift any weight or anything like that. Almost a year ago I got really sick for a few days, and the strange thing about it was I only felt sick on the left side of my body for the most part, which makes me worry about my lymph nodes. I noticed a little over a month ago my lymph nodes are swollen on the left side of my neck and they still haven't gone down, although I don't think they have gotten any bigger. Also just within the past week I start to feel a little pain every now and then if I bend my head / neck a certain direction, but it's rather inconsistent, but it makes me wonder if it's my lymph nodes getting bigger or maybe a tumor growing slowly. I most certainly have some heart disease going on, but I'm very worried that it might also be caused from something like cancer. I constantly feel that tired feeling in my eyes that I used to only get from staying up at least a night back when I was healthy, and this just developed 2 days ago. Can anyone lend any insight or help to what is going on? I saw a doctor about 2 months ago and they did blood tests but they saw nothing wrong and said I'm physically healthy, which is obviously not the case as I at least have heart disease. I have almost had 5 heart attacks now in the past 5 months, although my doctor said he thinks it was a panic attack, I am 99.9% certain it was near cardiac-arrest.

I am sure there were aspects of her life that weren’t captured which would be expected but enough was captured to get an understanding of who Henrietta and her family were. I am sure it is challenging to write a book on someone whom has since passed and are relying on family and friends testimony.\nAs a reader, I didn’t see anything wrong with the portrayal of Henrietta Lacks and or her family. Skloot seemed to have done her research when it came to the Lacks’ family and she tried to capture as many aspects of Henrietta’s life as possible. I did read that there was backlash that Skloot wrote about the STDs that Henrietta had because of Day’s infidelity. That was a part of Henrietta’s life and according to the book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, syphilis may have played a part in Henrietta’s steady decline (Chapter 1). In conjunction to syphilis playing a part in Henrietta’s decline, Elsie was also affected by syphilis which could have had something to do with Elsie’s mental state in addition to Henrietta and Day being first cousins (Chapter 2). Also, the book stated that the radiation therapy that Henrietta was receiving for treatment made her infertile (Chapter 5). I found this to all be a part of Henrietta’s life and it shouldn’t be masked but used as a learning tool. The Hopkins teams failed to tell her this information prior to the treatments. I did enjoy that the book went back and forth from Henrietta’s personal life to the science world. It provided two sides of the story. I was appalled at some of the stuff I read concerning how researchers were conniving when finding patients to conduct research on. As a patient of Johns Hopkins, I didn’t know Johns Hopkins intent of the hospital, which I found to be applauding. During the late 40s and 50s it appears that the hospital took a turn for the worse and it tarnished Johns Hopkins reputation for a while. I believe that Johns Hopkins reputation has improved dramatically since.\nI do agree that it is important to know who Henrietta Lacks is because she has contributed so much to the health care world. Even though she never knew she was part of research she contributed more than expected. Learning the true story of the women behind one of the biggest medical controversies is important. The Lacks’ never had a chance to tell their story or explain how Henrietta’s cell were taken. Henrietta Lacks’ was a remarkable woman that was unfortunate to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of cervical cancer. The Lacks family should also be portrayed since Henrietta is not here to tell her story. They also suffered in the death of Henrietta and the scandal associated with her cells. Henrietta was kept a secret for so many years and she deserves to be recognized.\nLearning about Henrietta helped me to become a more ethical leader because it teaches you to humanize your patients. Regardless of whether you are a medical provider or a researcher you must understand that patients are not just bodies. Patients are humans that have families, jobs, friends, etc. Medical professionals sometimes desensitize themselves from their patients so that they don’t become “attached.” As a medical professional you have to understand how to balance your emotions. Compassion is an important factor in health care regardless of the type of care.\nThere are multiple ways for medical professionals to prevent unethical practices such as respecting people’s autonomy, protect confidentiality, and document. Respecting people’s autonomy includes providing clients with information they need to give their informed consent (Smith, 2003). If individuals are not competent to make decisions for themselves, then the person who’s giving permission must have access to the same information (Smith, 2003). A signed consent form does not substitute for the informing process, which should occur first, that includes situations where informed consent is implied (Smith, 2003). Medical professionals need to carefully balance the disclosure with their ethical obligations to protect their patients’ confidentiality (Smith, 2003). Ways to prevent confidentiality problems include discuss the limits of confidentiality, ensure the safe storage of confidential records, know federal and state laws, and obey mandatory reporting laws (Smith, 2003). Documenting information can be an important tool to disable a medical professional from facing ethical charges. A few tips about documenting information are only include germane information, never alter a record after the fact, and use documentation to your advantage (Smith, 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSmith, D.

If you call around to different family practice offices and explain to the appointment setters that you have a lump you recently discovered that you're afraid could be cancerous, they will most likely do everything they can to get you in to see the doctor right away (which in doctor office terms means within five days).\nMany family practice doctors accept walk-in patients so that's something else you could find out when calling around to different offices. Going to an urgent care is an option, but they'll most likely refer you to a family practice doctor and you'll be back at square one. Urgent care is for an acute condition that isn't life threatening, like a very bad case of the flu, a contusion that needs a few stitches, etc. Something like a lump may need ongoing care and tests that most urgent care facilities don't handle.\nHopefully you'll be able to find a family practice doctor in your area who is accepting new patients on a walk-in basis.

Pot smoking - although legal in many states now - is worse for your lung health than cigarettes due to a few reasons:\nOne reason is that cigarettes have a filter to trap a lot of the tar that one would inhale when smoking\nAnother reason is that all of the tar you breathe in when smoking pot goes deeper into your lungs than cigarette smoke because you inhale pot deeper and hold it in (longer).\nThe final reason pot smoking is worse than cigarettes is because, at least here in Nevada where it's legal now, there have been several fatal accidents in which the drivers admitted to ingesting pot the same day (or the day before - yea, okay).\nI'm not by any means saying cigarettes are good for anyone. I have smoked cigarettes for over 40 years and understand the addiction to them as well as the health risks and still I find it impossible to quit smoking.\nThis web site (Web MD) has bountiful information on many health conditions. You ought to try to find out everything you can about your new diagnosis. Educating yourself will help you understand what's going on with your body so you can take steps to better yourself, and that will probably help remove your obsessive thinking about it.\nThe Mayo Clinic also has a site that is reliable and trustworthy for factual information about health conditions, here's the page that the Mayo Clinic has for Pleurisy: Symptoms & Causes:\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pleurisy/symptoms-causes/syc-20351863\n\nTry not to let the things you read online scare you into even greater obsessive thinking about your condition. In the event that it does, remember this: I have a friend who I met over ten years ago who is my daughter's age. He was diagnosed with lung cancer over twenty years ago. Since his diagnosis, he has had one of his lungs removed and I used to feel overly empathetic towards him because of his condition. Well, I am happy to say that he has not allowed anything to stop him from being a \"normal kid\" and now that he's about 27 years old, he has married and has two beautiful children! He walks up steep hills, not without a struggle, but he finishes the race in his head, to make it to the goal, to win. That is 100% truthful in real life, and metaphorically.\n\nMy suggestion is to go back to your doctor, ask her what your prognosis is, and what you can do to help yourself get better. Keep pushing yourself. You are very young, in the grand scheme of things, and have a beautiful, full life ahead of you. Don't let a word \"pleurisy\" become your identity. Who were you before this? What things did you love to do? Who are the people you loved to hang out with? \"Pleurisy\" is not who you are, remember that.\nFind or renew your faith.

I have never smoked anything in my life and I have never tasted alchohol. I try hard not to let anxiety effect my every day life but for some reason I just can't bring myself to forget about this bump on my tonsil tissue. About 3 weeks ago I had the flu so I had a sore throat and just felt sick. I don't get sick often and honestly I had never looked into my throat before until I had that flu. I checked as my symptoms were dying down and I still had a minor sore throat. I noticed I had a lump on either my tonsil or really close to it. Its extremely small and hasn't changed in size for 2 weeks. At first it was swollen and red but its gotten smaller and the color is the same as my entire mouth now. Its about half the size of a pea I think. At first it stung a bit when I drank water and the water rushed across it. But now there is no pain at all. I have no difficulty swallowing and I have no other symptoms besides the bump being there. I prefer not to visit a doctor unless it is absolutely necessary so I thought i'd ask here first. The bump is the same color as the rest of the inside of my mouth. I don't even notice its there when I eat or drink. I've been monitoring my weight and nothing has changed there either. I still get around just fine and i'm not in pain. Whats been scaring me though is that i've used google a little too much and i've found out that some cancers are painless in early stages. I have never seen someone with cancer or seen what cancer looks like before. I've been extremely anxious and would like some reassurance so I thought i'd ask here. I should also say that I think at one point I had swallowed hot food too quickly and it actually burned that part of my mouth. I can't remember if this was before or after this bump appeared though. I get the feeling I burned it before the bump appeared. Sorry if some of this is vague I can provide a picture and answers to questions if they're necessary i'm not well versed in anatomy and I don't get sick often so this is very new to me. We don't have any problems that run in our family either aside from some anxiety disorders. I also was able to see my epiglottis for the first time when I rolled my tongue back it looks like everyone elses I think. I just didn't know if that was normal.

Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:\nThyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid\nHeart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations\nThyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range\nBlood work- all normal\nNose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.\nDuring that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away\nI had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)\nI experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)\nI still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)\nI noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too\nMy heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.\nShowed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.\nIt takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.\nSince this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something \"flow\" on my peripheral vision but bothers me.

Mayo Clinic recommends doing only ONE set per day (total of 7 reps) because the remaining muscle that holds back urine is not a naturally strong muscle -- and too many exercises can actually tire and weaken it.\n\nIf you are still having urination problems, and are doing many kegels per day, consider cutting back to just the one set for a few weeks and see if this brings on any improvement.

He was not considered a candidate for surgery based on some other health issues so they recommended chemotherapy, which he received as needed for the first three years. The cancer went into remission once during this time, but unfortunately came back.\n\nAbout one year ago, the doctors stopped chemo after my dad was hospitalized for weeks with clostridium difficile colitis. He did not receive any additional treatment after recovering from the C diff and we found out earlier this year that the cancer was spreading. He had no pain associated with the cancer during this time.\n\nThree weeks ago, he was hospitalized due to small bowel obstruction and they used a NG tube to drain the bile. The doctor’s feedback to us was that he would no longer be able to have bowel movements and their solution was to insert a PEG tube in his stomach for drainage (not feeding) so that he could go home and be able to drink and eat. They also recommended in home hospice care as a next step.\n\nAfter he was sent home, we did some additional research and asked the hospice nurse to try a stool softener. Since taking, my dad is having bowel movements almost every day. He was feeling pretty well until the last couple of days - he is losing weight drastically because he is not able to retain nutrients from the food he is eating because it is draining into the bag. He is not taking any pain meds because he says he is not in pain, just that he feels like he is starving to death and is getting weaker every day.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How can he retain nutrients with the PEG tube automatically draining anything he eats or drinks? The hospice nurse said an IV runs the risk of infection and does not recommend we proceed with that approach.\n\n2. How is he continuing to have bowel movements if he is not retaining anything he eats or drinks? Also, why did the doctors not try a stool softener when he was in the hospital initially?\n\n3. He has also been vomiting lately, typically after trying to eat something. We were under the impression that the PEG tube would help with nausea since everything he eats goes directly through it and not sitting in his stomach. Any idea as to why he is vomiting?\n\nThank you for reading and any feedback or information would be much appreciated.","like_count":"1","tags":["Colorectal Cancer"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/52028/small-bowel-obstruction-peg-tube-for-drainage"},{"post":{"author":"elwelp","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Skindisorder","post_content":"My 83 year old disabled husband has serious problems with his skin.

It did not require an effort, it just kinda came up by itself.

Should I be worried?","post_content":"Hello! I am a healthy 19 year old male with no prior history of health issues. My father died of esophageal cancer that metastasized to other parts of his body at 35 years old. No real history of medication, except for I did take a 6 month dose of Accutane to treat severe acne. This was about 1-2 years ago. So the problem started within this past year. The issue is that I have been experiencing painful and bloody bowel movements for a while now and it has gradually gotten worse over the past year. My mother is a nurse, so we have a habit of just \"toughing it out\", but I am beginning to get a little worried, considering how the problem has progressed and how long it has persisted. When I have a BM I experience a sharp pain in the rectal area, and bright red blood. The bleeding has been getting progressively worse over the past year to the point where tonight, after passing stool, a few drops of blood dripped into the toilet, and there was a substantial amount of blood on the toilet paper. Also, recently i have been able to feel a small bump near the anus. It is fairly small and hard. At first I thought hemorrhoids, but the symptoms only occur when having a BM. No pain, itching, or anything at any other time. This leads me to believe that it may be something more serious! I would be super embarrassed to go to the doctor and it just be hemorrhoids, but I am scared it could be something else.

I can vaguely remember the time where I felt my first node pop up near the back of my neck when I was 11 or 12. During that time I had no clue what a lymph node was and why there was this mysterious bump on the back of my neck. Slowly, as time progressed, more nodes began to propagate throughout my body to the point where I got really anxious. As of right now, I have nodes pretty much everywhere, neck, back of head, ears, under the collar bone, armpit, and groin. I have 4 on the back of my head, probably 6 around my neck, some near my ears, 4-5 under my jaw, 3-4 under my collar bone, 1 under my armpit, and about 5 around my groin. I think it began with the node on the back of my head and slowly, it began to grow all over my body. These nodes are painless and moveable that range from 1cm to 1 1/2cm and never grown bigger or smaller. I've been to probably four doctors (two of them were specialists) and they all assured me that it was normal, but I can't really wrap my brain around it. They couldn't identify the cause of these lymph nodes, but they did order blood tests and a chest x-ray which all came back normal. However, one of these tests was in 2016, which tested positive for EBV, but I don't think that's the cause of my swelling that's started late 2013. I've heard that you can't diagnose lymphoma with just a blood test, you have to get a biopsy done. I asked the oncologist for a biopsy, but she refused and said that the surgeon wouldn't operate on those nodes. Well now it's 2017, about 7 months since my last checkup and I'm still in paranoia. If only they could find the roots to the cause of these lymph nodes, I would probably be less stressed out. The only symptom I have is painless nodes which makes me believe it's one of those really slow growing lymphomas.

Also we can say your age and bad lifestyle is the most important factors for prostate cancer.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/32113/prostate-question"},{"post":{"author":"bloodymonkey","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Advice Is Needed (Adenoid-Cystic-Carcinoma/ Advanced Rare Cancer \\","post_content":"Hi, my dad was diagnosed with cancer early 2011, in June I believe, but the cancer had been present before June for around 18 months and was played off as an infection, unfortunately it was not, we have tried Beclofen, Ibuprofen, Pregablin, Buscopan, Oxycodone, Citalopram, Ranitidine, Duloxetine, Lidocaine patches, Fentanyl morphine patches, this is the medication my dad is on daily but unfortunately it is not working.\n\nLater in June on the MRI scan they discovered the large tumour, and further into the year on August 11th 2011 he had major surgery which lasted ten hours which resulted in my dad being placed into intensive care, and had resulted in total exoneration, his urethra, his bladder, his rectum & his prostate were removed resulting in an ileostomy and Indiana pouch as our surgeons margins weren't very clear, given 13 days of Radiotherapy before it had a stop put to it as it was a danger to his life, 6 weeks of relief after surgery was all my father had until his pain had gradually came back only much, much worse, we are suspecting the same turnout of Cancer but we fear it has spread to places that may be untreatable, upon early 2016 they discovered another tumour in my fathers right lung but have failed to remove it.\n\nSymptoms Include: Extreme Fatigue, Loss Of Appetite, Weight Loss, Tiredness, Insomnia, Agonizing Pain, Change Of Behavioural Patterns, Slouched Over, Severe Rectal & Pelvic Pain, Chronic Pain, Blood Detected In Urine, Water-like loose stools, blood detected in ileostomy (Sometimes), Inability to eat, Cannot walk very far without feeling tired or out of breath (Note: My dad was a very healthy man, so this is very out of place), When he has the chance to sleep he sleeps hours and it is difficult to waken him.\n\nAny advice or recommendations you could give would be appreciated, we don't know what to do as the doctors here won't do anything and their excuse is that they cannot find it, but it is the same pain in the same area in his pelvis and is working his way up his spine, his tumour had to be scraped off his hip (If they removed it traditionally, he would've bled to death)\n\nThank you, any help is appreciated.","like_count":"1","tags":["Prostate Cancer","Lung Cancer"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Advice Is Needed (Adenoid-Cystic-Carcinoma/ Advanced Rare Cancer \\","resp_content":"Hello, I am terribly sorry to hear of your situation dear, I haven't really had much experience in this field of this specific cancer however I have read about it.\n\nIt is rather shocking that they disregarded such a dangerous condition as an infection, I would be certain that even if the infection lasted more than about 3-4 weeks it would be very worrying.\n\nGoing to what you said about his surgery, I think you are correct in what you say, it is very possible that his cancer has mutated and came back more aggressively than before, if it has spread into untreatable areas then I would fear many things, again I'm so sorry you're having to go through this.\n\nThere is the possibility of laser therapy and other things such as freezing the infected cells to prevent growth could be of use to your father, seek out cancer fighting foods such as all manners of green vegetables, citrus, almonds, these are regarded as super foods, and might be able to help your father but I cannot guarantee it will, all the best, hopefully your father gets better soon.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n~Peter\n1\n"},{"author":"bloodymonkey","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you so much for your advice it is very much appreciated, my mum says thank you so much for your help, this is what we thought ourselves, nice to see someone agrees with us for a change, we will keep in touch if it's possible for more advice! ~L","resp_content":""}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/31997/advice-is-needed-adenoid-cystic-carcinoma-advanced-rare-cancer"},{"post":{"author":"healthx","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Types of blood cancer?","post_content":"Which are the 3 different types of blood cancer?","like_count":"0","tags":["Lymphoma","Melanoma","Leukemia"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Types of blood cancer?","resp_content":"There are 3 types of Blood Cancer:\n\n1.

At times, be that as it may, a few knobs turn out to be large to the point that they can:\nBe felt\nBe seen, regularly as a swelling at the base of your neck\nPush on your windpipe or throat, causing shortness of breath or trouble gulping\n\nAt times, thyroid knobs deliver extra thyroxine, a hormone discharged by your thyroid organ. The additional thyroxine can cause manifestations of hyperthyroidism, for example,\n\nUnexplained weight reduction\nExpanded sweat\nTremor\nAnxiety\n\nQuick or sporadic pulse\n\nA couple of thyroid knobs are carcinogenic (threatening), yet figuring out which knobs are dangerous isn't possible by indications alone. Most destructive thyroid knobs are moderate developing and might be little when they're found. Forceful thyroid malignancies are uncommon, however these knobs might be expansive, firm, settled and quick developing.\n\nAt the point when to see a specialist\n\nAlbeit most thyroid knobs are noncancerous (considerate) and don't cause issues, request that your specialist assess any irregular swelling in your neck, particularly on the off chance that you experience difficulty breathing or gulping. It's imperative to assess the likelihood of tumor.\n\nLikewise look for medicinal care in the event that you create signs and manifestations of hyperthyroidism, for example,\n\nSudden weight reduction despite the fact that your craving is ordinary or has expanded\n\nA beating heart\nInconvenience resting\nMuscle shortcoming\nApprehension or peevishness\n\nCauses\n\nThyroid organ demonstrating larynx and trachea\nThyroid organ\nA few conditions can make knobs create in your thyroid organ:\n\nIodine insufficiency. Absence of iodine in your eating regimen can now and then make your thyroid organ create thyroid knobs. In any case, iodine insufficiency is extraordinary in the United States, where iodine is routinely added to table salt and different sustenances.\n\nAbundance of ordinary thyroid tissue. Why this happens isn't clear, yet such a development which is now and again alluded to as a thyroid adenoma is noncancerous and isn't viewed as genuine unless it causes vexatious manifestations from its size.\n\nSome thyroid adenomas (self-governing or hyperfunctioning thyroid knobs) create thyroid hormones outside of your pituitary organ's typical administrative impact, prompting an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).\n\nThyroid pimple. Liquid filled pits (pimples) in the thyroid most usually come about because of worsening thyroid adenomas. Regularly, strong segments are blended with liquid in thyroid pimples. Growths are typically generous, yet they once in a while contain threatening strong segments.\n\nUnending irritation of the thyroid (thyroiditis). Hashimoto's ailment, a thyroid issue, can cause thyroid aggravation bringing about nodular amplification. This frequently is related with decreased thyroid organ movement (hypothyroidism).\n\nMultinodular goiter. \"Goiter\" is a term used to depict any broadening of the thyroid organ, which can be caused by iodine lack or a thyroid issue. A multinodular goiter contains numerous unmistakable knobs inside the goiter, however its cause is less evident.\n\nThyroid disease. In spite of the fact that the odds that a knob is dangerous are little, certain variables increment your danger of thyroid malignancy, for example, a family history of thyroid or other endocrine tumors. Other hazard components incorporate being more youthful than 30 or more established than 60, being a male, or having a background marked by radiation presentation, especially to the head and neck. A knob that is huge and hard or causes torment or uneasiness is more troubling as far as harm.\n\nDifficulties\n\nIssues gulping or relaxing. Vast knobs or a multinodular goiter — a development of the thyroid organ containing a few particular knobs — can meddle with gulping or relaxing.\n\nHyperthyroidism. Issues can happen when a knob or goiter produces thyroid hormone, prompting hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can bring about weight reduction, muscle shortcoming, warm bigotry, and tension or fractiousness.\n\nPotential inconveniences of hyperthyroidism incorporate an unpredictable pulse (atrial fibrillation); powerless bones (osteoporosis); and thyrotoxic emergency, a sudden and conceivably life-debilitating heightening of signs and indications that requires quick therapeutic care.\n\nIssues related with thyroid disease. On the off chance that a thyroid knob is carcinogenic, surgery is generally required. By and large, most or the greater part of your thyroid organ is expelled, after which you'll have to take thyroid hormone trade treatment for whatever is left of your life.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Risk Factor Of Thyroid Nodule","resp_content":"What kind of sign is it for 1 to turn into 5 n 6 months time\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/9695/risk-factor-of-thyroid-nodule"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Multiple Myeloma Treatment Questions","post_content":"I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in October, 2017.

Breast Cancer\n2. Prostate Cancer\n3. Lung Cancer\n4. Colon Cancer\n5. Pancreatic Cancer\n6. Head And Neck Cancer\n7. Bladder Cancer\n8. Brain Cancer\n\nOfcourse ,Cancer make our body hurt because of following reason:-\n\n1. Hair loss\n2. Scars from surgery \n3. Fatigue\n4. Skin changes, including rashes and burns\n5. Swelling of the face, arms, or legs \n6. Decreased physical skills, including athletic abilities, balance, and agility \n7. Weakness or loss of stamina \n8. Loss of a body part\n9. Weight loss\n\nThere are many different kinds of cancer. Most cancers form solid tumors, and these tumors usually start with a series of mutation in one of the body's own cells. These mutations allow the affected cells to start dividing uncontrollably, and often to avoid the body's normal defenses against them. Sometimes just the physical presence of the tumor itself is the biggest problem. On the heart or brain, for example, a big tumor can prevent the organ from functioning normally and can even cause death.\n\nMore often, however, what ends up killing the cancer patient is what's known as metastasis. This is when cells from a tumor separate from it, find their way into the lymph system or the bloodstream, and spread throughout the body. When this happens, the tumor is said to be malignant. (Benign tumors are those that do not spread. They can still cause problems in some cases, like the heart or brain.) Particular types of malignant tumors often \"metastasize\" to particular organs--for example, colon cancer tumors often metastasize to the liver. But cancer cells from malignant tumors can invade many different tissues, such as bone, lungs, spleen, and more.\n\nEach metastatic cell begins dividing and forming a new tumor in its new location. This is where the real problem is. Our bodies usually can't support the growth of that many tumors, and the tumors can disrupt the normal function of the organs they're growing in. If that happens, and if the disease is left untreated, the patient will die. Treating a patient who has malignant cancer is difficult, because the metastatic cells are actually the patient's own cells! Chemotherapies are usually designed to kill all rapidly dividing cells, but some rapidly dividing cells are normal, as in hair follicles and the stomach lining. This is why people taking chemotherapy often lost their hair and become nauseated. So the goal is to kill enough rapidly dividing cells to kill the tumors, but not so many that the patient is killed.\n\nFor More Information- https://goo.gl/9PM6Sg\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/30073/cancer"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Small lump on breast","post_content":"Hi,\nI'm 19 and a couple months or some weeks ago had noticed a small lump on my breast.

Details below. I was informed after my double mastectomy that the tumor they removed was non cancerous. Three nodes were tested morning of surgery (dye inserted) into nodes that surronded the nipple and all came back negative for cancer. Initial Biopsy of tumor and lymph node showed I had a cancerous tumor in my right breast and lymph node test same day came back negative for Cancer. For me it seems that Chemo really did its job. I was ultimately recommended to have 28 round of radiation. I did my research, a lot of soul searching and met with the radiologist who ultimately recommended radiation. I could not wrap my head around having radiation with the results I have. I am Cancer Free. It is hard to take your own health into your own hands when we know the experts and professionals are out there. But maybe my situation is unique? Or maybe my wonderful outcome is not the \"norm\" right now and more studies have to be done. But If I get cancer again one day, not one professional will be able to tell me if it is from getting radiation or not getting radiation. Would love to hear what others think and really I just wanted to share my journey. Facts from Radiologist are below.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 43 year old female with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the Right breast: UOQ, clinical stage T2N1, ER-weakly positive (5%), PR-negative and Her2/neu not amplified, grade III, s/p neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC-->T) followed by modified radical mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, with a pathologic complete response ypT0N0. US guided biopsy of her axillary node was negative, but given her clinical exam by (DR. General Surgeon) and MRI findings that were thought to be discordant with the biopsy results, I am operating under the assumption that she had node positive disease up front. Though a pathologic complete response is an excellent prognostic sign and omitting radiotherapy in this setting is currently under investigation, it is still considered the standard of care until results of NSABP B51 are available. As such, I have recommended course of radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. The rationale, risks, benefits, alternatives, and personnel of radiotherapy were described in detail. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

About 2 percent of thyroid cancers occur in children and teenagers.\n\n2. Gender: Women make up almost 75 percent of all thyroid cancer cases.\n\n3.Family History and Genetics: A family history of thyroid cancer increases your risk. There is also an abnormal gene called the RET oncogene that can run in families. The presence of this gene greatly increases your risk of developing the medullary form of thyroid cancer.\n\n4. Personal Thyroid History: A personal history of Hashimoto’s and/or goiter\nRadiation Treatments: for bone marrow, head and neck cancers, childhood cancers, and pre-1960 radiation treatments for acne, tonsils, and adenoids\n\n5. Radiation Exposure: Due to nuclear accidents, releases from atomic facilities, or weapons testing\n\n6. Iodine Deficiency\n\n7.

He hasn't been sick in probably 8 months; not even a low grade fever, runny nose, sore throat, headache, nothing. His only complaint is being tired all the time, but he's also on a football team and it's busy busy busy this time of year.

He has no other symptoms of illness at all and hasn't had any, but the lumps are still there and not decreasing in size at all. They don't hurt him and don't really bother him other than that they are noticeable. The doctor was just going to leave it at that, but I demanded that I needed some kind of answer.

Most people require surgical removal of all or part of the thyroid gland. If a patient has thyroid cancer symptoms such as a nodule and the diagnosis is still uncertain, it will sometimes be surgically removed if suspicion is high for the presence of cancer along with thyroid tissue often one of the lobes (lobectomy) – to determine if it is indeed cancerous. Surgery involves lobectomy or near-total thyroidectomy, in which the entire thyroid is removed except for the area of tissue around the four parathyroid glands that are located within the gland itself. If lymph nodes are involved, they will also be removed during surgery.\n\nRadioactive iodine is used after surgery to remove any remaining thyroid tissue in the case of papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. Larger doses can be used to destroy any cancerous cells that have spread beyond the thyroid gland. Because radioiodine is taken up primarily by thyroid tissue – including thyroid cancer cells other parts of the body are less affected. TSH suppression therapy reduces TSH levels in your body, which may help prevent the growth of any remaining cancer cells. This is done with lifelong thyroid supplementation – usually levothyroxine (Levothyroid, Synthroid, or Levoxyl). In addition to suppressing the pituitary gland’s production of TSH, levothyroxine also supplies the missing thyroid hormone needed after the gland has been removed and any leftover tissue has been destroyed through treatment.\n\nRadioiodine treatments aren’t an option for people with medullary cancer because thyroid C cells don’t absorb iodine. In this case, external beam radiation with or without chemotherapy is often used. Prognosis is fair to good. This type of treatment is often used for anaplastic thyroid cancer as well, the most aggressive and fastest growing type of thyroid cancer. Anaplastic cancer often can’t be helped by surgery by the time it’s diagnosed because it has spread too extensively. Radiation or chemotherapy may shrink anaplastic thyroid tumors slightly and make the patient more comfortable but the prognosis with this type of cancer is poor.\n\nFor More Information- https://goo.gl/62A1zh","like_count":"0","tags":["Prostate Cancer","Lung Cancer","Brain Cancer"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/29649/everything-you-need-to-know-about-conventional-treatment-of-thyroid-cancer"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"?

I am a 27 year old, otherwise healthy female. But for the last few months, I have been feeling nauseous and constantly run down. I went to a few doctors with no help, but finally I had one order a CT. They found a large mass in between my duodenum and jejunum, so they recommended an endoscopy. I had that, and they found a 6cm large polyp. I found out later that it's a tubulovillous adenoma. They couldn't take it out there because it was too big, but they biopsied it and the results came back no high grade dysplasia or carcinoma seen. They told me they still weren't sure, however, and that they would need to wait until the whole thing was removed to say for sure that it is or isn't cancer. I went to see a surgical oncologist to get ready for a bowel resection, but she has ordered a colonoscopy and lung CT scan first to rule out metastasis(the colonoscopy is done and everything was completely normal). The original CT showed a single large lymph node in the mesentery near my cecum, and she said that is concerning. She will need to remove this lymph node first and look to see if it shows cancer. If not, then she will perform the resection and determine if there is cancer in the polyp or in the lymph nodes surrounding the polyp. If so, then she will assume the cancer has metastasized and begin palliative care and chemotherapy.\n\nI guess the main questions I have right now are how likely is cancer? Are negative biopsy results very common? Could cancer spread to just one distant lymph node like that?

The urologist who did the surgery was confident there was no other cancer.\n\nThe CT scan taken prior to the surgery did reveal tiny lung nodules, something I had never heard of.\n\nOver the past 5 or 6 months, I've had a PET scan, several chest X-rays, at least 2 CT scans and an MRI. The results of the PET scan were inconclusive.\n\nThe most recent CT scan shows that the largest of the nodules has grown from 8mm to 10mm in the course of about 4 months.\n\nA needle biopsy was attempted in December but failed. The doctor missed the nodule, and while the lung was not punctured, it caused bleeding into the chest cavity. This required a chest tube and a 3-day hospital stay.\n\nMy oncologist is pushing me to make a decision - either another needle biopsy, an open biopsy, or start oral chemotherapy with a drug call \"Votrient\". I researched the side effects of Votrient and I'm not sure I want to put myself through that.\n\nNever has anyone said that this nodule is cancer. I feel like the oncologist is assuming it's cancer because it has increased in size. I don't want to start the chemo drug if it's not treating what it's intended for.\n\nI have no symptoms of lung cancer - no pain, no shortness of breath, no coughing up blood or inability to swallow. I have a cough attributed to the BP meds I'm taking - they all cause me to cough.\n\nOn top of all this, I can't make anyone understand that the cost of the first month's dosage of Votrient - nearly $7000.00 - is just not feasible for me. Yes, it's been approved by my health insurance; that amount is with insurance coverage. But that amount of money will wipe out half of my savings. I cannot put myself in that type of financial risk.\n\nI am a woman alone - widowed - with no children and no family close by. I want to be able to do things with friends, to travel to visit family. I don't want to be incapacitated by the side effects of a drug treatment that maybe isn't necessary, or left financially strapped trying to pay for the drug treatment.\n\nI guess I'm just asking for some encouragement or someone to tell me I'm not crazy to be confused.\n\nThanks.","like_count":"0","tags":["Lung Cancer"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Lung Nodule","resp_content":"Gave chemotherapy...side effects are lousy...possible you still have cancer...\nEnjoy life with friends and travel...better than hospital bed...people don't die from cancer---they live with cancer until they die.

Pain after eating near the bottom of my right rib, extreme gas 24/7, internal and external grade III hemorrhoids (I’ve had 3 surgeries to remove thrombosed hemorrhoids), bleeding ulcer near the GE junction of my esophagus 3 years ago that I was admitted to the ER for, excessive bleeding when passing stools (I assume are related to the hemorrhoids and possibly fissures), occasional nausea after eating, fatigue, just an over all “yucky” feeling that I can’t really explain, and I could go on. I had a colonoscopy and a esophagogastroduodenoscopy done today. The colonoscopy came back okay other than the multiple external and internal hemorrhoids that were found. The upper scope found gastritis, esophagitis, and a polyp in the 2nd portion of my duodenum. Biopsies were taken of all three, and the polyp was removed. I feel like my doctor is doing a good job getting to the bottom of whatever is going on. I was just wondering if anyone here has had any experience with these types of symptoms all combined together, whether it was you or a patient of yours that had them, and what it turned out to be.

I tried to treat the condition at home but it got to the point to where I just couldn't get ahead breathing wise and no matter what I did I couldn't take any air in. I'm 33 weeks pregnant and was having sinus tachycardia and still am. After being admitted I was told they'd have to keep me because my lab work came back strange and they wanted to monitor me. My white blood cell count was 17000 and my red blood cell count was 3.25. My platelets however were normal. Finally after I continued to get even sicker for two days I began having contractions and they were PAINFUL! So I was moved to labor and delivery and it was discovered I had a UTI. Because my heart pace was constantly above 120 they couldn't give me the shot to stop the contractions so I was given procardia instead and antibiotics. I felt better and slowly my breathing improved but I was coughing up blood and felt achey all over. I was released after 4 days even though my doctor strongly recommended I stay. He didn't feel right about my white blood cell count still being 16000. I felt okay and very homesick so I asked to leave and he allowed it. Now that I'm home I have the absolute worst pains and aches. It feels like my bones hurt and my muscles are heavy. I'm still coughing a lot and very little comes up sometimes with bits of blood. I am incredibly weak and have lost 7 lbs since being admitted into the hospital. I get very lightheaded and shakey and my pulse races for no reason.

Found i was anemic and had a couple deficiencies like vitamin D and b12.\nand that i had a little bit of an underactive thyroid. However my urine was a concern to my doctor because it had excess protein in it. He got me in for a Kidney appointment with a kidney specialist, however we never made it to the appointment due to my mother not having a way to take me, Everyone forgot about everything and i waved it all off after that. In those next months i had small bouts of issues where id feel ill randomly and then it would go away, and i chalked it up to simple PMS.\n\nAnother thing i should add, is my periods became wonky around november of last year aswell, where i went from a normal 28 day cycle to, 28 days and 33 days, it was pretty random but either 28 or 33.\nIn january i had a very light two day period which made me think \"what the hell\" and then it returned to normal the next month etc.\n\nI wasnt paying attention to much because i was completely distracted. June rolled by and i noticed my gums would start to bleed randomly. they would gush blood, all of my gums, all between my teeth,\nI was really caught off guard by such.\nand thats where that started. Its just the front of my mouth , i have no bleeding or swelling in the back gums. its really strange.\n\ni went to the dentist a couple weeks ago and they chopped it up to severe gingivitis. and did a large cleaning which did not help at all.\nI still am suffering with my gums.

It is about an inch to the right from my neck and an inch-ish from the base. (Actually, just feeling it now, I realize that the around leading from the base to the bump seems a little bigger than the other side. I didn't notice that before). I started getting headaches, which is not a normal thing for me at all, and told my doctor. She told me if the headaches get worse then I need to call again. Of course, they did and it got pretty bad for someone who never gets headaches.\nSo, I called her and she told me I need to go see a specialist and get a scan done. However, being a uni student, it got put on the back of my mind and I never did.\nI always chalked up the long headaches to something, like chlorine in the pool, or light being too bright. Often, they would either be at the base of my head, on the sides, and down my neck, or they would be right behind my eyes. I still have them, but I've gotten used to it.\nI noticed something else though, I keep getting more and more dizzy (vertigo?) spells when I get up when I am laying down, sitting up, or bending over, etc, etc. They started, like, not too bad, just a second or too. But now it gets to the point where I get so dizzy, I see black spots in my vision, my head gets so tight and I can't hear for, even though it seems like forever, probably just a couple seconds.\nThere was an incident where I was teaching swim lessons and yelling across the pool and I got that feeling suddenly. It was so bad, I got on my knees and curled up in a ball. My boss saw my across the pool but I couldn't see a thing because of the black spots.

It’s estimated that about 50% of our exposure to ionizing radiation comes from the world around us (like the sun, which you mentioned.) Another large proportion of exposure for the US population comes from medical tests, like CT scans and x-rays.\n\nWhile there is no study that links radiation exposure from medical tests to cancer risk at this time, many physician groups are concerned about the risks over a lifetime. CT scans, in particular, give a higher radiation dose than x-rays. In fact, 1 CT scan of your abdomen can expose you to the same amount of radiation as 80 standard chest x-rays.\n\nGiven all of this information, it is really important to talk to your doctor about choosing the best test to diagnose and follow your condition over time so that you have the least amount of radiation exposure. In some cases, these medical tests are essential. You just want to make sure you are balancing the benefits with the risks through an informed conversation with your doctor.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/10912/cancer-concern"},{"post":{"author":"kelvindamian","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"pls need help need to identify if this looks like skin cancer","post_content":"so the other day I was looking at my leg and I saw this spot where I thought I had a scar it had some black spots on it. its smooth and like a patch of light brown skin with black spots and at a specific part when I touch it, it hurts.

A goiter can imply that all the thyroid organ is swollen or augmented, or at least one swellings or protuberances create in a section or parts of the thyroid.\n\nThe thyroid organ is in the lower some portion of the front of the neck. It lies just before the windpipe (trachea). It has a privilege and left flap which are associated together by a restricted band of thyroid tissue. It is generally the state of a butterfly. You can't generally observe or feel an ordinary thyroid organ. On the off chance that the thyroid grows, it causes a swelling in the neck which you can see - a goiter.\n\nThe thyroid organ makes thyroid hormones - called thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are conveyed round the body in the circulatory system. Thyroxine and T3 help to keep the body's capacities (the digestion) working at the right pace. Numerous cells and tissues in the body require thyroxine and T3 to keep them working accurately.\n\nSorts of goiter\n\nThere are diverse sorts of goiter, each with different causes.\n\nDiffuse smooth goiter\n\nThis implies the whole thyroid organ is bigger than typical. The thyroid feels smooth however is bigger than ordinary.\n\nThere are various causes. For instance:\n\nGraves' infection - an immune system malady which makes the thyroid swell and make excessively thyroxine. In immune system issue your body produces proteins called antibodies which harm an alternate some portion of your body - for this situation, your thyroid.\n\nAggravation of the thyroid (thyroiditis) - which can be because of different causes. For instance, another immune system condition called Hashimoto's thyroiditis can harm the thyroid organ. Contaminations with germs, for example, microorganisms and infections can bring about various sorts of thyroiditis. Radiotherapy treatment to the neck can likewise prompt irritation of the thyroid.\n\nIodine lack. The thyroid needs iodine to make thyroxine and T3. In the event that you need iodine in your eating regimen, the thyroid swells as it tries to make enough thyroxine and T3.\n\nA few prescriptions, for example, lithium and amiodarone can make the thyroid swell as a reaction.\n\nGenetic elements - a few people acquire a propensity for a thyroid to swell. Specifically, it might swell on occasion of life when you may make more thyroxine and T3 - for instance, when you are pregnant, or amid adolescence.\n\nSome other issue which causes issues really taking shape of thyroxine or T3 may make the thyroid swell.\n\nNodular goiters\n\nA thyroid knob is a little irregularity which creates in the thyroid. There are two sorts:\n\nA multinodular goiter. This implies the thyroid organ has created many irregularities or knobs. The thyroid organ feels for the most part uneven.\n\nA solitary knob. Causes include:\n\nA sore. This is a non-cancerous sac-like swelling loaded with liquid.\n\nAn adenoma. This is a strong non-cancerous tumor.\n\nA cancerous tumor (uncommon).\n\nOther uncommon causes.\n\nGoiters and generation of thyroid hormones\n\nIn many individuals with a goiter, the goiter does not influence the measure of thyroid hormones that you make. You are then euthyroid, which implies you make the right measure of these hormones.\n\nIn a few people, the goiter is related with a variation from the norm of thyroid capacity. You may make excessively thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid) or too little (hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid).\n\nWhat are the indications of a goiter?\n\nMuch of the time there are no indications separated from the presence of a swelling in the neck. The measure of a goiter can go from little and scarcely recognizable, to extensive.\n\nMost goiters are easy. In any case, a kindled thyroid (thyroiditis) can be excruciating.\n\nOn the off chance that your thyroid makes excessively or too little thyroxine or T3, this can bring about a scope of side effects. See isolate pamphlets called Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid) and Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid) for more points of interest.\n\nA substantial goiter may push on the windpipe (trachea) or the neck (throat). This may bring about trouble with breathing or with gulping.\n\nMULTINODULAR Goiter\n\nA multinodular goiter\n\nSide perspective of a goiter\n\nSurveying the circumstance\n\nWhen you have a goiter, a specialist will for the most part do some blood tests to check in the event that you are making excessively or too little thyroxine or T3. Blood tests may likewise discover the reason for a few goiters. Different tests might be done to discover the reason for the goiter. For instance:\n\nA ultrasound sweep of the thyroid. This is the best test for thyroid swellings. A ultrasound sweep is a sheltered and easy test which utilizes sound waves to make pictures of organs and structures inside your body. It can tell if a knob is a sore or a strong bump.\n\nA little bit of tissue (a biopsy) might be taken from a knob to take a gander at under the magnifying lens. The biopsy is finished by embeddings a thin needle into the knob. It is a basic and safe methodology. The master doing the biopsy can see where they are embeddings the needle by doing a ultrasound check in the meantime.\n\nPeriodically other expert blood tests are expected to help set up the cause. Infrequently a CT filter or a MRI sweep is required.\n\nWhat is the treatment for a goiter?\n\nTreatment relies on upon the cause, the measure of the goiter, and whether it is creating manifestations. For instance:\n\nOn the off chance that you have a little goiter that is not because of a cancerous knob, and your thyroid is making the right measures of thyroid hormones then you may not require any treatment.\n\nYou will require treatment on the off chance that you make excessively or too little of your thyroid hormones.\n\nAn operation to expel a few or the majority of the thyroid might be an alternative sometimes.\n\nRadioactive iodine treatment might be a possibility for a goiter bringing about an overactive thyroid:\n\nThis includes taking a drink, or gulping a case, which contains radioactive iodine.\n\nThe radioactive iodine develops in the thyroid organ.\n\nAs the radioactivity is packed in the thyroid organ, it devastates some thyroid tissue.\n\nYou may need to take thyroxine tablets in the wake of having radioactive iodine, if a lot of the thyroid is decimated.\n\nIn the event that you have cancer of the thyroid, you will presumably require an operation to evacuate the cancer and a portion of the thyroid organ.\n\nIodine substitution is given if the goiter is because of absence of iodine in the eating routine.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8794/what-does-mean-to-have-enlarged-thyroid"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"PSA levels","post_content":"Can someone tell me what are typical variations in PSA levels - from week to week, or month to month, or test to test, etc.?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8747/psa-levels"},{"post":{"author":"brownidgul","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Blood clot in breast after lumpectomy surgery","post_content":"I recently had a lumpectomy went for my two-week check-up bruising and swelling still there following week went to Medical oncologist and radiation oncologist both confirmed a blood clot this morning breast is harder and blood clot is visible is this normal what are the next steps","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8738/blood-clot-in-breast-after-lumpectomy-surgery"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Scab on scalp that won't heal","post_content":"About a month ago, I had a, I think, sebaceous cyst on my scalp rupture by itself.

Papillary carcinoma\n\nPapillary carcinoma is the most well-known type of thyroid cancer, representing roughly 80 percent of cases. Papillary carcinomas are moderate developing, separated cancers that create from follicular cells and can create in one or both flaps of the thyroid organ. This kind of thyroid cancer may spread to adjacent lymph hubs in the neck, however it is for the most part treatable with a decent visualization.\n\n2. Follicular carcinoma\n\nFollicular carcinoma is the second most basic kind of thyroid cancer, and records for roughly one out of 10 cases. It is discovered all the more as often as possible in nations with a lacking dietary admission of iodine. Follicular carcinoma is likewise a separated type of Thyroid Cancer. Much of the time, it is related with a decent forecast, in spite of the fact that it is to some degree more forceful than papillary cancer. Follicular carcinomas don't generally spread to adjacent lymph hubs, however they are more probable than papillary cancers to spread to different organs, similar to the lungs or the bones.\n\n3. Hurthle cell carcinoma\n\nHurthle cell carcinoma, otherwise called oxyphil cell carcinoma, is a subtype of follicular carcinoma, and records for roughly 3 percent of every single thyroid cancer.\n\n4. Medullary thyroid carcinoma\n\nMedullary thyroid carcinoma creates from C cells in the thyroid organ, and is more forceful and less separated than papillary or follicular cancers. Roughly 4 percent of every Thyroid Cancer will be of the medullary subtype. These cancers will probably spread to lymph hubs and different organs, contrasted and the more separated thyroid cancers. They likewise as often as possible discharge abnormal states calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen , which can be distinguished by blood tests.\n\n5. Anaplastic carcinoma\n\nAnaplastic carcinoma is the most undifferentiated type of Thyroid Cancer, implying that it looks the slightest like typical cells of the thyroid organ. Accordingly, it is an exceptionally forceful type of cancer that rapidly spreads to different parts of the neck and body. It happens in roughly 2 percent of thyroid cancer cases.\n\nFor more Details: http://thyroidnation.com/","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8625/types-of-thyroid-cancer"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Your Skin and Sun Damage","post_content":"We show you how getting too much sun can take a toll on your skin, from sunburn to wrinkles to skin cancer: http://wb.md/2r9EGOt\n\nHow much time do you spend out in the sun?","like_count":"0","tags":["Melanoma"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8442/your-skin-and-sun-damage"},{"post":{"author":"saharwebb","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Overview Of Thyroid Cancer","post_content":"Thyroid Cancer Symptoms\n\nSome thyroid cancer signs and indications incorporate a dry voice, neck torment, and developed lymph hubs. In spite of the fact that as much as 75% of the Cold knob in thyroidpopulation will have thyroid knobs, by far most are considerate. Youngsters more often than not don't have thyroid knobs, however as individuals age, will probably build up a knob. When we are 80, 90% of us will have no less than one knob.\n\nThyroid Cancer Prognosis\n\nMost thyroid cancers are exceptionally treatable. Indeed, the most widely recognized sorts of thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular thyroid cancer) are the most reparable. In more youthful patients, both papillary and follicular cancers have an over 97% cure rate if treated suitably. Both papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are regularly treated with finish evacuation of the flap of the thyroid that harbors the cancer, notwithstanding the expulsion of most or the greater part of the opposite side.\n\nBasically most thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid cancer, and this is a standout amongst the most reparable cancers of all cancers. Treated accurately, the cure rate is to a great degree high.\n\nMedullary thyroid cancer is altogether less normal however has a more terrible forecast. Medullary cancers tend to spread to vast quantities of lymph hubs from the get-go, and consequently require a significantly more forceful operation than the more limited thyroid cancers, for example, papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.\n\nThyroid Cancer and Chemotherapy?\n\nThyroid cancer is one of a kind among cancers. Actually, thyroid cells are special among all cells of the human body. They are the main cells that can ingest iodine. Iodine is required for thyroid cells to deliver thyroid hormone, so they retain it out of the circulatory system and focus it inside the cell.\n\nMost thyroid cancer cells hold this capacity to assimilate and focus iodine. This gives an impeccable \"chemotherapy\" system.\n\nRadioactive Iodine is given to the patient with thyroid cancer after their cancer has been expelled. In the event that there are any typical thyroid cells or any staying thyroid cancer cells in the patient's body (and any thyroid cancer cells holding this capacity to retain iodine), then these cells will assimilate and think the radioactive \"noxious\" iodine.\n\nSince every single other cell of our bodies can't assimilate the poisonous iodine, they are unharmed. The thyroid cancer cells, be that as it may, will focus the toxic substance inside themselves and the radioactivity wrecks the cell from inside—no infection, balding, queasiness, looseness of the bowels, or agony.\n\nOutline of Typical Thyroid Cancer Treatment\n\nThyroid cancer is normally analyzed by staying a needle into a thyroid knob or expulsion of a troubling thyroid knob by a specialist.\n\nThe thyroid knob is taken a gander at under a magnifying instrument by a pathologist who will then choose if the knob is generous (95% to 99% of all knobs that are biopsied are kindhearted) or threatening (under 1% of all knobs, and around 1% to 5% of knobs that are biopsied).\n\nThe pathologist chooses the kind of thyroid cancer: papillary, follicular, blended papilofollicuar, medullary, or anaplastic.\n\nThe whole thyroid is surgically evacuated; now and then this is done amid a similar operation where the biopsy happens. Your specialist will evaluate the lymph hubs in the neck to check whether they additionally should be evacuated. On account of anaplastic thyroid cancer, your specialist will help you choose about the likelihood of a tracheostomy.\n\nThyroid Cancer Conclusion\n\nIn case you're determined to have thyroid cancer, your specialist will make a thyroid cancer treatment get ready for you—one that may fuse a blend of thyroid cancer medications, for example, radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/8416/overview-of-thyroid-cancer"},{"post":{"author":"aglowaski1","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"I need advice on getting a colposcopy and cervical cancer","post_content":"My recent PAP test showed abnomal squamous cells and an HPV test came back positive.

Smith, MD, MBA, CPT","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Can heredity play into cancer susceptibility?","resp_content":"Hi Alexmoen,\n\nThe issue of cancer heredity is a bit of a complicated one. Despite how cancers seem to run in families, it's actually pretty uncommon. Cancer is a common disease so it can sometimes seem like it \"runs in families\" but there may be something else going on. For example, perhaps they share some similar risk factors, like smoking or obesity. Only about 5% to 10% of cancers are thought to due directly from gene defects that run in a family (inherited from a parent). All that said, the fact that the cancers are all on your mother's side of the family and at least most of them seem to fall into what we call blood cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, suggests there might (big might) be something going on regarding heredity. But unfortunately it's a tough thing to know for sure since we typically don't know what causes cancer. So in all likelihood, you don't need to be concerned anymore than the rest of us. In the meantime, do what the rest of us should be doing to help prevent cancer. Don't smoke.

Around 100,000 of these cases are melanoma, which slaughters somewhere in the range of 8,000 U.S. inhabitants a year. Furthermore, the issue is developing.

The sun to be sure can give your body vitamin D, yet you can likewise get this imperative supplement effortlessly from drain, squeezed orange, salmon, fish, eggs and Swiss cheddar. Also, think about your kids: Childhood sunburns raise the danger of grown-up onset skin cancer.\n\n3.

More terrible, studies now demonstrate that amid the day, sunscreen infiltrates further into your skin, really enabling the sun to accomplish more harm than if you hadn't connected it.

In the midst of all the clashing exploration, wellbeing specialists still prompt utilizing plentiful sunscreen with a SPF of no less than 30, applying it 30 minutes before going out, and reapplying at regular intervals.\n\n4.

Tans prompt wrinkles, in any case, and they don't ensure against skin cancer. Actually darker skin offers some assurance. So melanoma is less regular in African-Americans, Latinos, and Asians, however it is deadlier for them since it will probably create undetected.

That feeling comes and goes and at this moment i'm not exactly sure if there is any action that triggers it, I do know that sometimes when I exercise it becomes a sharp pain that last for a couple of minutes similar to the pain you get while exercising without a proper warmup, all focused in the same spot on my back.\nTaking deep breaths can be enough to experience the discomfort in that particular place but I also have a more generalized pain in the left side of my chest and back that I can feel to to the touch and especially when I take deep breaths or strech my upper body (I think is pleurisy).\nIn addition to that I have been experiencing irritation in my airwaves mainly in my esophagus/throat, sometimes I feel pain in that canal around the chest area( to be more precise, where both nipples would join if you drew a a straight line between them).\nAnd finally a couple of months ago I found a little bit of blood in my sputum and this got me really scared, ever since I've been extra aware of any phlegm I migh expel while coughing (this has become a habit for my and I cant seem to get it out of my mind, actually I think that the constant induced cough could be contributing to my general airwave irritation and eventual blood in the sputum). The blood has appeared again in a couple of occasions over the course of the last week, those times its been a more significant amount (about a teaspoon mixed with the sputum, Bright red fresh looking blood).\nI think I have a little shortness of breath at nights but at this moment im not sure if it could be my anxiety talking since I dont feel any harsh difference in my endurance while I exercise (apart from the pain in my back I mentioned earlier).\nBasically, those are my symptoms. I'm really scared of the perspective of getting worse and not being able to do much about it. I really hope this is just a big coincidence but I would like to hear from someone who has more knowledge about lung cancer if they have experienced any similar symptoms and basically how alarmed should I be.\nTomorrow I will go get a Chest X Ray which is one of the few available tests I can get, and visit a doctor ASAP.\nI'm 26 years old, male, heavy smoker (cigarettes and weed) for the past 10 years (I stopped cold turkey about a week ago out of sheer fear).\nIf someone can give me a professional or empathetic opinion I would be really grateful.\nMy thanks in advance.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/7932/a-little-help"},{"post":{"author":"169sandeep","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"i want to b sure Is there any chances of cancer","post_content":"Friends .

Don't trigger the unknown! #cancerprevention","post_content":"Cancer continues to be one of those diseases that evokes a sense of fear & finality. Although an increasingly large number of cancer patients have successfully overcome the disease, it continues to be one without a long term preventive remedy. The world has witness an unprecedented number of Cancer patients & Cancer-related deaths over the last few decades. The disease has not only spread in numbers but also in different forms and variants. Some of the variants are not some of the most deadly diseases worldwide. There are more people affected by the disease across the globe and there are well over 100 types of cancers known currently.\n\nWhile the verdict is out on the exact causes of Cancer, it can be largely agreed that – lifestyle, hereditary factors, hormonal imbalances & hygiene factors play a crucial role in causing Cancer. An effective strategy to keep this factors in check – is largely accepted as the go-to method of preventing Cancer.\n\nLifestyle is one of the most fundamental and largely ignored facet of Cancer. Most Cancer causing factors could well be eradicated, if people follow a healthy and smart lifestyle. Lifestyle and environmental factors alone account for over 90% of the Cancers worldwide. A healthy lifestyle includes – appropriate diet, regular exercise, stress management, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption and work-life balance. Lifestyle also includes a healthy work environment with no exposure to excessive pollution, infections and radiation.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspect of a healthy lifestyle is to stay away from tobacco, narcotics and excessive alcohol consumption. Tobacco is known to be the cause in over 30% of Cancers, while the same for lung cancers stands at 90%. Cancers of the throat, bladder, kidneys and pancreas is also known to have a higher incidence in patients with smoking & chewing tobacco.\n\nOver the past three decades, the lifestyle of people has undergone a vast change with obesity, lack of exercise and sedentary habits taking precedence. Global warming has increased exposure to radiation – resulting in 1 in every 10 cancer patients reported to have been exposed to ultraviolet radiation and most non-melanoma skin cancers are due to the over-exposure to radiation from direct sunlight.\n\nFollowing, lifestyle, genetics plays a crucial role in the development of cancer cells in the body. These include breast cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. If you are suffering from any Cancers, it is best advised that your progeny takes care. Minimizing other risk factors can be a successful deterrent.\n\nLifestyle & genetics together determine hormonal agents in the body that could be the cause of certain cancers. Lifestyle also includes our living & surrounding environs. Cleanliness, personal hygiene and community health allows for a higher preventive barrier of Cancers.\n\nDespite all the advances in medical science, Cancer still evokes a sense of the unknown, of the unthinkable. Prevention of the diseases is not just possible but also highly recommended.\n\nThis #miscalculation will cost your dear. Don't chew your life away!\n\nJust one swig at a time! Under peer pressure or simply for the thrill of the smoke. For the heady high it is supposed to deliver or the innocuous habit it becomes over a period of time. Consumption of tobacco – smoked or chewed – is the surest way of lighting up your own life. A perfect metaphor or a slow, self-inflicted death.\n\nTobacco is known to contain over 700 harmful chemicals, including cancer-causing agents such as benzene, cadmium, nickel, arsenic and others. Cigarette affects almost every single organ in the body and is known to cause Cancer of the lungs, esophagus, larynx, mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, liver, pancreas, stomach, cervix, colon, and rectum. Additionally, there is a risk of heart, kidney and liver diseases.\n\nSmoking affects not only the smoker but also passive individuals in the near-vicinity. Family members, children and colleagues are highly susceptible to the long term effects of passive smoking or secondhand smoke. Not only smoking, tobacco and related products are often consumed orally. Chewing tobacco is just as harmful and is the leading case of oral & throat cancers.\n\nTobacco usage is a miscalculated step, which is perfectly avoidable but often transgressed. It is a lose-lose situation wherein you pay for your own downfall and later struggle to quit the habit, often unsuccessfully. The habit not only robs you of your money, it steals your time from family and with continued dependence it strikes hard at your own self-worth.\n\nMovies & fiction, might glamourize cigarette smoking and your peers might give you a hard time if you don’t indulge in it! But rest assured, smoking is both a miscalculated and misguided step – one that you are better off, staying far away!","like_count":"0","tags":["Colorectal Cancer","Lymphoma","Bladder Cancer","Prostate Cancer","Melanoma","Breast Cancer","Cervical Cancer","Lung Cancer","Brain Cancer","Ovarian Cancer","Leukemia"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/cancer/6710/don-t-make-your-lifestyle-genes-hygiene-and-hormones-gang-up-against-you-don-t-trigger-the-unknown-cancerprevention"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"After treatments bleeding","post_content":"My husband finished treatments for the prostate cancer a little over a year ago and he is still bleeding when he urinates..is this normal.

It is weird though that you haven't had already an x-ray test (or have you?). What I would recommend is to stop smoking anything at least until you get better. The last day I smoked was in New Year's and it has actually helped me a lot, I was actually too scared because I coughed a little bit of blood once with all the mucus, I wouldn't had gone to the dr. otherwise.

The only person you NEED to tell about your smoking is your doctor. As for your symptoms, I do suggest you tell your parents and asking your PCP for a referral to a specialist. Trust and believe, your parents would rather hear unpleasant news about your symptoms and smoke usage then NOT know, not have you see the appropriate doctors, and there be an issue. That many instances of strep is not necessarily normal, and producing thick, mucus is a sign of a chest infection. I suggest seeing a pulmonologist for your chest infecton AND an Ear, Nose & Throat doctor for your strep. There could be multiple things at play that are treatable if you put in the extra effort to get them rectified.

It can be caused by a couple of other conditions: prostatitis and BPH (enlargement). I'm not a doctor, but if a person is diagnosed with prostate cancer, and yet sees a downward trend in their PSA, I would guess that he is seeing a natural ebb in prostatitis and that's where the drop in PSA is coming from. I would also assume that the trend is temporary. Some prostate cancers do not produce a lot of PSA (i.e. it's possible to have both prostatitis/BPH and prostate cancer simultaneously, and if the cancer is a low producer of PSA, the changes in PSA from the other will be more noticeable).
