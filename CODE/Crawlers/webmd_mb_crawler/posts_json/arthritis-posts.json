It wasn’t serious/long lasting. Every time my mom has the back pain, she put on a pain relief pad (those cheap kind you can get from Chinese pharmacies or Rite Aid. She used various kinds, and they seemed had worked in the past).\nNow the pain relief pad doesn’t help anymore. The back pain (again in the lumbar spine area) is getting worse, and even her knees are getting pain as well.\nWe went to different doctors (3 internal medicine (primary care provider), about 5 specialist including orthopedics, neurologist, physical therapist, acupuncturist, and cardiovascular doctors), no one is able to diagnose what exactly is wrong with her.\nHer situation is getting increasingly worse. Here are her symptoms and hope there’s someone on WebMD platform could offer some opinion or just point to a direction.\nShe couldn’t sleep well at night for the past 5 or 6 months.

Maintain a healthy weight.\nToting around excess weight places tremendous pressure on your knees. “For every pound of weight you put on, the knees will have four more pounds of force on them and even more than that when you go up or down stairs,” says John-Paul Rue, an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore. The flip side is true, as well. For every pound of excess weight you lose, you'll spare your knees from having to cope with four additional pounds of extra force.\n\n2. Keep moving.\nRegular physical activity helps maintain joint function, including strength and range of motion in the knees, which “means less force gets applied to the knee,” Bhatia explains. Although it used to be believed that high-impact activities such as running are bad for the knees, the latest evidence shows that's not necessarily true. But there is a sweet spot for runners: A meta-analysis of 17 studies, published in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, found that recreational runners had a much lower risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee than competitive runners and sedentary people did. “If you run, don't run on successive days; do it every other day, because we don't recover as well as we're aging,” Cardone points out. It's also wise to mix up your workout routines; so if you run three times a week, do something low-impact, like bicycling, Pilates, swimming or using the elliptical machine, on the in-between days.\n\n3. Strengthen the muscles that support your knees.\nDeveloping strong thigh muscles — especially the quadriceps, hamstrings and abductors — improves range of motion, protects knee cartilage and reduces the stress you place on the knee, says Richard Willy, an assistant professor of physical therapy at the University of Montana School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences. Get in the habit of doing squats and lunges twice a week, making sure that your knees stay above your feet and don't extend in front of your toes. After age 50, avoid squatting below a 90-degree angle (with your hips dropping below your knees), because deep squats increase pressure on the knees, Cardone warns. If you prefer to use weight machines, opt for the leg press, hamstring curl, knee extension and outer-thigh (abductor) machines, Willy advises.\n\nFor expert tips to help feel your best, get AARP’s monthly Health newsletter.\n4. Perfect your posture.\n“People often slouch or get more stooped over as they get older,” Cardone says. This is problematic because poor posture changes your body's center of gravity, placing added stress on your knees and hips. So make a point of standing tall, with your head in line with your shoulders, your shoulders directly over your hips, your hips aligned with your knees, and your knees aligned with your feet. Doing “Pilates, yoga, tai chi and core-strengthening exercises such as planks and back extensions can help improve your posture, prevent irritation under and around the kneecaps, and help you avoid falling,” Cardone adds.\n5. Choose the right shoes.\nWearing supportive, comfortable shoes promotes proper alignment of the joints in your lower extremities as you move, explains Barton Branam, M.D., an assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Cincinnati. For exercise, choose kicks that suit your activity — say, running shoes for running — and that are appropriate for your gait and foot (whether you pronate or supinate, for example), Branam advises. Believe it or not, research suggests that postural abnormalities of the feet can contribute to knee osteoarthritis, which is why it's important to wear shoes that help prevent inward or outward rolling of the feet during movement. If you're in the market for new exercise footwear, it's a good idea to get professionally evaluated and fitted by someone at a top-notch running or sporting goods store, Branam suggests. When you're not exercising, avoid high heels, which increase the load that's placed on your knees, Willy says.\n\n6. Listen to your knee pain.\nIf you develop pain and swelling in your knee, take a break from walking, running or any other high-impact activity you're doing. Give your knee the RICE treatment — rest, ice, compression and elevation — and take an anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen, Rue advises. “If it gets better on its own, you can go back to what you were doing,” he says. If it doesn't respond in a week or two, have it looked at by a doctor. In the meantime, you can continue to exercise by doing a gentle activity, including swimming, aqua aerobics or bicycling, Willy says, so that you don't lose any of the fitness you've been building.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published on September 20, 2019.

What happensed to him was the ankle on either extremity would swell up to the point I actually thought he could have possibly broken it , he was in excruciating pain and could not bear the touch of a hand let alone walk took him to the er and found nothing at all wrong they did exrays and checked him all out told me to take him home wait 24 hours and see if the swelling went down .if it didn't bring him back. Within the 24 hours it went down he was playing again as if nothing happened for about a day then the knee on the opposite leg did the same thing took him to the er and found nothing told them about the first incident so they suggested the 24 hour wait mind you this baby is in so much pain I could not even touch him we would both just cry all night long me because I could not comfort him no sleep what so ever I give him motrin and Tylenol for the pain per the doctors . Same thing swelling down and all all was good in about 24 hours. 2 days later it happens again to the ankle on The opposite foot from the first one. This time we went to a different er they found nothing give him steroids and benadryl and told me motrin for pain and if not better in the 24 hours bring him back this went on 6 times in a week and a half period we were so tired from no sleep, by this time we went back to the first er and i was so frustrated I was not going home till they told me what was wrong. But on the sixth time it was different the whole lower half of his leg swelled and he he got this red rash and he had big lumps all up and down his leg, goose egg sizeded covering the whole lower half I was freaking out I could not get him to the er fast enough. A doctor came in looked at it I told him the history of the last 2 weeks and he went and got another doctor to confirm his suspicion they said 2 kids were recorded dead from this the same week so now i am really freaking out and they had 2 other cases in there hospital the same week it was called leukocytoclastic vasculitus they kept him on the steroids and just told me to give him motrin and tylenol like i was there wasnt really nothing we could do except try and control the pain they said it could go away in a week or 2 or it could last several moths or even several years. The next day we went his pediatrician and he looked it up in the medic book and actually printed off the pages for me and to confirm that was indeed what it was and that as he got older it could affect his physical activity in sports and exercise. The bacteria in the flu the way I understood it was attacking the blood vessels and that's were the rash and big lumps came from. I don't know if this is at all what you have but it is worth checking out since it's rare.

You haven't taken the time to understand why you have a weight problem (what's the root cause).\n\nNo amount of exercise will be successful for you until you learn to eat, right (and, if you're still eating Costco frozen section stuff and eating half your meals, out, forget it...there's no hope for you). Proper diet is essential for reversing insulin resistance (root cause) and until you learn how to deplete glycogen stores in your liver and start burning fat for energy, you'll re-gain the weight, back, guaranteed.\n\nAll exercise does is burn blood glucose. If you don't eat a proper diet, all you're doing is dumping more glucose from digested carbs back into the bloodstream. People with weight issues never learn how to burn fat. This is why they go round and round and re-gain, again and again.\n\nBut, I digress. Your exercise program is medieval if your experiencing pain. Exercise whatever you believe you must.

Soaking in hot water helps alleviate these symptoms but they go away on their own pretty quickly. half an hour to an hour. I thought it could be repetitive strain disorder considering i work construction and use my hands a lot but notice no correlation, if not complementary signs of hand pain and work performed. what i mean is the days where my hands receive the most trauma is not the most painful nights i have. I am a recovering addict with 3 years clean but i was a heavy intravenous user and i used to inject into my hands mostly. These symptoms are new, a few months maybe, and as i said i haven't used drugs in a long time. When i'm asleep like everyone else my heart rate is slower and if there is an obstruction due to drug use it would make sense for my hands to fall asleep but not cramp and unlikely to affect both hands equally. If it's muscle related why is it not worse when i'm, for example, operating a jack hammer all day which causes vibration trauma. Any ideas on what's going on would be great but most importantly what kind of doctor am i supposed to see about this?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"llunam","resp_time":"4 months ago","resp_title":"RE: hand cramping and pain.

I’m a 17 year male old drama student from Scotland. I have been suffering from chronic back and neck pain since my 4th year of high school. I am now in my first year of university. I am still suffering. The pain is intense. Each day when I wake up my neck feels so tight and I have to crack it really hard and also crack my back. Sometimes I feel a pulsating pain in my ears and my shoulders hurt too. I spent most of my day twisting my head around trying to relieve the pain but it doesn’t work, it just makes me look stupid and it is embarrassing. I have been told I have a slight bend in my spine, but not extreme scoliosis, just slightly. I have had physio therapy which hasn’t worked and have been taking useless pills for months to no avail (dihydrocodeine and etoricoxib). I have all the symptoms of spine arthritis / neck spondylitis but I am 17 (15 when it started so surely it can’t be that at this age?!) I have seen a chiropractor and have been told to go on a gluten free diet which I have tried (I have been off gluten for about 2 months) and I’ve had slight relief however the pain is still extreme! If I feel the back of my neck I can feel my upper vertebrae (below my head) moving and crunching as if it’s crumbling away like sandstone. I’m worried it’s really affecting my life. I’ve lost my job due to the pain. I am a fit person; I am an actor in training so I do a lot of exercise and also try yoga a lot. Absolutely nothing helps and it’s taking a toll mentally and physically and I really want some advice!

I had been experiencing lots of pain & fatigue along with swelling. When labs came back, some tests were high, but not high enough for him to start those meds. When I questioned this, he suggested I speak with his colleague. He did give me injections in my knees which is starting to wear off. Of course meeting with his colleague took months before I got an appointment. His colleague was very firm and told me if I had RA and lupus, they had gone away. He told me I was too old to still have lupus since I was over 50. What??? He said I didn't have RA any more because my sed rate was normal in that recent lab test, I only had osteoarthritis now. What???\n\nI never said I had lupus although I did have the symptoms. I had tests for RA and my previous rheumy confirmed it. He was just the wait and see type. Well we waited for years.

If you click on my user name you can read my full biography. I have been managing moderate to severe chronic pain since my late teens and now I am 60. So, over 40 years. I have severe osteoarthritis throughout my entire body. In 2015 I had both hips replaced - the right in June and the left in November - and that surgery was totally successful and I am thrilled with the results. My hips are the only places on my body with minimal to no pain.\n\nToday I can especially empathize as I am in terrible pain and have been for several weeks - even my left hip. We have had a very wet spring and summer here in Western New York. Wet weather and osteoarthritis do not play well together. I just took some enteric coated aspirin and a muscle relaxer. I am allergic to all prescription pain medications, so rely on what I just mentioned plus a great lift recliner, sleep number bed, monthly chiropractic adjustments (next Wed. 8/16 is my next appointment) but mostly my wonderful wife, sons, pets and above all my faith.\n\nNo question this hard. Pain is a pain, However, there are tools that help give us relief and deal with the pain. Have you tried joining a local \"Y\" or other fitness club that has a pool and/or hot tub? Water can be very soothing for joint pain. Are you taking any supplements? I have found that glucosamin helps, and am trying a new type of cinnamon capsules called Ceylon. Turmeric also has been reported to help with arthritis pain.\n\nWhat type of doctor(s) have you seen? Have you seen a rheumatologist and/or a pain management specialist? I have found the latter to be helpful but only short term. As already mentioned, I see my chiropractor once per month. That helps my back pain, but not the rest of my body like my hands.\n\nKeep doing your research. Keep moving as much as possible. Keep a positive attitude.\n\nI pray you find answers and relief soon.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave\n1\n"},{"author":"achyhands","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you Dave for your encouraging advice.

Since I react badly to NSAIDS, I had to look to natural supplements. What works for me is a combination of 4 different ones, which are all anti-inflammatories. They are: white willow bark (chemically similar to aspirin, but easier on the stomach), boswellia (resin from a shrub), ginger (I take it powdered in capsules), and MSM, a natural form of sulphur, which works well to ease arthritis pain. They are available in health food stores, but since I don't have a car, I order them online and have them mailed to me. I've tried using just one or two of them at a time, but my pain is better controlled using all four. The first three in the list do have slight blood-thinning properties, which you should know, in case your doctor wants you to take low-dose aspirin, as many of us seniors are advised to do. In my case, I told my doctor I would stay with my supplements, and would not take aspirin, as it upsets my stomach (and is known to cause g.i. system bleeding). You can research these supplements on your own, if you want. In my case, I was out of options; I cannot tolerate Ibuprofen and similar drugs; they cause me intense burning in my stomach. I hope this is helpful. This combination has made it possible for me (so far at least) to live with very bad knees (two years ago, I met with a surgeon who was ready to replace both of them). I said no, as I know people who've gone through that and had a terrible time (including my sister, who still walks stiffly, in pain, and uses a cane). I also have degenerative disc disease in my neck and lower back, with a history of three consecutive discs that herniated suddenly for no apparent reason, 9 years ago. I still have some pain, but also do stretches and exercises to manage it, and a chiropractor told me he doesn't even know how I'm able to walk around and manage as well as I do, given my various badly arthritic joints. I told him it's the combination of herbal anti-inflammatories I take; he was very surprised, and said he'd never heard that from any other patient! I guess the bottom line for me is, when traditional medicine fails us, or only has toxic drugs to offer ( such as the many people who are given prescriptions for harmful opiate drugs, for back pain, and then become addicted), that's when we patients need to educate ourselves, and take responsibility for our pain management, into our own hands.

It will only get worse. That doesn't mean it will happen fast, but it's a fact of aging. I have exactly the same problem as you - there is no cartilage left at the base of my thumb where it basically joins the wrist. I have bone spurs (sounds like you may have the same) which is bone-on-bone (no cushioning left from cartilage) on both hands. I can barely hold a pen any more. BUT the good news is, there is corrective surgery for this condition. I know my terminology isn't accurate, but they take part of a tendon (I think) out of your arm, and use that to wrap around the joint to create new cushioning. It's been done for many years and is highly successful. I'm thinking of having it done myself.\n\nRegarding your injections: did you get steroids or lidocaine? I get injections in both index fingers and both ring fingers every 3-4 months and that seems to help me. But it's a temporary solution.

I can't figure that out, but then again, he didn't seem to like answering too many questions.\nI have a friend who is older (like me) but I think her body is stronger. She had two knee replacements last year and did very well with both. I am pretty sure she waited 3 months between surgeries.\nOn the other hand, I have a friend who did not do well with surgery, I personally am very, very reluctant to do anything right now other than lose weight and take antioxidant supplements if possible.

The swelling and inflammation will decrease. You need to talk to your rheumatologist about going on another drug like Humira (which is a biologic) and most likely that would be taken along with Methotrexate. Both drugs target your RA differently. It takes up to 2 months to feel the effects of Humira and your rheumatologist will most likely slowly wean you off the steroid/prednisone over this time. The hardest part for me as well as others with RA is going through the process of finding the right drug. Also take Tylenol and use a combination of hot and cold to ease the inflammation. As hard as it is try to excercise every day. Try walking, yoga, Pilates, biking, tai chi, etc. I ordered “yoga jellies” online for my hands while doing yoga, I also use braces on my hands (like the kind you use when you have carpel tunnel syndrome) when using weights and other activities.

Expensive testing is done (Vectra disease activity scale) but I doubt anybody is really investigating the association between the findings and appropriate drugs to try. I was the one who suggested Actemra to my doc as I had high levels of interleukin -6.\n\nWhat was the most frustrating was that Docs need to follow guidelines set up by the Rheumatology Society that basically say what drugs (classes) are administered first. The insurance companies have more control. There is no jumping to the biologics first.\n\nI wasted 5 years of my life taking drugs that took 3-6 months to kick in - if they did - only to have to start all over when the drug failed or stopped working. Meanwhile, the disease is progressing. And with the progression came permanent damage.\n\nI was on oral steroids for 7 years ( I stopped it myself). It was supposed to take care of the inflammation but never did. I had steroid shots via ultrasound to my ankles, wrists, knees and elbows twice a year (the max insurance will pay for) and only two times did I get a temporary relief. Now I have serious permanent problems - osteopenia, borderline osteoporous, joint space narrowing (no cartilige between the joints), episcleritis, glaucoma, and synovitis in my ankles which is very painful. RA has attacked my tendons also - Achilles and post-tibial on both feet. I wore braces from the feet to my knees and they did nothing for me. I think they made me worse. Surgery is ot an option - no one will risk it.\n\nI also took pain killer for about a year - very potent painkillers which wore off after a few days and I was told to keep increasing my dose. I stopped them also. They weren't the answer.\n\nI can only walk about 80 feet indoors holding on to something. My wrists are shot so wheelchairs and walkers are a real challenge and usually create more problems. I am wheelchair bound outdoors. However, when I use a wheelchair pushed by another, it makes my condition worse because of the position I am in. The ankles and feet and tendons are killers.\n\nWhat advice to I have for you? Find a good, very experienced RA doc (word of mouth is better than online ratings). Seek out holistic approaches, acupuncture, yoga, diets, PRP injections, stem cell therapy, etc. These have worked for some people.\nAnd do research - I learned more from doing my own research than I did from the docs I was seeing. Also seek out university related clinical research programs.\n\nI have had one series of PRP injections (mini-stem cell treatments from your own blood) but interrupted them because of a home-related emergency that is taking my time up. I am also investigating stem cell treatment. Be careful. There are tricksters out there who will tell you that you need the cells from an unbilical cord or placenta but these won't work. Besides they never tell you that cross-matching is needed just like donating blood for compatibility. You need to use your own fatty stem cells from your abdomen.\n\nFor every institution I visited, I was told the same old, same old - that I'm in the one percentile and they don't know what to do with me. They also seemed to be more interested in administering drugs than thinking out of the box.\n\nIn my personal case I think that RA is much more complicated than admitted as not two people have the same symptoms, response to drugs or severity.\n\nPlease stay focused on this and stay firm with your docs. You life is wasting away and the disease is progressing. If you're not happy with one doc go to another. Time is of the essence.\n\nLife gets really lonely when you are as sick as I am. You're too debilitated to go out, people don't understand the disease and you get sick of defending your predicament.\n\nPlease try to stay as positive as possible because it is easy to sink into depression. I hope that it is only a matter of another drug that hasn't been tried but you need to push the docs who have your life in their hands. Being sick doesn't help.\n\nRemember that these drugs are nasty and can cause other problems. Get tested every three months for silent changes.\n\nWould you believe that I retired early at 50 so I could travel the world and the only travel I do is back and forth to docs and for tests. was hiking the Andes Mountains and Galapagos Islands 12 years ago.\n\nGood luck and if I think of anything else will send off to you.\n\nPraying you are one of the easier cases.\n"},{"author":"lillyg1978","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Suffering from dibilatating RA..","resp_content":"Try Orencia\n"},{"author":"fallingdowntoo","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Suffering from dibilatating RA..","resp_content":"Hi 1969wcj,\nWhen I was first diagnosed I started with oral MTX, which really made me sick to my stomach too.

At the moment I am in remission due to correct diagnosis and treatment. The initial diagnosis came from a dermatologist that already had 7 patients with this rare auto-immune. She took 2 skin biopsy's to confirm. She then also had me change to a specialist dermatologist that works directly with rhuematolgy.\nKeep in mind there are two forms of Dermatomyositis, one that presents more skin issues and one that presents more muscle issues. I presented with more skin issues but complained of joint arthritis that could not be explained by the Dermatomyositis. After further consulting and tests with the Rhuematologist it was determined I also have a type of RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) that came on at the same time as the Dermatomyositis.\nThe best advice I can give you is to seek out a skin biopsy so the diagnosis can be confirmed.

Now, it is considered \"out patient\". You must have your own person to stay with you and care for you at home. That person must go to pre-surgery class with you & provide you with all your care and transportation. Normally, due to pain medication--IF you can get it--means you cannot drive yourself for 2-3 weeks. Thanks to the opioid over users, now the hospitals here are saying they cannot even get it for the patients that need it..so check on that availability. Although they warn you that it takes 6 to 12 months to totally heal, they still expect you to do all the normal things you did before surgery plus Phys.Therepy a couple of times a week. Prepare to pay for that.\nWork? Plan on 4 weeks out, go back part time at first. This is a very serious surgery and your body needs to do a lot of healing over a fairly long period of time. However, by week 3, you should be feeling much better. Just remember, your body is still healing even tho you feel better.\n"},{"author":"nmadev","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Hip Labral Tear","resp_content":"How did your surgery go?

I am sorry this is so long. I've been pursuing a diagnosis for a longtime but haven't been given anything definite yet. I have seen a rheumatologist for the first time. He gave me several prescriptions and lab orders for blood work and x-rays and I was to return for the results in two weeks. But while at the pharmacy trying to get the prescriptions filled I found out that my insurance had dropped me. This put a hold on it all for almost 2 months while I had to get all of that straightened out. I was able to get my insurance reinstated finally. I've now had all of the tests that the doctor ordered completed and I go back June 5th to see the doctor to find out the results. But at this point I am so sick and my skin is so bad that I am scared that time may not be on my side right now. The joint pain has completely disabled me. The issues that are happening with my skin are disfiguring me. There are several issues that I think may be contributing factors. I think I may have a connective tissue auto immune disorder. But I also have a history of severe constipation. I am talking really really bad. I often get impacted. I've became really sick over this several times. I've read how the poisons that can get backed up into your system from this can cause all kinds of skin conditions. I also have a habit of compulsive skin picking. I do pick until I make sores but these sores are sorta self inflicted. The problem originates from the chemical response in my brain that stimulates my reaction to pick until I make a sore. But I've got a lot of scarring from it and I am wondering if what's going on now could be a reaction to the damage that's been done to my skin tissue from the picking. It can be common to develop calcium deposits inside of damaged scar tissue. The only other thing that I can think of that could possibly be a contributing factor is the stress I've experienced. I've went through some extremely traumatic events. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Is it possible that this could have triggered a response from my immune system??\n\nThe mornings are the worst. It takes me about an hour and a half before I am able to function after I've woke up. My hands and feet are always swollen. I am always stiff as a board all over. In order to just be able to move it's like I have to break every single joint out of a frozen state. But this happens anytime I am sitting still for a long period of time. My neck gets really bad. Sometimes I wish I had arm slings to free my shoulder sockets from the weight of my arms. I also have had issues with my throat. By the end of the day I started losing my voice. But then my eyes started getting so dry that for the first time in my life I bought eye drops. After this started happening I went to the doctor. We didn't focus as much on how my joints were doing cause the doctor was more concerned with my throat because there was swelling. An ultrasound showed nodules on my thyroids. I had tests done where they stick a needle in the nodules and draw fluid out. The doctor wanted to eliminate cancer. It was benign. But I do have several nodules on my thyroids. This may be causing some of this because your thyroids affect so many things. But I am also aware that dry throat and eyes are symptoms of connective tissue diseases also. I have extreme fatigue. By 3pm everyday my day is over with regardless.\n\nBut out of everything it is my skin thats the worst. I have noticed that my sweat has became different. At certain times it's like I sweat a lot more and it's stickier. I've also noticed a weird smell. It smells like peroxide. That may sound crazy but it's true. But this seems to happen right before my skin goes through the phases that it does. The texture becomes different like plastic. It seems like thicker pads of skin have developed over my elbows, finger joints and knee caps. Sometimes the sores will appear exactly like little paper cuts. It literally looks like perfectly straight little cuts. At first I did pick at them until I got so overwhelmed with fear because of the whole ordeal. When I did if I squeezed them its like they opened up to little wart like sores inside. But what's so weird is that they usually appear in groups of three and develop into 3 perfect circle sores. Then they become like embedded rocks in my skin. I think it is calcium deposits. The skin gets really hard and red all around the area. It becomes really tender. I have these places all over me. When its all inflamed its the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. I literally feel like a raw exposed nerve that's been rolled into broken pieces of glass all over. I am wondering if it's doing this inside of me also. When I look into what kind of sores these could be everything refers to calcium. I did have kidney stones years ago really bad. The stones were sent off and came back as calcium oxalate. They ran tests on my kidneys and determined that I had a condition with calcium in my kidneys. Could all of this just be the result of how my body handles calcium? I don't know what to do. I am trying to figure out what I can do to at least prevent as much damage as possible.

Actually Lupus is what my primary care doctor is thinking it is. I guess I am still in some state of denial thinking that if I don't say these words then it can not be any of them. But I know that something really serious is going on that is going to change my life forever. I wish I could upload pics of these sores. They are so specific. What gets me is that they always come up in a row of three circles. There's always three. I know that has to be specifically in relation to something. Honestly after all of the studying I have done I am the most scared that it's MCTD which is mixed connective tissue disease. It's an overlapping of 4 auto immune diseases. Lupus, RA and scleraderma. Tbh at this point I would almost be relieved to find out that it was just Lupus. I am most scared of scleraderma and that's what my symptoms seem to be most consistent with. I can not find out much about what Lupus can do to the skin. I know it can affect people differently. But what I seen is more like rashes and then the reference to the butterfly on the face. These are deep holes with like embedded rocks that I am thinking is calcium. Afterwards it leaves a big hole. The texture of my skin changes and there's a smell like peroxide that comes out of me. I knew I had some issue with calcium because of all the kidney stones that I have had and some x ray tests I had done years ago diagnosed me with\nnephrocalcinosis which is calcium in the kidneys. From what I understand this is from where I do not get enough calcium so my body pulls it from my bones. This itself could cause breakdown of my bones leading to some of this pain. When this all really set in I started losing my voice by the end of everyday. I noticed that right before a bad spell my throat, mouth and eyes get really dry. They get so dry that I had to buy eyes drops for the first time in my life. The first test they ran was an ultrasound of my throat. I do have several big nodules on my thyroids. This could be causing some of this cause your thyroids affect so many things.

DDD affects the discs in the spine causing them to degenerate, while Osteoporosis affect the bones in our bodies causing them to be weak and brittle. I have advanced DDD with 2 or 3 discs actually fully gone, but I do not have Osteoporisis. I have had a few Dexa scans over the years and my bones are fine.\n\nAlso you have no discs in your hips.

RA is a progressive disease that can damage the joints, tendons, and bones and affect the whole body, including vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and eyes.\n\nThe most prominent tip-off to RA is the presence of persistent swelling in multiple joints that doesn’t occur in other types of joint pain. Other classic symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint pain that gets worse in the morning and gets better with movement, the presence of lumps or rheumatoid nodules below the skin and persistent fatigue. While some uncommon symptoms include fever, weight loss, anemia, and depression.\n\nHow to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis?\n\nThe rheumatologist will check your symptoms, medical history and will examine you accordingly. You may be asked for a blood test to be done. If the blood test reports show the presence of 60 to 70% of rheumatoid factor (an abnormal antibody, a protein that attacks healthy tissues), then there is 80% chance of you getting RA or other inflammatory diseases.\n\nOther blood indicators that may indicate the presence and level of inflammation in the body, include:\n\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha\nC-reactive protein (CRP) levels\n\nHope this Helps you\n"},{"author":"gr8shpr","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you, varshanaidu!","resp_content":"The swelling I had could only be described as looking like contusions.\nI imagine my MD will continue to check the RA factor.

Multiple possibly permanent complications from thumb injury","post_content":"Hey guys, this could qualify as a short story but I need answers so please bear with me.\n\nSo, this injury happened on the night of a local Carols event in late November. Most of the younger population of my town go out in groups and get drunk for the Carols, see where the night takes them and whatnot, and naturally I was with them. I definitely didn't get the worst, a mate fell on his own Jack's bottle he threw on the ground and split his hand open quite badly. Later that night, I was at a friends house with a couple other mates. We decided it would be a good idea to play punchies (One for one arm punches). On my second hit, something else caught my eye as I swung and I basically stabbed his shoulder with my thumb at full power. Also, when I connected, instead of my thumb bending back like it should've, it stayed straight and drove into his shoulder like a lance. About 20 minutes later it was thrice the size, and all the little creases in your skin around the joints seemed like they were bleeding under the skin. By the next day it had lessened in swelling quite a bit and I had slight range of motion with my thumb. The next day, I had gained some more range of motion, although not much, and the swelling had mostly gone down, although it was still noticeably larger than my left thumb. I saw my GP and she said that I might have soft tissue damage in the joint at the base of the distal phalanx, and to get it X-Ray'd. I did that later that day, and they did find a fracture at the top of the proximal phalanx. The GP called me when she got her copy of the X-Ray, and said that I should see a specialist that she'd referred me to. I couldn't see that specialist because I had no money, and I was supposed to go the next day to a Medical clinic a significant distance away from me. I don't have a car to get there, and even a consultation with any specialist is more than I can afford, so I'm just dealing with it. However, what's worrying me is the way my thumb acts now. In the enclosed picture, you can see three tags on key areas:\n\n1: The actual fracture. My thumb is no longer producing the same kind of pain as the initial weeks of recovery, so I believe this is actually healing fine.\n\n2: This joint is the most worrying to me. I can no longer place a good amount of pressure with that thumb, and examples are the best way for me to describe this:\n-If I squeeze something (i.e. a cup, or a pen because I have a habit of squeezing my pen really hard when I write) hard it hurts sharply enough for me to jerk my hand back and possibly drop whatever I'm holding.\n-If I unscrew a lid, or something that requires constant pressure, I don't notice anything until I attempt to bend my thumb back, at which point it painfully clicks back into place.\n\n3: This one is pretty hard to explain, even to someone in person. You know how the base bone in your thumb sorts of stays where it is when you independently bend your thumb back? Well when I bend my thumb back, the base bone moves inwards opposite the rest of my thumb. It could resemble what happens when you use a crowbar to lever something. The bone below #3 is the object being lifted, and my thumb above #3 is the crowbar lifting it. Make any sort of sense? I can also feel but *not* hear a click in the base joint when my thumb is bent fully back.\n\nSorry again that this is so damn long, but the details are necessary to fully understand what happened. I am particularly concerned about this being permanent because it somewhat affects my ability to play guitar, and this is the last thing I need when I'm about to start my new job and start properly working with my band. Not to mention I'm only 19 so I don't really want to be living the rest of my life with a dominant hand that doesn't work properly.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: wasn't sure where I should've posted this so I just stuck it in Arthritis.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/38445/help-multiple-possibly-permanent-complications-from-thumb-injury"},{"post":{"author":"badger101","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Total knee replacement","post_content":"I had a total knee replacement 1 1/2 years ago.

His life quality has gradually diminished with him not being able to walk unassisted anymore and being in a generally bad mental shape. We are thinking of having a baby soon but my father-in-law is worried that he will not be able to see his grandchildren anymore. My husband is an only child and the situation is breaking my heart.\n\nWe live in Milan, Italy and he didn't get as much sun as he used to and didn't enjoy life as much in the last few years. He had a surgery on the aorta 5-6 years ago and was a heavy smoker (1 pack a day) until 10 years ago. No other health conditions, balanced diet as my mother-in-law is taking care of his diet. He has even recently had a laser eye surgery and feeling perfectly ever since. So, he's pretty resilient.\n\nHe saw an Orthopedic doctor roughly 2 years ago and they told him that surgery would be very dangerous with total anesthesia because of the lungs. Then we saw another doctor that said the same thing. We lost faith and decided that it is perhaps safer to continue to live with the pain, which was then occasional. Except that the pain has got worse in the last couple of months and he is now unable to walk unassisted or sit down on a sofa.\n\nLately, I've been reading all these posts about elders in their 80s or even 90s who are having hip replacement surgeries in late age and everything is going well after for at least half a dozen more years.\n\nI would be immensely grateful to anyone who can help with specialist advice that we would be willing to follow. We may even consider having a foreign doctor with a track record of surgeries for seniors with similar cases.\n\nPlease help.\n\nThank you in advance.","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Osteoarthritis","Hip Replacement"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/33750/85-year-old-with-hip-pain-wants-to-live-normally-and-needs-surgery"},{"post":{"author":"sina71197","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"20 year old months of joint pain","post_content":"Hello, \nThis is the first time using this forum so i am still trying to figure it out. I am a 20 year old student who was an active weight lifter. I have not been able to lift for approximatly 6 months now due to knee and elbow pain on both my knees and both my elbows. My knee issues started roughly 1.5 years before i stopped lifting. They would hurt 1-3 days after leg days depending on how hard I worked out but would always go away. My elbows started hurting only about 2 months before i stopped lifting. My right one started bugging me and soon my left began as well a couple days later. I continued lifting for 2 months until i decided it was not leaving so I stopping in hopes of it leaving in 1-2 months. Its now been 6 months and not only have my elbows not healed but my knees are still hurting as well even though the pain would go away after workouts in the past. I have seen many different doctors. My sports medicine doctor even ordered mri’s on all 4 joints and found that there is very slight tendonitus and muscle strains on my elbows but found nothing on my knees. Both my elbows and knees get slightly irritated when rubbing against clothing. My elbows mostly hurt on the back side where the tricep connects to the elbow. It usually begins to get more irritated once i type a lot, write a lot, or pick things up. It goes away right after I stop doing that activity but lingers. My knees hurt all over and usually hurt if i stand too long or try to do light excersizes like body weight squat holds. I have been going to the physical therapist for my knee pain and have been doing the excersizes they give me but seem to be of little help and sometimes even makes them ach afterwards. Stretching and cycling on a stationary bike seem to help along with hot showers. I have gone to a chiropractor and occupational theropist for my elbows. I am currently going to a DO doctor who does massage therapy on my elbows. Nothing seems to be helping with healing. I have seen no change after the second month of rest. No doctor has been able to tell me why it is that I have not healed. I am beginning to wonder if it is some some of arthritis. I am wondering if i should go see a rheumatologist at this point. I am confused on why both my knees and elbows are in this situation at once. I limit lots of movements now and can not do the things that I like. Any workout on my legs that need me to bend my knees even a little makes then hurt a couple hours after. My elbows as well. This is also just with light weight when I was testing out to see if im doing any better. I have been taking vitamins and minerals, glucosamine, tumeric and many others. I took naproxin for 1 month in the beginning 1000 mg a day and saw only slight change. I have not gotten any cortizone injections yet and am still going to physical therapy for my knees and to massage therapy for my elbows. Perhaps i should go to an acupuncturist to see if that will help. Any adive would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.","like_count":"0","tags":["Osteoarthritis","RA","Symptoms","Treatment"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/33166/20-year-old-months-of-joint-pain"},{"post":{"author":"britdanielle94","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Not really sure wear to put this","post_content":"My arms (where it bends) keep cramping up a lot today and it feels like a charley horse.

Does anyone here have this?","resp_content":"Hi,\n\nI'm the Chief Medical Director for WebMD and a physician and I have ankylosing spondylitis. I started having symptoms when I was around 19, which is fairly typical. If your symptoms have developed in the last several years (with no such symptoms in early adulthood), the likelihood of you having ankylosing spondylitis is much less. However, if you did have symptoms that just never got diagnosed as a particular condition, that's pretty common with AS. Back pain is so common that many docs miss that AS is a possibility among all the other possible causes. So if you think you may be dealing with AS, then a rheumatologist is certainly your best bet. Even if it doesn't turn out to be AS, I would agree that 65 is way too young to not be able to walk. Stenosis can definitely cause symptoms like you suggest. But if that's what it is, why haven't you had a more definitive treatment to deal with the pain. At this point the pain seems to be so severely limiting your ability to live your life, that more aggressive treatment seems to be in order. Of course I'm not your physician and can't determine what's best for you.

An orthopedist would be able to investigate and also determine if it seems there is something going on that a different type of doctor should look at.

You can cut them up bc the Lidocaine is infused with the glue that holds them on. I cut them in half and put half directly on the spine. I think that works well even though the docs don't think putting them over the spine is better than near the spine.\nMost of my pain is in my upper legs. So I also put a patch over each thigh muscle. It does help. Without the patch I can only walk a few hundred feet and then I have to sit at least 1 minute. With the patch on I can walk twice that distance before sitting. I'm lucky that pain isn't my big issue. My big problem is not being able to walk far or stand long. I'm also bent forward and can't straighten up. I need a new MRI done. In 2010 I had 2 degenerating discs.\nI also have damage in the cervical spine called Demyelinating plaque. Usually this is from MS but they said I don't have MS. They call it Demyelinating Disease. It effects my right arm. I can barely hold a pen.\nAs bad as that is the problems in the lumber spine are what's crippling me. It has gotten much worse in the past 5 yrs.

So to start off I have Ehrlos Danlos type 3. I went in for surgery Aug 31 2017. They inserted a big hard IV in my hand and instantly I had pain asked him to remove it and put it in my left hand pls. I have had a total of 5 iv's in my hands over the years and not one caused me pain. His response was \" it's in your hand it will hurt\" and he walked away. So I go in for surgery mentioning how much it hurts my hand and just get brushed off. Wake up a few hours later and ask the nurse first thing \"please take out this IV it hurts alot\". Her response \"no sorry it's im your hand it will hurt\". Now I have pain meds at this point and still feel this pain and can't bend my hand at all due to how hard this thing is. So i go to my room and I ask the new nurse \"please take out my IV it really hurts and is tingling at thia point and my pinky and ring finger are knumb\". She responds with \"sorry sweety we can not remove it until thw doc signs you out to leave\". Now not one person even looked at my hand to see if it was swollen or anything. I was finally released by 1pm so the IV was in from 7am to 1pm (not a long time). My hand swelled up and got me nervous but I was on better pain meds so I pretty much slept a week (gloriously)! Following week back at work my hand swelled within an hr of computer use. I waited a week called my Doc and told them whats up because now I could also see a brown line tracing where the iv was and my fingers were still knumb amd cold. They recommended hot water and stretch. So 2 weeks went by and even after 500mg advil and the exercises the hand still hurts amd is now mostly my whole hand and running down my wrist so off to the ortho. 7weeks pre-op I see an ortho finally, they say here take 500mg aleve and exercise stay away from heat, and they xrayed and said you prob have tendonitous in your finger now. I say the pain is in my hand and the focus on my wrist. Also by this time my pointer finger has become very painful and stiff to move and swollen to double its normal size. They say come back in 6 weeks which was yesturday! The Dr. Never looked at my hand I have been doing the exercises and taken both the aleve and advil (advil at night fot swelling aleve during the day to help mobility). He just said keep exercising you can not screw it up. Here is were I am at, 10weeks post-op swollen hand (knuckles have no definiton), pointer finger double its size and hard to move, still feeling the achey pain and brown mark under my skin. As I mentioned I have EDS and am thinking they are just brushing it off as pain from that BUT the kicker I have had absolutly no pain at all in my hands since I stopped playing aports at 18 I am now 35!

Throughout my life my health has been fair, rarely got sick, except a few crazy things that are not explainable. It all started at age 20 in 2010 when I was rushed to the hospital with meningitis. After recovery no issues for a few years, then in 2012 I was back in the hospital due to a severe infection in one of the lymph nodes, located in the back of my neck (only seen in small children). After recovery just like before no issues for a few more years, then in 2015 I tripped and fell (not a big fall at all) but suffered severe bruising, and could barley walk, it turned out that I had a full tear of my gracilis tendon (not common, except in major athletes) and almost a full tear of my hamstring. The recovery went great, I was determined to get off crutches and recovered after 4 months. Then 3 months later I got sick, which turned into a really bad sinus infection, and bronchitis. From there it went downhill, first my left wrist suddenly became swollen. Went into my orthopedic surgeon and he did an injection which helped tremendously. I then started to have pain that following month in my abdomen, that couldn't be explained on imaging. So my OBGYN and a General Surgeon put me under. They ended up removing my appendix, and I also had a bad case of endometriosis causing them to remove my tubes as well. Pathology reported I had chronic inflammation of my appendix, but a month later they removed my gallbladder as well, which as well appeared to have chronic inflammation and a polyp. Since then I have suffered from inflammation all over, was finally referred to my Rheumatologist July of last year. They did an ultrasound of my hands and feet, which showed inflammation of the synovial fluid and that I had erosion. Also I have photophobia and really bad dry mouth so they did an ultrasound of my salivary glands and said I have secondary Sjrogens disease.\nTests done that were normal range\nRA factor, Ana, ESR, CRP\nTests done that were abnormal\nCBC - MCHC always high, MPV always low\nCMP - Bun, Creatinine, AST were low every time\nC3 should be between 80-180/C4 should be between 10-40 My results were C3 - 38 and C4 - 11\nThey have tried plaquinel, methotrexate, and then pulling me off all meds.

I have asked questions as to how they came up with the diagnosis of seronegative ra and what other diseases mimic the disease including how lupus has been ruled out, and yet have only got the run around. How do I trust, and know they are pumping the right medications into me when they wont answer the basic questions/concerns I have? Im lost, and afraid, and fear the doctors office anymore.

The chair shifted slightly underneath me, causing me to lose my balance and my hand, with the weights in its grip and mid-air, to go behind my shoulder. It was painful. So basically MRIs revealed a posteroinferior labral tear, along with a chondral defect in the glenoid and an osteochondral lesion (yes I know what this means. I'm not rattling off the report LOL). I sat on it for a while, as per the doc's advice, doing the recommended physio. It didn't help. So I got an arthroscopic surgery done on my shoulder to fix it. During the surgery, it was found that the region between the tear and the defect on the glenoid was loose and not attached to the socket of my shoulder. That loose segment of the glenoid was cut out and the labrum was stretched over to cover that removed segment. Also, micro-fracturing was done. Now the doctor's visit during the post-op recovery leads me to my problem. During this visit, he tells me that weightlifting and all to a certain light extent is fine after around four months and for the rest of my life (when I say light, I'm speaking in my terms, e.g. a bicep curl of 50kg or a deadlift of 120kg etc) but bodyweight exercise should be severely restricted unless I want a high likelihood of early-onset arthritis. The same goes for me exceeding the weightlifting parameters I just mentioned. I'm not trying to sound impossible here or seem like I'm throwing a tantrum, being of the young age that I am, but weightlifting and other sorts of fitness, in general, are crucial to me. I can live a life without them, but not a content one. On the other hand, the huge threat of early-onset arthritis is not a pleasant thought.\n\nI was hoping someone here would have suggestions for me.\n\nP.S.\n1) Please do not suggest running, that is my base level of fitness, I could do that on my deathbed.\n2) I am not trying to go against my doctor's wishes or such.\n3) This is not a request for encouragement or a cry for attention. I am very focused towards my recovery, and nothing will stop me from returning to the world of fitness with full force, but I need to approach that return with extreme caution.\n\nKind regards, and thanks in advance.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/arthritis/28844/arthritis-in-my-future"},{"post":{"author":"evosera","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Which doctor(s) can diagnose skeletal fluorosis?","post_content":"Hello,\n\nI have been trying to find someone who can see if the strange full-body joint and lower back pain I have had since high school is skeletal fluorosis.

I saw a rheumatologist (doctor was in the room for MAYBE 50 seconds, no joke) and after saying my x rays were normal they looked at my thumbs and said \"thumbs of an 80 year old, Osteoarthritis\" and then left. I'm getting very scared this is going to be permanent and though they said my x-ray was \"normal\" so they refuse any further imagining like an MRI... even though I can't move my fingers, they constantly hurt and are extremely stiff, and the index and middle fingers (sometimes thumb too) lock up any time they are extended or if I put my hand flat, and then they start this clicking from the joint/twitching kind of spasm that feels awful. Seems to be from the PIP joint.

Thanks again!\nReply\ndavedsel2\nover 2 years ago\nCEYLON is a specific type of cinnamon. The brand I bought from Amazon.com is Cellium Professional Nutrition. $10.00 for 60 pills, which is a 30 day supply. Just brought out the bottle - each pill contain 600 mg, and the recommendation is 2 pills totaling 1,200 mg per day. It is supposed to be as effective as 6,000 mg of the other type of cinnamon. It is helping my blood glucose levels, but not my chronic pain. The weather in our area has been very wet since March. If it is not raining the humidity is high. I think, though, if I was not taking the glucosamine my pain levels would probably be even higher.\nReply\nrabbit4949\nover 2 years ago\nDave, I'm glad you told me the brand because I was checking on Amazon for Ceylon cinnamon that had 2000 mg/tab. I did find a brand that potent but from your last post, taking Cellium brand is more concentrated and a person only needs 1200 mg instead. And I thought the cinnamon was helping with your pain but it's the glucosamine that's helping with that. So, once again, you've clarified for me which I appreciate. Getting first hand recommendations and reviews of products is why I got on this board. It paid off for me.

Also be careful of sneaky calories in drinks.\n\nSigning up for something like Weight Watchers might be a good idea. That's what really helped me jump start my weight loss. It helps you get a feel for what kinds of foods and how much of them you should be having to really see weight loss.\n\nAlso, add some low-impact exercises into your routine.

I had a similar experience in 2015 only with my hips. Due to severe osteoarthritis both needed replacing. I chose an orthopedic surgeon who agreed to to the surgery but encouraged me to lose weight. My BMI was about 40. I went to several pre-op visits with him, had all the pre-op work done at the hospital, and 2 days before my scheduled surgery he changed his mind and decided it was too risky.\n\nMy primary doctor suggested I consider weight loss surgery and began the process of preparing for a gastric sleeve. Then I decided to get the opinion of a different orthopedic surgeon. He said I needed the hips replaced asap, and went ahead and did my right hip in June of 2015 and my left in November of 2015. Both surgeries were totally successful and I am thrilled with the results. I realized I needed to lose weight to make the new hips last, so by the end of 2015 did get my BMI down to 37 by eating less and being more active - no weight loss surgery.\n\nWeight loss surgery of any kind is only a tool. You still need to make a lifestyle change. It may be different for knees, but you may think about doing what I did and getting the opinion of a different orthopedic surgeon. Continue to make efforts to improve your health, but see if there is a doctor that can help you now.\n\nI pray you find the answers and relief you need soon.\n"},{"author":"sia69","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank You for your response.

And unfortunately we don't typically know where they come from. They often just come out of the blue. There's no evidence that certain medications can cause allergies to occur to other substances.

I was doing some research to see if there is an ingredient in Blistex that might be in gloves but I wasn't able to pinpoint anything in my short research. Do they have any ideas about what in the blue gloves you might be allergic to?

My symptoms are the same as yours but you have them more severely than me - though mine are pretty disabling. I felt I must have something else wrong such as a nerve issue in the back, but your post indicates that maybe I just have very severe osteoarthritis like you do. No one has told me that I may end up in a wheel chair (or paralysed) but I have said this to some doctors. I am only able to walk 100 yards/metres without sitting down. I cannot clean my house or mow the lawn. I use a four wheeled walker in shopping centres as this allows me to take my weight off my back and legs to some extent. My balance has been affected. My muscles have not deteriorated much as yet.\n\nAsk your doctor to check you for a rare complaint called STIFF PERSON SYNDROME - you can look it up on Wikipedia.\n\nI try to exercise by walking in a 25 metre indoor pool - you have got to keep moving, though this does not cure the problem. Also I cycle on an exercise bike. At the indoor shopping centres I use my walker to walk about 1000 metres , a few floors - but I need to rest even with the walker at intervals. I do not always do all of these things in a week and I generally I feel I should be exercising more, though at times I need to force myself to do so.\n\nI take a slow acting Naprosyn which \"seems\" to help somewhat.

Have a look on YOUTUBE. Keep going doctors until you get a good one. In USA this may be difficult because of your health insurance plan or no plan. In my case the doctors are ok but many do not go that extra mile. And a significant number of doctors unfortunately are not greatly interested in older people.\n\nI am not falling over though my muscles are stiff and sore and tendons tight. I suppose they have tested you for ear/balance issues. I would suggest a walker - there are all different types. Look on the web first before you buy. I did not want a walker even though I am not young. A walking stick does not suit my problem. My walker has a seat and four wheels. I use it in supermarkets because I have to sit down fairly regularly.\n\nInvestigate STIFF PERSON SYNDROME, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA and VERTIGO - these have probably been investigated by your doctors and yourself but I mention them just in case they have not been.\n\nDespite what most researchers in this field say, for most people a special diet does not seem to help. But my view is that a particular diet may help a particular individual - research dealing with a sample of 1000 patients does not pick up on an effective diet for an individual person. But this is a very difficult issue to solve if it can be solved.\n\nDr Mercola (Newsletter from USA) has come in for criticism but I would subscribe to his newsletter as his articles are well written and he interviews some important experts. Just judge as best you can for yourself. (I do not agree with anyone fully on anything.) You have got to be the boss of your health now that you have a complicated problem that most doctors cannot help you with in any significant way.\n\nI am concerned about you falling as this does not seem to be only due to arthritis - but there are over 100 different variations of arthritis.

According to Ayurveda, osteoarthritis occurs because of an aggravation of vata-dosha. Vata is the body's bio-energy, which represents the air or wind and manages all movements in the body. Arthritis condition occurs when Vata-dosha is increased actively in the joints. Because Vata-dosha is dry by nature, it absorbs the liquid from any part of the body. That is what causes the destruction of cartilage and reduce the amount of synovial fluid within the joint capsule.\nAyurvedic treatment of osteoarthritis, not only prevent further deterioration in the joints, but also rejuvenates the damaged cartilage. Mitigating, using special herbs, Vata Dosha treatments are also recommended for the lubrication and strengthening of joints.

Nearly a year later, she has no symptoms. This is her story:\n\nIn March of 2016 she woke up with a very swollen knee, warm to touch, and couldn't walk on it. Our pediatrician immediately indicated it might be arthritis, as more and more children are developing it. After a normal X-ray and blood work (rheumatoid factor: normal), our pediatrician sent us to a rheumatologist, who watched it for 2 months.\n\nEmotionally, our daughter had aways been VERY attached to mom, but she went into a state where she would not leave my side (literally, I could not go to the store, doctor's appointments) for months without her being hysterical.\n\nAfter no improvement, our daughter began 10 ml/ day of Naproxen for 5 months. Due to inflammation and fluid, her knee wouldn't go straight. We took her to physical therapy twice a week and did chiropractic work.\n\nAfter allergy, blood, and stool testing our pediatrician determined that our daughter had many allergies: pollen, food (dairy and egg whites), and minor hypoglycemia. Our pediatrician attributes our daughter's JRA with Leaky Gut which more doctors are looking at the correlation to autoimmune and inflammatory issues. Our pediatrician (an MD) also uses integrative medicine like a nutritionist on staff and herbal remedies.\n\nWe were diligent about removing allergens (egg whites, dairy, pine nuts, sesame seeds) from our daughter's diet. We increased omega supplements, digestive enzymes, and probiotics.\n\nOur daughter improved through June, July, August and got slightly worse again in September, October. We reduced medicine to 5 ml/day. She improved and got more emotionally independent (less clingy to me) in Nov/Dec. Any kind of high impact activities (trampoline, gymnastics, etc.) would aggravate pain.\n\nIn January our rheumatologist took our daughter off medicine but continued PT. Our Dr. predicted our daughter's knee would swell up and she would need to undergo steroid shot under sedation.\n\nUnexpectedly, our daughter did better. An ultrasound with rheumatologist 6 weeks later determined only minor fluid still in the knee (which would not justify the cortisone shot).\n\nOur daughter continued to improve with no medication, and she still has no pain, no swelling, and no warmth. It has been 5 months. Our rheumatologist does not believe in leaky gut nor does she believe in a significant correlation between diet and allergies. We do, based on what we have seen with our daughter's improvement.\n\nWe have no know family history of JRA but my husband has ulcerative colitis (auto-immune) and many food allergies, asthma.\n\nThere is not a day that goes by where I don't watch my daughter's walk (looking for a slight limp) or feel her knee for warmth and swelling in the mornings (typical of JRA). Whatever worked, we are beyond grateful. I know each case is different but feel free to reply if anyone needs more info.

Sleeping is a luxury, because it is so hard to get into a position that's comfortable. Both hips hurt & I fractured my left pelvis a couple of years ago so sleeping on the left side is out. I get 3 hours of sleep at a time, and cannot nap during the day. Doctors have changed so much. We had one that we loved for 10 years and then he retired. My small town doesn't offer much in good doctors so you get what you get. Pain Management is 120 miles away & my husband drives & he is 67 & has RA, and I am 62 & had a Local Doc here for 8 months who made fun of the way I walked, took one of mt Metoporol ( Heart Med) away to accommodate his Oxycoyin 20mg twice a day, made my heart skip. I had a heart attack in 2014 so hated that, and he also had me on 3/10mg of NORCO. I stopped his Oxycotin and just took the 3 NORCO, we didn't get along at all. I found another doctor in the meantime. When he found out I stopped his Oxycotin and ONLY took the 3-10mg of NORCO, he said he wouldn't treat my pain. I made up my mind that he wasn't going to FORCE ME TO TAKE ANY TYPE OF PAIN MED THAT I DIDNT LIKE, AND STOP ONE OF MY HEART MED. My heart doc was furious! I turned him into the State after looking him up online he had been suspended several times for Drug Abuse! The State told me what to do. But this Doc wrote me up for \"Abusing pain MEDS\", which was impossible because they print out your script & call you every month to pick it up! And I never even called to have the Oxy filled that last month! I \"Under-Abused his drugs\", and now I gave this in my file. Just found that out a couple of weeks from Pain Management that we drive to every month, 250 mile round trip. We are both so stove up when we get home from the drive, we hardly feel like eating. What is Wrong with these Doctors? My town doesn't have a Pain Management October. That doc who gave me Oxy is just a regular Family Physician. I disliked him the first day, then it just got worse. I like the New lady Doc I see & I like my Oncologist who does my blood work every 3 months, have seen her for 4 yrs & we get along fine. She also referred me to Pain management, they had a small office here in my town & were going to expand here, but that never happened. So the long 250 mile trip is not worth it, but the Norco really helps. Not constantly, but takes the edge off. My osteoarthritis pain is so bad I walk bent over at the waist & Use a 4-wheeled Walker to walk upright, because my spinal chord protrudes terribly, and my neck is always down so looking up isn't easy to do. It's miserable. I sympathize with you. My husband doesn't support me at all either and has Road Rage all the way for 250 Mike's & Keeps me a nervous wreck by the time I get Their and then on the way home. I miss our old Doc that retired. We had my MEDS adjusted perfectly, now starting out all over I keep getting them adjusted again. I just wish I could be on my old regime that finally worked! But the CDC is coming down so hard on benzopeines, Diazepam helped my neck better than anything, and is the best muscle relaxer out there.

I have had 8 surgeries in total in the last 10 years; including Arthroscopies (to fix tears), Osteotomies on both hips, a right hip replacement in Dec2015 and a left hip replacement 3 weeks ago. Just repairing the cartilage isn't solving the issue, so it will happen again and probably a lot sooner than 5 years (at 6 months I was in the same boat again). There is no way to tell how long the cortisone shots will keep you pain free... to quote my consultant \"...could be 6 days, 6 weeks or 6 months\". I actually got 13 days.\nMy Osteotomies didn't work. There was already too much damage and the damage continued after the Osteotomies.\nI left it far too long to take action, thinking unless I'm really suffering then what's the point of putting myself through it. In hindsight, it was going to happen regardless. I should've taken action asap meaning less meds (with their own side affects!) and less muscle atrophy.\nI have had to fight quite a lot to get the hip replacements... and i am out of pain for the first time in 15 years.\n\nUltimately, only you can make the decision about any surgery. But if I could choose again... delaying isn't the best choice. It's about quality of life. How much pain are you in? How much damage is there to your joint? Is it arthritic? (And question for your doctor). Hip replacement may seem like a huge surgery, but these days it really isn't. I was 2 nights in hospital, they got me up out of bed 4 hours after surgery too. The Osteotomies were a far worse experience, however everyone is different and also I believe the surgery has progressed and is less invasive since I had it done.\n\nIf you want more info, there are websites, forums and support groups available for Hip Dysplasia .

There are at least two ways to do a hip replacement and obviously I selected the long and more painful of the two. One is much less invasive and the soft tissue is not tramautized as much and the healing takes place much faster. It was explained to me that they rotate your body and do not have to cut through muscle tissue and then reattach it after cutting the femor bone and installing the ball and then the cup. I wish you good luck in finding a Dr. that uses this procedure. I live in a city with over a million population and there is only 1 Dr here that does it that way. The recovery time is much much shorter with this less invasive procedure. Such is life. We all live and learn. The truth is that even with rehab the time frame for the for the invasive surgery is 8-12 months normal recovery time.

Brian McGrory, MD informed me at my consult that he could be the best hip surgeon in the world but he could never make me 100% (I hadn't been since birth.) and that I also had to be the best patient in the world.

I just had the first stage completed. With my history, 8/2014 had my right knee replaced. Excellent job, I was feeling so good. May 30th 2016 I got a staph infection which went into my blood stream. This was a very quick onset, 6 hours. The next morning I had emergency surgery while they still did not know what I had MSSA, or MRSA. They did not do a full removal of the joint. Only the spacer was replaced. They cleaned out the entire joint and felt that I should be OK. I had MSSA, and my medicine was changed from Vancomycin to Cephalaxen. I was then given a PICC Line and on IV antibiotics for 42 days. I continued on Oral Antibiotics, right up until now, April 24th severe pain in my knee again. Went to emergency room, and deja vu', however it does not appear that it got into my bloodstream that I know of. I was not as sick as I was back in 2016. So this time I have had the replacement removed. I was fortunate that they did not need to break bone, and rebuild it. The surgeon, was able to build a antibiotic spacer that will not require me to replace with a new replacement for years if that is my option. our surgeon would not know will take place about damaging any bone, until it you are in surgery. The key to infection is, that antibiotics do not go into your replacement because there is no blood flow. It can grow without your knowledge. I hope everything has worked out well for you. Let me know. The mental side is anguishing as well. They told me it was a 30% chance that I could have a relapse, but that was off the medication. I was still on it.

The surgeon says there are signs of multiple past infections. The muscles are torn there is no longer any real rotator cuff. So I need a reverse mount shoulder replacement. Due to the type of replacement and the past infections some of the bone needs to be split to insert antibiotic packing and some broken to repair the damage done to the bone.

Personally I think being depressed is a pretty natural process of dealing with pain & a lifestyle that you didn't choose. I know it happened to me. I also found that prednisone & other drugs really affected my moods & thinking drastically. Don't give up & don't accept it! I think loss of control over your life is depressing. I was hit suddenly with crippling inflammatory arthritis 6 years ago & I went through hell, couldn't walk or use my hands/arms for much for 2 years. I tried a lot of the prescribed drugs & then while I was waiting for biologic approval as my last resort, I found other things that worked. I researched like crazy, tried everything, & eventually I got better. I haven't been on any drugs for 2 years, nothing. Here I am with improved CRP's blood tests that show inflammation in lower range of normal when it used to be off the charts. I have no symptoms, no pain, energy back & sleeping great. It took me a year to regain strength in my legs & now I can walk 6k, do stairs etc. This is an inflammatory disease & getting rid of inflammation is key. Yes, diet helps etc , get rid of inflammatory foods, sugar etc but you have to keep your spirits up & not lose hope. There are a few still relatively unknown/alternative ways to deal with autoimmune disease that work & are proven, one is an RX with very low side effects, it's cheap & effective. Other is a nutrigenomic that is a natural combo that work with & regulates cell expression because your body produces inflammatory enzymes. This turns down the inflammatory enzyme expression & ramps up the antioxidant enzyme production which in turn heals & normalizes cells.\nNot sure how to get you info as you aren't supposed to post links etc. on this site.

I have had back/neck issues for almost 30 years--some related to traumatic issues (ejection from an aircraft, too many parachute landings), some a factor of RA and Osteoarthritis. Because I was a lifelong athlete and fitness fanatic, I knew most of the recommendations about diet, PT, weight loss, rest (it used to be recommended in the 60s/70s that a serious back injury should involve 3 weeks of conservative bed rest prior to contemplating surgery. (That's now considered one of the worst things you can do--as proven when a journeyman carpenter helped me build a second story deck 28 yrs ago, with 7' concrete pilings and very large pilings/joists, etc. when i was so bent over that I didn't understand if I could even raise my hammer. After 3 days, I was able to walk normally and reduced the pain almost entirely.) For 20 some years, the bone doc community recommended that you bicycle or do other things with a curved back, bent forward. That is until an Australian orthopedist asked if it didn't matter where the prolapsed disc was extruding or the connective tissue/nerve endings/osteophytes might be affected. Currently, that has led to much greater accuracy in prescribing treatment--mostly PT and what type of meds may help (or antagonize your digestive system, etc.)\nIn my own experience--having canceled surgery on my lower back 3X and on my neck twice--I found four factors that contributed greatly to my pain and limited Range of Motion(ROM), flexibility and tightness:\n(1) Overwhelmingly STRESS (be it financial, job, family-related, etc.) contributes greatly to any pain you are describing.\n(2) So does the TYPE OF ACTIVITY you engage in--whether sitting for long hours at work or doing manual labor that taxes your body. A renowned neurosurgeon (whose wife is an orthopedic surgeon) shared with me that when in doubt, DON'T GO UNDER THE KNIFE. His wife had been told by two bone doc colleagues and another neurosurgeon that surgery was her best option (this was 25 years ago). While traveling in Europe, they heard about other options. She found 1 of only 2 Pilates Studios operating in the mid-Adlantic and gave it a shot. Voila! Within 12 weeks, her pain was gone, her flexibility and strength greatly enhanced, and her energy levels were surging. That is why--irrespective of your age, prior athletic ability, or weekly cardio/walking/exercie levels--most docs will recommend some form of yoga (most professional sports employ), pilates, tai chi, qi jong, etc. ALL will help in some way, unless you are simply unable due to pain, prosthetics, or time to engage.\n(3) INSURANCE COVERAGE: As much as the Affordable Care Act has helped those without prior coverage and those who cannot afford the more expensive procedures/medications--even if they have Medicare or Medicaid--there have been ripples of confusion, shock, and exploitive measures by the insurance industry to make it much more difficult for private/self-coverage and employers have reacted to the costs of benefits to their employees by altering percentages/scope of coverage to where it's not only hard to figure out who's on first, but what the costs are gonna be if you make it to second. (A recent surge in hospital and procedural costs due to Out-of-Network factors of which the client is completely unaware has resulted in soaring costs for those who believed they were at least in a \"reasonable envelope\" of Co-Pay expenses.) Worse, in the past decade, the number of more expensive diagnostic procedures (MRIs, CAT/PET scans, biopsies, ultrasounds, etc.) NOT to mention actual surgical costs have in some instances quintupled! Forget the pirate scumbags who raise the costs of cancer drugs and other end-of-life or critical care meds by up to 500-700%. One has every right to feel trapped or in a boxed(botched) canyon of complications.\n(4) THERAPY Options. Apart from the usual suspects (PT, analgesics, manipulation, etc.) there are a variety of non-sanctioned (by FDA) herbals and other \"Alternative Medical Approaches\" out there--not to be confused with this Administration's \"Alternative Facts\" though some flim flam/Brother Love's Travelin Apothecaries still exist--that may, in fact, offer relief. When my father was dying of painful cancer, he had two things which helped him most: weekly massages and a \"managed\" support community of friends and family.\n\nSo if you haven't tried massage, it can help some; dependent upon type/training/skills/experience of the therapist. BUT HERE's A SECRET THAT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SPOTLIGHTED in most medical journals (Mayo Clinic, Lancet, Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins Newsletters, etc.): ACUPUNCTURE is highly successful in lowering pain, loosening connective tissues (even scar tissue), and remediating the inflammation that occurs in most injuries that are not traumatically induced (car wrecks, falls from roofs, etc.) Chinese Medical Training and Acupuncture Certification involve 4,000-6,000 hours of training alone, not to mention lifelong study/improvement by its practioners who use the word \"healing\" more than they do \"preventing or fixing.\"\nMore and more major hospitals are now incorporating this \"Alternative Treatment\" option into their offerings. Their doctors, however, as skilled in physiology or Western medicine as they may be, have usually only trained in a 300 hr. curriculum.\n\nMY OWN EXPERIENCE, for what it's worth. After undergoing serious spinal surgery (C-6/C-7/T-1) that entailed a twisted spinal cord, osteophytes that had almost filled the pathways through the vertebrae, thus closing off nerve paths and irritating surrounding connective muscles/tissues, I continued to have severe neck pain that extended like a triangle into the affected surgical area. After months of physical therapy, pain injections by a talented anesthesiologist at the Pain Management Center of a leading hospital (which also addressed all cancers), and a variety of topical dressings, osteopathic manipulations, and even some gentle tai-chi, I was still in considerable distress. After less than four months of twice weekly acupuncture with a very experienced practitioner, I was virtually pain free. My posture and energy improved and I was utterly amazed that I'd resisted this option for years with various back and joint pains.\n\nUnless you're moving to an area where gridlock isn't present, additional family are available to connect with (though this can mean added stress, too:), there aren't environmental factors that might affect you (San Antonio, for example, is frequently cited as one of the best quality of life/affordable cost of living cities in America; yet a goodly number of folks develop serious allergies to the Cedar trees/plants in the area. Go figure!) and you can find a job without waiting for six months to be employed, it may well be that you'll want to remain in your current locale.\n\nFACT: almost TWO-THIRDS of all PT-related treatments involve the neck, shoulders and upper spine (and some cranial activity) in today's metropolitan/urban areas. And a significant percentage of those are attributed to bending down one's head while \"on the grid\" with mobile devices, whether walking, sitting, or lying down. Even the computer work can entail more than a risk of of hand/elbow/finger neurological disorders. So, too, persistent neck pain.\n\nSorry for the lengthy response, but if you haven't tried massage/acupuncture or some other forms of fitness activity (pilates more strenuous than yoga more strenuous than Tai Chi more strenuous that Qi Jong), might be worth exploring. Good luck and blessings and joy sent your way for a quick recovery.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: RA, fibro, degenerate disk, hip replacement, osteoarthritis","resp_content":"I would not have surgery for pain reduction.

I am also very concerned about a fusion, but prognosis for pain relief is not good (I cannot take anti inflammatory meds) and I have a long time (hopefully!) to live with the pain. So are there options for pain relief? I am still technically healing from surgery and will see my doctor again soon, but I want to gather all the info I can.\n\nThank you.","like_count":"0","tags":["Symptoms"]},"responses":[{"author":"Serg1","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Post Traumatic Arthritis - left wrist...10 years ago?","resp_content":"You might want to ask your surgeon about the possibility of a proximal row carpectomy which is the removal of 3 carpal bones in the wrist.

So far, rheumatoid, Lyme, CRP, ANA, sed rate, TSH, & CBC have all been normal.\n\nBeginning about 4 months ago, I began having intermittent aching pains over the first bone in my R foot and some pain in my R elbow when lifting heavy objects. Then, suddenly a month ago, all the joints on the right side of my body began hurting (incl foot, ankle, knee, wrist, elbow, & shoulder). Over the past few weeks, more and more joints have become involved, including the first knuckle of a few fingers...and it's slowly starting on my left side too, although the vast majority are still on the right side. I'm currently having up to 40 episodes of pain per day. I have NO swelling, warmth, burning, numbness, tingling, rash, etc. Basically no other symptoms. The weirdest part is that they're usually very fleeting and migrating pains, most lasting only a few seconds to a minute or two. Occasionally, something may hurt for hours though.

I just need to vent a bit. A year ago My groin hurt. Then I started to limp. The pain was different than RA flares. (Didbt burn like fire) but ached really bad and was really severe when I put weight on it. I eventually put 2&2 together by ruling out anything else. It was My RA but it had progressed into My hips. In October 2016 it became so severe I couldn't walk without such severe pain, I simply wouldn't walk. I've now been admitted twice for pain management and all they can do is put Me on a PCA pump. I spend 4-5 days in a hospital bed, then 4-5 more days in an in-patient care. With elder patients (nursing home facility) I'm only 44. It has affected My work. So I'm barely making the rent and am lucky to have a patient landlord. I run My own Hardwood flooring company. The \"company\" is Me, My tools and My truck. Sole proprietorship. I'm \"all in\" everything is wrapped up in My business. So....My work causes flare-ups. I go: work-flare-ER-Hospital-In-patient. Twice now. All the steroids they have pumped into Me over 15 years have had bad long term effects. Deterioration of muscle and ligaments. Just like the RA does. So, steroids are as bad if not worse than RA. I've done 10 different DMARDS over the years, some twice, with limited benefit with 2. I did get exposed to TB while on the DMARDS. So I have latent TB now, too. Taking an INH to destroy the TB. I've been ridiculed by the people who supposedly love Me (until they saw the flares) even after. \"It's not THAT bad this time!\" Or....\"your just drug-seeking\" or \"***!! You EVER going to be a MAN again, how long will this \"supposed flare\" going to last!\" I hate the way My fiancé treats Me, but I'm terrified more of being alone with only the disease.

That seems the only way to get a physicians empathy. Despite taking HUGE risks barely being able to turn a steering wheel. I've almost wrecked god knows how many times driving to \"Prove\" the flare. Despite blood tests over and over I've had a Rheumatologist say \"it's all in your head\" until I \"proved\" her wrong. I hate rheumatologists!!! They peddle \"hope\" there is NO CURE!

If I did some hard work around the house or some sort of physical activity with the family, I would pay for it that night with heavy pain in the lower half of my body. To shorten up this story, I am now 61 and I have had 2 more hip surgeries( the new right one had problems, so after 2 years they had to do a revision which is causing heavy pain problems), both knees scoped, minor back surgery, shoulder surgery, 2 different pain management doctors, countless chiropractors, and one final hip + knee surgeon and 1 back surgeon to help me find what to do. Even though over the past 10 years I have had an unbelievable amount of Xrays and MRI's, The hip Doctor wanted a new set including a Bars MRI and other test that I have not heard about. I also point out that if you feel the bottom of my right buttocks you will feel a prominent lump and it starts from the top of my right buttocks all the way down to almost my knee and is very painful. It feels like a pipe or tube of some kind, but hey, what do I know,right. He did feel it and did acknowledge it, so at least I wasn't nuts. I had the test done and on the xrays, the technician put a marker from the top of the lump to the bottom so the doctor could focus on that area. The Doctor said that all the test came back negative. Even the long lump I talked about, the xray showed that area was completely black. It showed nothing. He said it was not my hip,however he said that both my knees should be replaced. But why buy a new garage door if the car doesn't work. I saw the back surgeon that he recommended, and after reading and looking at all the tests I had done, he told me that it wasn't my back and it had to be the hips. He recommended that I go back to the pain management doctor and see what he could do. That was in September and my situation has increasingly has gone south. Next week I am going to another pain management Doctor because I have run out of options. The hip Doctor has told me that if I go to another Doctor, he will me glad to send him everything he did on me. I am wary to go to another surgical place like the Rothman Institute in Philadelphia, because they are surgeons and not diagnoticians, and if they can't make money for all the time they are going to spend, there are a lot of patients in the waiting room where they can.

I am sorry you are going through this and fully understand. Read my story in my profile.\n\nI started having symptoms from serious spinal problems and osteoarthritis in my late teens - over 40 years ago. I had both hips replaced last year - my right in June and my left in November. I am thrilled with the results. The orthopedic surgeon I chose does an anterior approach that is less invasive. My incisions are in front and he does not cut through muscle, but moves it to remove the original hips and install the hips that have a steel shank and ceramic head. My spinal are still just as bad, but I do have less pain and more mobility with my new hips. I had to stop working in 2008 at age 51 due to the pain and functionality problems all this was causing. I had a job in Information Technology, but was not able to sit upright for more than an hour or so. I contracted an SSD attorney and was approved in two months.\n\nI have had multiple diagnostic testing done over the years and various treatments such as physical theraoy, steroid injections and nerve ablation. Those results were temporary and the pain came back worse than before. I am also limited in my current activities and do what I can to help around our home.\n\nCurrently I rely on enteric coated aspirin and muscle relaxers as I am allergic to all opiate drugs. I have a great lift recliner and sleep number bed which help. Also, I see my chiropractor about once per month. Two neurosurgeons have told me that these adjustments are keeping me out of a wheelchair.\n\nI've struggled with obesity since I was 4 years old. I started a program in 2014 and lost over 100 pounds by my second hip surgery in November 2015. Unfortunately, 2016 has been an extremely stressful year for our family and I have gained back about 50 pounds. Things have started to get better so I am again trying to stick to my weight loss surgery. After losing over 100 pounds my pain levels were better.

My BMI was 40 and I weight about 290 at the time. The first surgeon I was working with told me to try and lose weight, sent me through all the pre-op work, then the day before the surgery he cancelled it saying it was too risky. I found a different orthopedic surgeon and he did the surgeries I weighed a bit under 290 at my first surgery and then got down to about 270 by the second. This second surgeon uses a less invasive anterior approach - he goes in from the front and no muscle is cut, just moved as he removes the original bone and inserts the metal with ceramic head implants. Again, I am more than thrilled with the results.\n\nI have battled obesity my entire life - since I was about 4 years old. I was considering gastric sleeve surgery after the first surgeon cancelled the procedure, but then my wife and I realized that if I had the surgery I would be eating less. So, we just decided to eat less anyway. I lost more weight after my surgery in November, but 2016 has been extremely stressful for our family and I gained quite a bit back. The stress is starting to get better so I am losing again.\n\nMy bottom line advice is twofold. Yes, you do need to lose weight and keep it off. The extra weight increases the risks during the surgery and puts pressure on the artificial hips which could shorten their life span and cause you to have them replaced. Second, try and find a surgeon who would be will to do your surgery with the anterior (from the front) approach and work with you as you lose weight.\n\nHave you considered applying for Social Security Disability Insurance? You would definitely qualify and IMHO have a very good chance of being approved. Find an attorney in your area who specializes in SSD and contract them. There should be no initial fee, and if you are approved quickly you may be billed for administrative costs as the attorney gets all your records from your doctors and submits the application for you. If there is a wait, then you will get back pay and the attorney gets a percentage of that. To be honest, given your current condition, I think you would be approved for SSD before you found another job.\n\nI pray all this works out and that you find answers and relief soon.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave\n"},{"author":"yvonneblessed","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you Dave","resp_content":"\nI have applied for disability, it is a slow process indeed.

With all of this said, things are coming together as to why over the years, I've had, problems with a certain area. Whether it's can't get up, or don't even have the drive persay. I have watched adult videos to try and help but even so it is still a no go most of the time. Some days it's there, some days not a chance in hell...I guess what I'm asking is, is there anything that I can do, short of taking the little blue pill? I mean as I mentioned, some days are fine others not so much but its also the having no feeling to orgasm.\n\nAny help/advice on this would be great. My apologies if I posted this in the wrong area.

I too was born with a less severe case of flat feet and have developed tendinitis in them which can be painful, but which I imagine is nowhere near the scale that you are experiencing.

I have been dealing with flares for 5 or more years, and they had been getting more frequent and lasting longer. Pain, swelling and hot joints, the strange thing was it was in the left foot ankle/bone and spread to the toes. I thought Gout, current test prove wrong. My Question is how do you relieve the pain when your unable to walk (the pain intensifies) or stretch. My remedy is icy cold sprays buckets of ice and tight wraps. My Doctor did not prescribe any preventive med, for this. Could it be because of the Thyroid ? I asked his Nurse and wasn't given a clear answer.\nI am on the edge of a flare right now, and will be full blown in a couple of days.","like_count":"0","tags":["RA"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Addie","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: New RA Diagnosis","resp_content":"Hi trisha8040\nI'm sorry that you've been dealing with more frequent and longer flares lately.

I know that you asked your doctor's nurse without success, but talking with your doctor about what medications may be right for you (and his reasons for not prescribing any) is best.
