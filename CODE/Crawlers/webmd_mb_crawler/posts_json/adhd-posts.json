I am 13, but I know more about ADHD than most people twice my age. 13 is young, that does not mean I am immature. People on here post about newly diagnosed or they think they have ADHD. And to those people (and most other adhd people) a 13 year old telling them about it seems crazy. But age does not take away the fact that I have ADHD. It affects me the most too. Now skip through this because you have adhd.\n\nI will talk about various things and I hope that you realize that I am 13. I will talk about a lot, and it revolves around the drugs and effects but also how adhd medicated or not really has an affect on people no matter the age. I hope I do not forget anything.\n\nI keep going back up here because I want to put the most important info closer to the beginning because I know this is one of the things that adhd people hate, reading crap thats first of all long and that is not required. I hope people will see this and want to read it and ask me questions. I really want to see parents asking, kids should not be asking.\n\nI will begin with outreach and how important it is to teach people and most importantly the people most affected by adhd including adhd children.\n\nI would love to see a place where people with adhd can talk and where people with questions about it can ask. This is the closest one I can find. Barely anyone is active and it is a ghost town. Replies are never answered and sometimes people say that they \"procrastinate\" often and say that they sometimes go to sleep late. Then they say that they have adhd, BUT are not diagnosed. Come on now, you will understand what sleep problems are when the harder you try to sleep the longer you stay up. I some times stay up all night because either my mind is going crazy or the meds.\n\nI am going to talk about the medications and also how adhd and the meds affect everything you do.\n\nThere are three different categories of adhd CNS Stimulants (Central Nervous System) I will call them stims.\n\nFirst Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine. Example: Adderall (XR).\nSecond Dexmethylphenidate. Example Focalin (XR).\nLast Methylphenidate. Example: Ritalin (Concerta).\nXR mean extended release 6-12 hours depending on medication. Also Concerta is the name of the XR version of Ritalin. Even me seeing Amphetamine or Meth while talking about drugs is a red flag. Most parents see it as heroin and cocaine. This will come up later.\n\nI have been on Concerta for 4 or 5 years, before that Focalin.\n\nWhen I was around 10 I searched up what Concerta was and found out it was for adhd. At the time I did not think much of that, mostly because I knew that it meant I wouldn't concentrate as well. Now I know that it is a hole, a hole that many adhd people notice later in their \"treatment\".\n\nWhat I mean by the quotes is that to most people treatment is working to cure. It is not. Right now it is only a word that gives hope.\n\nWhat I will talk about right now will lead to the hole I just mentioned. I said that the names of the type stims are a red flag to anyone that has watched Breaking Bad or any crime show. Drug in my mind I think of weed or crack, things like that. That is what adults want us to know that whenever you hear the word drug you run.\n\nThese drugs have warning. People have abused and gotten addicted to these stims. But you dont know you are because you think that the things you feel when you are not taking them are just the side effects.\n\nThese drugs suck. Say bye to your sleeping pattern, appetite, and a lot of other things. You can say hi to headaches, feeling like you do not have feelings I also like to call it being a zombie or robot.\n\nGoing back to the hole I will call it. Doctors say that taking your meds as directed leave a very small window for drug abuse / addiction. So that is saying if I take the same amount of cocaine I have a small chance of addiction? Some people say it is impossible to get addicted to adhd meds. I do not believe that.\n\nAlso I have seen TED Talks or youtube videos where they say that adhd can be used as almost a super power and that we have an advantage because the drugs, or even that we can choose what we want to focus on. This makes people see that they do not want to do homework sometimes, or that they fall asleep sometimes then go and say they had adhd. It sucks when people say that.\n\nFrom a study in 2017 only 20% of children outgrew adhd. Every-time I stop to look for a source I think to my self \"Who is going to read this stupid story by a 13 year old that is 10000000 words\" No one with adhd.\n\nNext videos on youtube. I search adhd on youtube and I see a channel come up a lot. This woman has adhd and has had it for a while. But what I do not see is someone explaining the hell that can come along with adhd. I feel as if writing this no one will ever see this and it is a waste of time.\n\nIf you read this through congratz.

Your dream job is something that makes you happy and excited, you don't get bored at your job, you don't wonder if you are doing it right or better yet why you are doing it wrong when everyone else is effortlessly going about their duties correctly and had the same training as you! Your dream job needs you because you do it best and every person on earth has a purpose.\nNow that you've found yours: Don't give up, don't settle for being a cashier in a buisness you don't like or relate to because you were attracted to the bright \"Help wanted sign\" and you felt you needed a change of scenery.\nLastly,\nCircle your job in red ink and do everything it's going to take to make that your next and ( let's say with a positive attitude your last job:)\nHere is what your last notebook page and circled \"Job will look like,\nMary Jones.

For example, you could be having a reaction to the binders, colorants, or fillers in the generic that aren't in the brand (generics are cheaper, and this is one of the ways it shows).\n\nI wonder if you have tried another stimulant. Perhaps that would solve the problem.\n\nGood luck,\nGina\n"},{"author":"stopgooglingyoursymptoms","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Dark circles under eyes after adderall use.","resp_content":"Hi! Sorry to hear about your side effects! But interesting to read nonetheless.\n\nI was on Adderall (the Corepharma generic [the round bright pink ones] and then Teva [the more familiar orange diamond-shaped ones]) for a while before I switched to Vyvanse, but I've always had major dark circles under my eyes so wouldn't have noticed the difference if it occurred as a side effect.\n\nMy first thought admittedly upon seeing the title of your post was \"it's a stimulant, make sure to take it earlier or lower your dose so you sleep better\" but upon reading your OP it's clear you're getting an adequate amount of sleep and performing proper self-care. Definitely address this concern with your doctor but I would concur with Gina that perhaps the medication is affecting the *quality* of your sleep even if it isn't affecting the quantity.\n\nFor example, the nightly medications I take (sedatives, not stimulants, but I'm only using an example) generally make people tired and will aid them in going to sleep, but actually can make it harder (or prevent entirely, especially for those who tend to be sensitive to medication) to enter REM/dream sleep, which is where all the real rest and recharging you're meant to get from sleep happens. That's something you might be able to gauge at home and mention to your doctor - if you're used to remembering your dreams at least partially and have noticed yourself not remembering any since starting on Adderall or waking up not feeling as rested as you used to, that could possibly be the issue.\n\nAgain, I'd recommend talking to your doctor and if it's really a bothersome side effect there are other stimulants (or even non-stimulant ADHD medications... Shire has one out, I can't remember what it's called, G-something-or-other, but you can look it up on their site) you can try, both amphetamines (my preference, since I take them for narcolepsy, not ADHD) or methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, etc.). Luckily there are lots of options so you and your doctor can experiment with which ones work best for you.\n\nGina is also right about generics. If you aren't sensitive to medication it isn't usually an issue since the same amount and quality of the ACTIVE ingredient is in there (in this case, the amphetamine salts) but INACTIVE ingredients can vary, and some people can have allergic or other negative reactions to ones used in certain generics. Personally I liked the Teva brand ones and found them to be of consistently good quality.\n\n(Or, if the Adderall improves your life and the only real problem it causes is dark circles, there are cosmetic solutions. Like I mentioned, I have dark circles under my eyes 24/7, so I usually use a healthy dose of concealer which lightens the circles a bit while finding matching eyeshadow that I apply to darken my eyelids - it just tends to take the focus off of the circles and make things look a little more symmetrical. That paired with a bold lip color definitely improves things. Just cheap stuff from CVS usually does the trick.)\n\nHope I could help!\nSGYS\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"2 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Dark circles under eyes after adderall use.","resp_content":"This could be happening for many reasons. 1 Diet, if you’re drinking a lot of soda, eating frozen meals... these will definitely make your face swollen, which can cause dark circles. 2 not enough sleep, which you already addressed. 3 Too much masterbation while on this medicine.

I remeber a long time ago asking myself do people day dream as much as me! Then I think back at school. I was in learning support most my life. I never knew why. But looking at it. I think it was because I was in a trance or thinking what I was going to do when I get home. Or next time I was going to skate. Also when I was 13 I thought I had cancer. But I went into my own detail about it like. How was I gonna tell my mum! She would cry. I didn't want her to cry. So I kept it in. Thinking that was it for me. Then thinking of my mum and dad at my funarul. I was crying a lot and didn't want to go school. My mum spotted me one morning and asked me. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I told her. She got me into the Drs and turned out to be fine. But since them day my anxity and mind goes nuts thinking about it all. I find myself driving to work fast all the time and home. I loose my keys wallet and phone around the house all the time! What do people think I should do? I have a 9 week old daughter to. It would also be nice to know for her.

This can make you feel edgy, and anxious...and sometimes extremeIy angry/emotional (aka super Cranky-pants). This is somewhat similar to what you hear some drug users refer to as being \"yakked out\". You will adjust to it after a bit. Even though the docs will tell you your med is long-acting, personally my meds are almost completely worn off by around hour 6 or so. Stuff that is supposed to be 8 or 12 hour-long meds are a joke to me. They metabolize too quickly in my system, and I have always been like that. I feel you on the pulse issue also. Maybe try a very mild drug that treats both your high pulse rate and high blood pressure- personally, I take Metropropolol for this. It is blood pressure drug, but very mild- I actually take it for my SVT (my Tachycardia) primarily, as I have had that my whole life. It works great for that. I didnt realize it helped with blood pressure for a long time, but then I learned that is actually the primary purpose of that medication. Added bonus, it helps with headaches for me, personally, as it is a mild Beta blocker. I only need half a tablet once a day. It also helps with the leg cramping I get at night, weirdly enough. It is a cheap medication, cost wise, and personally I think it might be a good place to start. Side effects are minimal, if at all. You may get physically used to the comings and goings of your ADHD meds over the next few months....but if not, it's definitely worth a try.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/101275/newly-diagnosed-adult--side-effects-question"},{"post":{"author":"lauren0804","post_time":"10 months ago","post_title":"For anyone: adult, teen, or child, who just needs some comfort.","post_content":"If you're reading this and you have ADHD, I'm sorry for the long speech. I always skip around if I have a lengthy read ahead of me, and you all probably aren't much different. I tried to space it out a bit, and reading it myself, the space helped a little bit. :D\n\n\nI was diagnosed with severe ADHD at 5 years old. My mother always believed it was some type of \"stigma\" and wouldn't tell any of my teachers when I was a kid. She just recognized it once every three months, when it was time to buy the medicine. When I was in kindergarten, I got my first prescription of Concerta. I took it every day. No breaks, no holidays. Looking back, I was a unhealthily skinny kid. I was at least fifteen to twenty pounds underweight, and I had been nicknamed \"Zombie\" because of the zoned-out manner my dosage of Concerta gave me.\n\nBack to the topic, my mother didn't research ADHD enough, or didn't care enough, to learn that children and teens with ADHD are far different than normal teens and kids. When I was in eighth grade, I stopped taking my medication because at school, people were constantly asking me if I was okay, or if I was depressed. When I came home from school, I had to force myself to act happy and excited in order to please my parents, who would get angry with me if I continued with the \"zombie\" manner.\n\nIt exhausted me, so I quit my meds. Immediately, I started to gain weight. People began to tell me I looked healthier, with a little \"meat on my bones\". It made me happy. Like a true ADHD kid, I'd rather fit in at school and please my family than care about my own self-being and grades. Grades were a big deal. All over the Web, you hear about these kids and teens with ADHD flunking school. Not me. My parents emphasized the \"meds will fix everything\" stigma, and ignored me mentally.\n\nWhen kids with ADHD reach their teenage years, ADHD will fluctuate their emotions. In other words, teen without ADHD's emotions = much less than teen with ADHD's emotions. \"If you take your medicine, you'll get good grades.\" \"If you don't take your medicine, you'll essentially fail out of high school and never amount to anything.\" Exact words. The first time I got a B in eighth grade (conveniently soon after I had quit my medication, in fact) I cried for an hour, too afraid to even talk to my parents about my situation. I've been longing to talk to them. Longing for them to even understand the strenuous experience I'm going through.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed, it made my mother just want to make me look so smart that it never crossed anyone's minds that I even had ADHD. She had my school allow me to skip my first grade year. I had just made my first real friends. I remember begging her to not do it, but there was no choice for me. Now, I'm 14 and going into junior year, turning 15 just 6 days before I become a junior. I tell myself all the time to just focus. To just look at the book like it's more than just a jumble of words that I don't want to read. I blame myself all the time. Sometimes, I'll be winding down for bed and I'll start crying uncontrollably, hoping that one day, I'll be able to just \"get over myself\".\n\nWhen people see others with disorders like depression, they say, \"Oh, they can't help it, it's not their fault.\" (All due respect to people with depression, I may be diagnosed with it as well. My school counselor is trying to get me to see a psychiatrist, because she thinks I have depression based off of what my teachers say about the way I act. Of course, I can't talk to my parents. Yay, statistics are in my favor.) Anyway, when people look at ADHDers, they say, \"You need to stop. You can help it, it's just sitting still.\" \"It's just an assignment.\"\n\nI watched a TedTalk about living with ADHD (I can't remember for the life of me who hosted, but I remember she has a channel on YouTube called HowToADHD), and it brought me to the point where I was sitting there sobbing, I related so well. I wish I could come up to all of you struggling with ADHD and say, \"I know. It's hard, but places like here exist so we can talk to each other and tell each other about our hardships and struggles.\" I wish I could be right there for everyone who reads this, and just relate our ADHD laughs, cries, and anger to each other. I hope this post helped you all in some way. ADHD isn't something wrong with you, remember that.\n\nYou are not ADHD. It doesn't define you.

I am so, so sorry that your parents don't understand your ADHD. Not having support at home makes everything so much harder. I'm glad you find comfort and support on this forum. I was not diagnosed until I was middle aged, because I am a female with the mainly inattentive type of ADHD, but I think back to my years in public schools, and it was a constant struggle. My older sister was a brainiac who made almost all As, while my grades where all over the place, depending on whether I found the class interesting or not. I remember hearing my second grade teacher tell my mom \"she could be doing so much better!\", but I had no idea what to do differently.\n\nMedication is both a blessing and a curse. I hope you find a way to balance the benefits and the drawbacks. I also hope you find a way to develop a more open dialog with your parents where you can stand up for your needs, and get them to understand and support you. And you probably are dealing with depression. How could you not be? I have come to realize that I have struggled with depression since I was in grade school. It isn't severe, but it does make life a little more difficult, but I have it because life is a little more difficult for me, because of the ADHD. A good therapist can really help. Learning more about ADHD can help. As I have learned more about the condition (reading lots of books and online information from credible sources (very important!)) I have found myself better able to cope. That doesn't mean I don't have anymore problems, but understanding what's going on helps in dealing with them.\n\nHang in there (do you really have a choice?

If not, then sorry, dear!!), my name is Erin. I am a 38 year old mother of, well, now 5, since I now have two fabulous step kiddos. I was diagnosed well over two years ago with ADHD by my therapist. I have YET to be able to receive a formal diagnosis from an actual doc, or be medicated, which, unlike your unfortunate experience, is just exactly what I myself am in desperate need of.\nI have had the condition my entire life, never diagnosed, but after reading up on it, MAN!!!! It explains soooooo much of what's been unexplainable to me for a lifetime. A lifetime spent lonely, crying or restlessly roaming about my house, cleaning, baking, just whiling away useless hours on the internet or social media (the latter after I was a grown person, mind you. There was NO wandering the house at night before I left my parents home.)MANY nights till I finally just fell out from exhaustion. I have ALWAYS had the hardest time sleeping, and been skinny as a rail, super, super active and hyper, talk a mile a minute, and I mean CONSTANTLY, I TRY to stop talking and I still can't. I talk to myself when no one is around unless I have music playing I can sing along to.\nI ALWAYS felt different, off, WRONG, somehow, not like other people. And you know what, Lauren, it's taken a whole lot of aging and hurting, and research, and talking to people in the know, and finally, just good old fashioned, real and true, actual love from another human, that kind you don't find around every corner, in order for me to come to the most important conclusion I've EVER come to.\nI AM DIFFERENT, and I'm NOT like everyone else, but you know what, FRICKIN A!!!!!! Honey, and no offense intended, ok, promise, but PEOPLE ARE SHEEP!!!!! AND THATS WHAT YOUR SORRY PARENTS ARE TOO, DAMMIT!!!! I make NO MORE APOLOGIES for myself anymore and neither should you, darlin. And you should NOT ACCEPT YOUR PARENTS BAA BAA VIEW OF YOUR REALITY. Because that's what it is, sweetheart, your reality, NOT something WRONG with you, not something screwed up in your head. It's simply who you are, honey, and if most of us are any indication, ITS WHO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE. You need some therapy, darlin, and in the worst way, someone to talk to who will NEVER JUDGE, NEVER MAKE YOU FEEL WRONG OR BADLY, and HELP you to understand and come to terms with who you are. And if your parents can't get on board that train, darlin, you find a way to your local health department, and for free, and without parental consent, those helpful ladies will point you in the direction of the help you need.\nAnd girl, Don't you accept that they just pretend your ADHD doesn't exist!!! Put it out there, in their faces. Talk about it, TO THEM, show them the research you've found, and tell them, honey!!! Tell them that you desperately NEED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT. That you have issues you badly NEED to get off of your chest, and that their ignorance and denial are hurting you very badly!!! And don't give up when it doesn't work RIGHT AWAY. KEEP AT IT!!!! Persistence is your friend.\nTwo of my kiddos have the condition, and I know it, I see myself and my life mirrored every time I look into their eyes. And I've already set up assessment and eval for both. They will NOT live my lonely, pain, filled and awful existence. And you should NOT DO IT EITHER!!!!\nAnd coming to these forums and others like them, and posting, and putting yourself out there, kid, that's a FABULOUS start. There is a website, and it's called additudemag.com. You go to that site, and you bookmark the crap out of, darlin. Trust me when I say, it is the ONLY add/ADHD site you will EVER NEED. And if they don't have it, they'll have a link to who does. Explore the site. Read about us. Engage with your parents, and let them know how sad and lonely you are. You never know, darlin, sometimes, people will surprise you in the most profoundly amazing ways. My family certainly has. And good luck and may you have a life as wonderful as you obviously are, sweet girl.\nSincerely,\nThe Nuttiest Momma Around.\n"},{"author":"morallymortality","resp_time":"8 months ago","resp_title":"RE: For anyone: adult, teen, or child, who just needs some comfort.","resp_content":"Hey, Lauren your story is very deep.

ADHD can be confusing!\n\n1. Sure, it's possible that you do not have ADHD.\n\nADHD traits are human traits. What makes the diagnosis is how many of those traits one has, along with their severity, in the presence of impairment. That is, these symptoms must be having a negative impact on your life.\n\n2. Then there's something I call \"electronics-induced ADHD.\" It's not a real diagnosis. But it does acknowledge the very real risks of unrestrained access to electronic devices. Even \"restrained\" access has an adverse effect. At any rate, we'd all best limit our interactions with our phones, tablets, texting, social media, etc.\n\n3. You said that the Ritalin \"worked for an hour but would wear off.\" How do you know it worked? What did that mean, specifically?\n\n4. Good for you. You've done your research on Concerta generics. And I bet you came across my blog in so doing. :-)\n\n5. Treatment for Adult ADHD is severely deficient in the U.S.—and even worse in other countries. The best results come to those who self-educate and self-advocate.\n\n6. Some prescribers have a \"throw the spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks\" approach to treating ADHD. There should be a more methodical approach.\n\nFor example, there is no \"average starting dose.\" Some people are slow metabolizers and will require a very small dose. If they start out too high, to poor effect, they might abandon what could be a useful medication if taken at a lower dose.\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, I gave up on the hope that more physicians will do a better job and then set out to educate the patients and loved ones. You can read about a rational approach to identifying a stimulant and dose in my first book. (Is It You, Me, or Adult A.D.D.?) It's based on interviews with top clinical and research experts, along with my observations and sense of what people need to know. In order for medication to make sense.\n\n7. I am sad and angry that you've been left to figure all this out on your own, as too many people have been and are.\n\n8. Yes, you definitely need other strategies. For example: Become best friends with our calendar/planner. There is no way around it. Stimulant medication should help you to better utilize these strategies, but it won't take the place of them.\n\n9. I think you will feel less confused if you can avoid comparing yourself to other students and their opinions about ADHD, their ability to stay focused in class, etc.\n\nStick to reliable sources, where you can learn and compare your own experience since you were a child. If those sources ring a strong bell for you and you also scored high on the evaluation for ADHD, it's worth ...paying attention to.\n\nI hope this helps.\n1\n"},{"author":"davidparker121","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thanks to everybody for taking their time for writing such a thoughtful response, I really appreciate it.","resp_content":"\nJust a couple more question if anybody has time.\n\nI think the Ritalin worked because usually when I read a book or watch an educational video off medication, I have to pull my phone out or be watching a T.V show on the side or have music playing or sometimes I'll have just have the video play in the background and I'll do something else that's unrelated/related, and like let's say I'm watching an educational video for my self learning purposes(the video is like a lecture), they'll say something that I'm curious about (or I'll have a random thought in my head that's unrelated) then I'll need to pause the video to google what I'm curious about (And most of the time when this happens forget what I was gonna google after pausing the video, and I will need to like go back or think for 4 minutes) and then I'll read up on that, then while reading up on that I'll want to google something else that I thought about while reading which may or may not be related to the original video I was trying to watch, and then I'll want to take a break and watch a show or something stupid because it's been 2 hours and before you know it it's been 5 hours and I was only 3 minutes into my video.\n\nI guess I haven't tried reading while on medication yet even though I tell myself everyday I will try, but off medication when I read, I'll be reading 3 pages and I'll hear what I'm reading loud and clear in my head, but after those 3 pages I'll have completely forgot what I read in the past 3 pages and have no idea what went on. But I think this is normal for some people, so maybe not ADHD related?\n\nWhen I took Ritalin the above^ didn't really happen.\n\nAnd when you say ADHD must be having a negative impact on my life... I dropped out of university after 3/4 in the way of my first year because of severe procrastination (unable to finish big projects that require planning and time, could barely start them) and lack of motivation (this might be normal, I wasn't very passionate about my field). I also skipped a lot of school in highschool because when I missed a due date for a project which obviously happened A LOT, I would skip that day of school to try and finish the project.. and this happened many times and my highschool friends tease me to this day about that habit of mine, obviously not in a malicious way but yeah. And more than that, I feel anything that require academics I struggle with, like right now I'm doing independent study on Game theory (branch of mathematics) and it's so hard for me to stay focused and finish one thing before starting something else and I procrastinate on everything I'm going to do. Like I'll wake up in the morning, tell my self I'm going to do A B C D E F G but what happens is I'll start A and do maybe a quarter, and then I'll look a little into B, then start C and do a bit of that, then after I go back to A and do a bit more, then I eat dinner watch something stupid play a video game, look back at B and then I'll say I'll finish A B C E F G tomorrow then I'll start D and spend 12 minutes on it but then I'll say it's too late I'm going to bed and then I essentially wasted my whole day and I barely did any of A B C D E F G I said I was going to do. Also there are long video series that will have someone teach and explain Game Theory, and my to watch list is safely more then 40 hours long of videos, because I tell myself I'm going to watch this video after I finish the other videos but I never really finish any video.\n\nOther then academics, my relationship with my friends is okay, I rarely ask to hang out first because I enjoy independent activities and even though I like hanging out with friends I could go a very long time just doing things by myself, and when they ask my to hang out I'll usually make time and say yes and this is usually fine, I get along with all my friends very well, not alot of conflict. With family I'd say it's fine, nothing worth saying. With my partners I'd say I use to overreact and get angry in small minor situations and have many fights and arguments, and I guess I'm working on this, I'm not sure if this is ADHD related or just my personality but I guess that aspect needs work. Also sometimes, not very frequently but I try really hard not to get angry, but I guess I \"bottle up my anger\" and sometimes in a small situation I'll say I've had enough and I'll have uncontrollable anger and start cussing and throwing things, and I've punched a hole in a wall once, this doesn't happen often but happened more then twice in my life, and happened more often when I was in a relationship with my partner, we lived in an apartment and the police came a few times because of the loud shouting and yelling and objects being thrown. I'm not sure if that's ADHD related?\n\nAlso my procrastination goes beyond academics, my laundry only gets done when I'm literally running out of cloths to wear and that pressure will make me go do it, I've been putting off getting my driving license for 3 years now, if I need to go out and fix/buy something at a store or anywhere, I'll wait until the day I need that something to go fix/buy (and sometimes I'll be too late and it'll be too late to fix the thing or by the time I buy the thing I won't need it anymore). And I'm extremely forgetful in fast happening events, every time I take my pill in the morning I can't remember me actually taking the pill, I only remember drinking the water. I can never remember me locking the door but only putting the keys in my pocket. And when I go to the washroom, I can never remember if I washed my hands or not, but my hands smell like soap. And I guess I forget activities and events, like I have forgotten my friends birthday party, if someone asks me to hang out I might like completely forget that and stand them up, if someone asks me to do something Ill go do it but then forget what they asked me to do in the first place.\n\nAlso there was a situation where I was doing an 30 minute activity that I enjoy, and I said \"after I finish this activity I need to go do A(and A is related to the activity I was doing)\", and I swear to god this scenario happened 10+ times and I never remember to go do A after I finish the activity even though every time I start the activity I tell myself I'm going to do A after.\n\nIn case ^ isn't clear, lets say I play a 30 minute video game, and I play this video game 9 times on a certain day. Every time when I start the video game, I say \"after I finish this game I need to change a setting\" and I'm reminded every time I start the video game because when I start the video game I see and encounter a setting that isn't to my preference. But when I finish the game I just start another one right away and I would have forgot to change the setting, and then I'm reminded again I need to change the setting because I see the setting is off again when I start and get into my next game , and it's just a cycle until I stop playing.\n\nWhat other aspect of life should my ADHD affect should I have it?\n\nAnd yes, I try not to compare myself to people without ADHD it's just that since the symptoms can happen with anyone, I'm afraid I'll be one of those people who are overreacting and looking for an excuse for their laziness/inactivity, when I just want either an explanation or help.\n\nAlso whats funny is I procrastinated taking my Ritalin when I first got them, I only started taking them when it was a week before my follow up appointment with my GP and he wanted to know how they worked. Haha\n\nAlso I edited this post multiple times now because I forgot something I wanted to say hence the length.\n\nAlso having a messy workspace stresses me out but every time I clean it it inevitably gets messy again.\n\nIf anybody took the time to read all of that and give any amount of help I'm extremely grateful. Thank you.\n"},{"author":"timstime","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Confused stressed worried about ADD","resp_content":"I didn't hear anything about trying the best ADD medication available ADDERALL there are 10 20 and 30 mil pills If u haven't tried this please do .

I’m wondering if anyone else has been prescribed 54 mg of Concerta X 2 per day. I realize this is a high dose but I’m told I metabolize medications very quickly (this goes for all my meds not just the ADHA prescriptions). I’ve been on ADHD meds for over 4 years and have generally been very happy with its effects on my scatterbrained and distracted self, lol. I take my first 54 mg at 6am and the second 54 mg at 2pm. I get between 5-6 hours of sleep daily which is twice as much as I was getting for most of my adult life. Prior to the ADHD diagnosis, my life was plagued by feelings of worry and stress over my poor performance in the adulting arena which led to insomnia, overeating, depression and anxiety. To be honest I’ve been an insomniac since childhood, I’ve never been able to lay down and fall asleep without tossing and turning for at least an hour while worrying about the state of the world. Oh to have been diagnosed with ADHD as a child, I may have actually enjoyed school and completed a degree. I was always told I was just dumb and lazy.\n\nI won’t dump all my questions at once but would be interested in knowing why taking 2 x 27 mg rather than 1 x 54 mg appears to be more effective. I ran out of the 54 mg and wanted to use up the extras I had before refilling my Rx. Could I be imagining this difference? My pharmacist shrugged his shoulders and told me there is no difference so rather than ignore my gut, I’m reaching out to those who actually take this med for their insight.\n\nThank you,\nFisher","like_count":"0","tags":["Treatment & Care","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[{"author":"rosiecont","resp_time":"6 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Concerta dose vs effect","resp_content":"Concerta is very effective for ADHA, but it has side effects.

School was horrible and because I didn't fit the cookie cutter way that the school system teaches I was always made to believe that there was something wrong with me. I was unmotivated, didn't try hard enough, didnt listen. I can't count how many report cards I received that had the comments at the bottom. Very sweet, funny and nice little girl who could do so well if she would just put her mind to it. I was tested at the recommendation of teachers when I was 8 but was never given a diagnosis of anything. Possible visual learning disorder. I has a special Educational Plan put in place but still didn't have anything substantial. I was reading and writing at a kindergarten level at the age of 8 but there was apparently nothing wrong with me. Since then no further testing was done. I continued to fail all throughout school and was just pushed through. I graduated with very little other than all level 3 classes and very poor self esteem. My parents and teachers just continued to explain that I would do so much better if I would only try harder. Although my experience in school was very negative, I did gain some valuable lessons from age 5-18. I learned compassion and understanding for others and gained appreciation to these who were kind and patient with me. I had a few unbelievable resource teachers throughout the years who seemed to be the only adults who really understood that It wasn't a matter of being lazy and unmotivated. There dedication to not giving up on teaching me sparked a passion in me. I decided after high school to go to college and take human services and early childhood education. I did better in college than I ever could have imagined doing graduating from ECE with honours. I now have been working in the childcare field for 10 years and love my job. Recently though I find myself struggling again. I am now working in a much larger room with about 45 kids and 6 coworkers. They will talk to me and although I respond, have no idea what they have just said. I very frequently loose and forget things. Forget what I am doing. My thoughts are all over the place and have not been able to complete anything before moving onto something new. I have never actually gotten a formal diagnosis but now more than ever I feel like it's time. I love my job and I am good at it but strive to be the best I can possibly be. I need more information! I need to understand what's going on with my brain! Until probably the last 5 years I thought living like this was just normal. That I really was just dumb. It has really just recently been that a light switch went off and I refuse to believe any longer that I am just unmotivated and lazy. Sorry for the length. Honestly dont even expect any response. Just needed to Wright this out and get it off my chest.

I had been stumbling through adult life as an underachiever, and a disorganized employee, but I was getting by. When perimenopause hit I had a terrible time staying focused, and became even more emotionally volatile than ever. Fortunately I had a good therapist, and it was in a session with him that I was finally diagnosed with AD/HD, mainly inattentive type. Like you I was the child who was sweet and well behaved, but just not achieving to potential. I couldn't figure out how I could be both smart and dumb at the same time. If a class was interesting to me I aced it without trying. If a class wasn't interesting I barely passed. Anyway, having a therapist who understood AD/HD was really helpful (he has since retired), and learning more about AD/HD also helped (working in a public library made it really easy to find books on the subject). If you don't already have a therapist I suggest you seek one out. Also, is there any way you can move to a situation with fewer children? I suspect that many children, despite the coworkers, is too much for you. I know that as whatever situation I'm in becomes more and more hectic I become less and less able to focus effectively. I just become overwhelmed. I also started taking a small dose of Prozac, and that seemed to help. I tried the drugs recommended for AD/HD, but it turns out that amphetamine type drugs make me groggy, so I couldn't use those, but I do think they're worth trying. I hope all of this helps.

However, most importantly\n\n\"if I can help anyone relate, or stop them ending up like me then I want them to know they are not alone. Somewhere out there are a lot of people like me but are too scared to open up. So I want to help them begin this process\".\n(His words).\n\n\n\n\n\"A face of no emotion. But you see a Painted Clown\".\n\nI am emptiness. I am distant. Everyone appears blurred, I’m not ignoring you some days I can’t get out of my own head I just need time. I know there are people that love but you can’t see that. You’re alone. You see me laugh make or hear me comment everyone laughs everyone can make a comment but that’s a mask you think you see me but that's my painted face. That face you say is a painted clown. Many say I waffle, I can’t get to the point. Those who are brave enough to see the real me say this too but they look back now my words bring them clarity.\nDidn’t you get any sleep? It feels like this, but only feels like not physically. When there's sleep there is knowledge. when you are awake you are aware of certain things. When I am awake I feel oppressed constrained into a box by my own mind and by educations stereotyped ADHD box. As day passes, more knocks, more scowls more judgement. How I feel I can’t trust; the more awake the stronger it feels.\nI’m dissociated. I am paused. I am inattentive ADHD. Every second going down a road lost in a lost thought. We all do this I just do it more than you. I don’t realise when I go. I rarely know how I get here I don’t recognise where I go.\nI am distanced. I am white noise. ‘Simple things are not so simple’ so when you ask me take out my why are you wearing that pass me this pull out your work. Multiple demands = multiple speeds.”In a minute”. Then I’m ordered do it now then it often ends up in a fight. To just stop what I’m literally doing or what I’m thinking to do something else is extremely stressful no matter how “petty” it may sound.\nI am fight. I am anger. I am switched. When I am angry I feel numb, I don’t feel. Yet, breathing makes my lungs hurt, my head pulses, my heart hurts. My ears scream. So how can I not feel as I punch, as I outburst as I grab something sharp pierce a pillow pierce my skin. My red mist pierces with words. But mainly I’m not angry at you. You just caught me at the wrong time. My outbursts are because my mind is flooded. Anger gives me adrenaline. The adrenaline alights. This is my fuel.\nA lot of people think they see me but they are blind. So they make more demands, find another volume switch. When I lose it they are just words its not personal. Punishment at this point adds petrol to my fuel so I just fight back harder they harder you cry the harder I fight.\nFight or flight. Fight an instinct we all have but my fight is my attempt to flight. In school I cant literally fight so I have to flight. I need to leave, find a new room but I’m trapped. Rapidly pushed into that oppressive box. Please I need to flight this train track takes an automatic turn. Please I’m afraid now my mind is in fight. Flight for survival. Flight from fear.\n\nMy conscious streams; everyone is different in their conscious mind everyone is specified to their own my but made to conform to others but they should be allowed to appear as their own unique mind would it be weird to be just real\n\nMy stream of consciousness.\n\nEnds.\n\n\"Judgements, Stereotyped limited views on ADHD and anxiety stop you from opening up.

Around 10:30 am or so I noticed I was STONED. Not a opioid high, I felt like I smoked a couple bowls of hash. I def know the difference between the two highs, I’ve been smoking for almost 40 years. Anyways, I’m confused as to where this buzz came from. I know Amphetamines do not produce this feeling and as I said I’ve never had any side effects from Lyrica. I looked all over, but cannot find anything about the two potentiating each other. Has anyone ever experienced or heard of this? Don’t get me wrong, it’s lots of fun. But I definitely could not be productive at work like this.

Their physicians and pharmacists tell them, \"Generic is exactly the same as brand.\" But that is not true. Not when it comes to the, at last count, 7 generics for Concerta.\n\nNone of these generics have the key technology that makes Concerta Concerta. It's called OROS and it's made by a company called Alza. Concerta pills are imprinted with the word \"Alza\" for that reason.\n\nSo, look at your pills. Do they say \"Alza\"?\n\nThere is one exception when it comes to Concerta and it's generics.\n\nThere is something called an \"authorized\" generic. It is a generic in name only; it is the brand marketed and sold as a generic, so it's cheaper than brand.\n\nIf you can get either the brand Concerta or the \"authorized\" generic, you'll have actual Concerta, not a generic facsimile.\n\nSo, that's the first thing to check -- and the most likely.\n\nAlso possible:\n\n1. You've been overusing the \"burst of energy\" to go without sufficient sleep, eating well, etc.., and it's catching up with you.\n\nStimulant medications work best on a healthy, well-red and rested body.\n\n2.

Especially at what is considered a rather large dose of 72mg for Concerta.\n\nEven though stimulants take effect and clear the system rather quickly, your body (including your brain) has been on Concerta for many years. That means that your body has gotten used to it. Even though there isn't \"withdrawal\" per se, there is definitely up and downstream effects.\n\nIdeally, you and your prescribing professional would help you take stock of your ADHD-related challenges, to see what are symptoms that merit medical treatment and what are poor habits around organization, sheduling, etc. You just might have to do this yourself.\n\nIn my experience, \"tips\" seldom take folks with ADHD to the finish line.\n\nThere are the obvious steps, of course, for anyone to improve attention span, such as reducing distractions, turning off devices (and limiting use overall), and setting timers (e.g. 30 minutes of work and then a 5-minute break to walk around).\n\nThese tips are abundant online. But typically, they are best applied when there is a foundation of effective medication.\n\nAlso: check to see if your Concerta is brand or generic; it can make a big difference.\n\nGood luck,\nGina Pera\n1\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"10 months ago","resp_title":"Your tip helped me a lot.

I was struggling recently with trying to quit smoking, not because of nicotine withdrawal, but because I could not focus on anything. Like, weeks in, I would look at some paperwork and it was as though it was in a different language. I was crying it was awful. It led me to look into the link between ADHD and nicotine, and sure enough, nicotine works as a crutch for people with focus issues, making the habit even more engrained and difficult to kick. It's what led me to get on meds, because I couldn't quit smoking without addressing my ADHD. So, this study I read up on also mentioned that non-smoking adults with these problems, who are not on medication, can try nicotine lozenges when they are struggling to focus at work. Of course, if you try this, you should use them very sparingly, so as to not form an addiction to nicotine. You can also google mindfulness meditations to help stay focused, or exercises to help train your mind to keep attached to what's in front of you. I think Kaiser has a bunch on their website you can check out for free.

The idea is to get maximum benefit with minimum side effects.\n\nAlso, are you taking generic or brand? That can make a difference.\n\nThe difference between Ritalin and Ritalin LA is basically this: Ritalin LA adds a second dose a few hours later withour your having to remember to take another pill.

I used to feel the same way about \"medicating children\"—or even adults—for ADHD.\n\nTwenty years later, having written two books based on the science and met thousands of adults with ADHD and quite a few children and teens with ADHD, I have a different view.\n\nIf both your son's teacher and physician confirm that ADHD is likely, that is a serious consideration for you.\n\nI encourage you to keep an open mind about medication. ADHD is a neurobiological condition; it's not just a \"behavior\" issue.\n\nLeft untreated, ADHD can adversely affect every aspect of life, from childhood on.\n\nI am assuming that you are raising your child in a healthy environment and with healthy routines (for example: around diet, exercise, sunshine, organized home life, with a minimum of chaos or conflict).\n\nBeyond that, if ADHD symptoms are severe enough, they can sabotage all your best efforts at parenting and your child's best efforts at paying attention, focusing, and so on. If your child needed vision correction in the form of eyeglasses, I bet you wouldn't hesitate to get eyeglasses for him. The brain is much more complex than the eyes -- and in fact the brain controls much of our ability to see and interpret what we are seeing.\n\nI'm wondering why, if both teacher and physician confirm ADHD, that this hasn't been noticed at home. Sometimes ADHD in a partner limits the ability to see ADHD behavior in a child; it's seen as \"normal\" -- just like that parent's childhood behavior.\n\nI encourage you to read up on ADHD treatment here at WebMD and at other reliable sites such as http://CHADD.org . The more educated you are, the less irrational fear you will have about the potential of medicaion AND the better advocate you will be for your child.\n\ngood luck!\n\nGina Pera\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/87317/adhd-5-year-old-son"},{"post":{"author":"mceciliathompson","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"ADD","post_content":"I am 21 and having trouble finding out what type of doctor can/will prescribe my ADD medication, since I moved.

She had ADHD and might be more prone to think our child has it while I might be biased in the other direction.\n\nHis lack of focus on his school work is, in my opinion, his only symptom. He is, and has always been a very well behaved child. He is very emphatheic to others, can wait his turn, is never figity. He his very accomplsihed in other areas. For example, he has taught himself guitar, drums and keyboards. For the last several years he has organized neighborhood children and produced several videos.

My plan is, once my son finishes primary school, grade 7, I will take him to a technical school where he can decide on a more practical stream or theoretical. There is nothing wrong with ADHD, it is hereditary and it does exist, it is our duties as parents to assist our kids with opportunities we were never given, due to lack of knowledge.

Rather than determine the root cause of the failures, Tris dismissed out-of-specification results and simply tweaked the testing method \"several times.\"\nThose tweaks meant Tris was \"deviating from the method deemed acceptable\" for Quillivant XR detailed in the drug's approval application, the FDA argued. What's more, Tris didn't appear to address the problem — the agency noted one lot of drug product still failed under the revised testing method.\n\nDive Insight:\nThe FDA's letter, dated March 26, extends a lengthy past of production problems at the Monmouth Junction plant. Three prior inspections identified similar issues with Tris' investigations. Meanwhile, drug product that failed dissolution testing was passing through to market.\n\nThe letter also creates a fuller picture of the supply troubles Pfizer has experienced with Quillivant XR. The big pharma recalled multiple lots of the product last year because they didn't meet dissolution specifications.\n\nBy November, it was telling healthcare professionals that a manufacturing issue had caused a shortage of both Quillivant XR (methylphenidate HCl) oral suspension and QuilliChew ER (methylphenidate HCl) chewable tablets.\n\nPfizer more recently said it would release 11 lots of Quillivant XR to address the supply shortage, but cautioned that each of the lots might not meet dissolution test specifications either.\n\nAside from the Quillivant XR​ debacle, inspectors determined that in the last six months of 2016, Tris received at least two dozen complaints concerning roughly 1,000 bottles of morphine sulfate oral solution seen leaking or under-filled.\n\nTris blamed shipping for the damaged bottles, and concluded its investigation even though more complaints were rolling in, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Your response stated you would conduct a 'holistic' investigation to identify a root cause for the leaking bottles. After this investigation, you attributed the leaks to a specific lot of caps that had cracks in their liners and remained in inventory for an extended time without retesting.

Rather than determine the root cause of the failures, Tris dismissed out-of-specification results and simply tweaked the testing method \"several times.\"\nThose tweaks meant Tris was \"deviating from the method deemed acceptable\" for Quillivant XR detailed in the drug's approval application, the FDA argued. What's more, Tris didn't appear to address the problem — the agency noted one lot of drug product still failed under the revised testing method.\n\nDive Insight:\nThe FDA's letter, dated March 26, extends a lengthy past of production problems at the Monmouth Junction plant. Three prior inspections identified similar issues with Tris' investigations. Meanwhile, drug product that failed dissolution testing was passing through to market.\n\nThe letter also creates a fuller picture of the supply troubles Pfizer has experienced with Quillivant XR. The big pharma recalled multiple lots of the product last year because they didn't meet dissolution specifications.\n\nBy November, it was telling healthcare professionals that a manufacturing issue had caused a shortage of both Quillivant XR (methylphenidate HCl) oral suspension and QuilliChew ER (methylphenidate HCl) chewable tablets.\n\nPfizer more recently said it would release 11 lots of Quillivant XR to address the supply shortage, but cautioned that each of the lots might not meet dissolution test specifications either.\n\nAside from the Quillivant XR​ debacle, inspectors determined that in the last six months of 2016, Tris received at least two dozen complaints concerning roughly 1,000 bottles of morphine sulfate oral solution seen leaking or under-filled.\n\nTris blamed shipping for the damaged bottles, and concluded its investigation even though more complaints were rolling in, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Your response stated you would conduct a 'holistic' investigation to identify a root cause for the leaking bottles.

I am not bipolar! I've read a lot about bipolar and I have some symptoms, but mine present differently. I don't have mania and my lows are not that low. I just know I am not bipolar, and these psychiatrists keep insisting that I am. The last one I saw, which was a few days ago, listened to me talk for less than 5 minutes and said, oh yeah, you're bipolar, then proceeded to charge me 300.00 for the visit. I said no, I am adhd. He said he agreed, but we would deal with that way down the road. How??? For that kind of money, I should've spent the day there with electrodes hooked up to me, trying to figure out what's wrong with my brain. How can you tell what's wrong with anyone after talking to them for five minutes? When I was a child, I stepped in a smoldering fire, not realizing that it was still burning underneath. I had 3rd degree burns on my feet, but I was holding my hands, so my Mom thought it was my hands that were burned, so she was holding my hands under the water. That's what I feel like is going one with damned doctors. They are treating a part of my brain that's not on fire. It's the same story every time! I keep going to these psychiatrists with high hopes that someone is going to help me, but they don't. They just put me on these ridiculous meds that do nothing for me. The only med that has ever helped me, was Vyvanse, but the person I was seeing, took me off of it. I am so fed up with psychiatrists. I have been going to them my entire life, and they have never helped me. I am still just as screwed up as I have every been. This last guy actually told me that I might have a personality disorder, in which case there was nothing he could do for me. This is after talking to me for 5 minutes. I had another psychiatrist tell me there was nothing they could do for me, and that my condition is untreatable. My last great experience was with a woman who would get angry with me for questioning her diagnosis, then she kept me waiting for almost two hours for my last appointment. I had to pick up my four year old son, and had to leave. I had just paid a 50.00 co pay and asked for it back because I couldn't stay. The psychiatrist came out of her office and said, \"I am not on his schedule, tell him not to come back here.\" She said this in front of her staff and the entire waiting room. This was after 3 years of going to this... person. This wasn't urgent care, this was a doctor who deals with people with mental issues, and she chooses to embarrass me because I couldn't wait 3 hours for my appointment. I am not someone who uses my issues as an excuse. I work really hard in spite of them. I have learned, by myself, some amazing coping techniques, but they aren't working like they used to. I am a successful college professor, and I have to be incredibly organized and on top of things. I'm having a more difficult time hiding my issues from the people I work with. I really just want to find someone who will spend some time with me, and help me.","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/78159/diagnosis-frustration"},{"post":{"author":"livlaughluv2000","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Undiagnosed ADHD","post_content":"I am just fuming. I've recently started my first year of college and while the workload for freshman year hasn't been much thus far, I still have been having issues. Having all this space to myself allowed me to have a lot more time to think - it almost seems like too much at times. Sometimes I'll just be alone in my dorm room and sit on my bed and state into space. My mind will go from thought to thought and I find myself paralyzed, a slave to this endless train of thought.\nIn addition to this I keep leaving assignments to the last second because I simply cannot get myself to concentrate on them beforehand. This has always been a problem since high school, where I stayed up countless nights to achieve the almost all straight A's I earned throughout my high school years.\nI finally took action after yesterday, when I finished a final project just mere minutes before it was due. It was such a tight squeeze to finish it and I was haunted once again by that awful feeling of irresponsibility, internally bashing myself for not taking initiative and finishing it ahead of time when in reality, I was unable to.\nThis was really the last straw, I knew something had to be up. I am intelligent and talented and I know I'm capable of so many things, I'm even trying to teach myself a 3rd language for Pete's sake, but I can never really \"finish\" anything.\nADHD in my home was a blasphemous word. I distinctly recall having mentioned it to my mom, who I believe has her own slew of mental illnesses, and her immediately dismissing the topic. She would say that ADHD is just something that psychiatrists made up to make more money from prescriptions. As a child I believed her. I even questioned whether I had it which she would also dismiss as nonsense.\n8 years later, here I am, not being able to focus on the most insignificant thing. I feel debilitated, and paralyzed by my thoughts.\nI finally called my father to ask him if my elementary school teachers ever discussed the topic of ADHD with my parents. His answer didn't even phase me. He confirmed that yes indeed my second grade teacher and teachers that followed all tried to tell them. In fact at one time, one of them even proved it to my parents by having them visit school. She gave me and my fellow students the same set of directions and I would fail to complete all of them as opposed to my classmates who got it all done. My arrogant mother denied it all, remarking later that \"how dare she label him\" and that \"they just want to label the hispanics with things like ADHD so that they can fall behind.\"\nFunny enough, my father also strongly believes that my mother herself has the disorder, as she is always scrambling last minute to get stuff done and the attempts that are made to prevent this are futile. She is always late to things, forgets her keys constantly, this among other things that I too suffer from. What makes this realization disturbing is that it is very likely that throughout my childhood, my mother constantly bashed me for being late to school, taking forever to get things done, things that she also did, and I'm afraid she was in reality, bashing her inner ADHD self whom she was and still denies, through me, who was at the time, an innocent unknowing child.\nUpon being told this literally yesterday I was, as previously mentioned, fuming. This disorder has prevented me from doing so many things like having free time, spending time with friends in high school etc. Granted I attended a rigorous high school, which made it even more difficult to get good grades. I was always staying up trying to finish the next book, add the last touches on that essay, solve that math problem, when it was my Adhd that prevented my from focusing. Reflecting back it seems almost superhuman to have pushed through this unknown ailment to the extent that I did.\nI relayed my anger to my father, asking him why he didn't bother to be the parent and take his child to the doctor when his teacher literally told you and proved to you that he probably has Adhd. What makes this more painful is that his irresponsibility to do this serves as yet another treatment to his neglect of me as a child.\nWe've finally resolved to go to the doctor in a week and even that feels long. I've never been more sure of something in my life and I can't wait to get diagnosed and treated so that I can hopefully experience \"having my brain turned on\" as one put it in an article about the disorder.\nStill awaiting my appointment, I find myself waking up with an unnamable anxiety some mornings, including this morning. My heart thumps heavily and I can't subdue it with the coping mechanisms I have used my whole life. This is such a debilitating disorder, but I'm so happy to have come to this realization.","like_count":"1","tags":["Living With","Symptoms","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Undiagnosed ADHD","resp_content":"Well in cases like this you need to provide evidence, such as a journal -- perhaps list your symptoms as well...

I have all those same symptoms and my dad has said those exact words to me and my little sister (who also has adhd) more times than I can count. I have a few things to say that I hope will help and I'm gonna apologize in advance for how ridiculously long this post is about to be because honestly I could go on forever.\n\n1) I got diagnosed when I was 15. I was lucky enough to have a mom who supported me and listened to me when I told her I wanted to be tested, but I remember it was very scary for me to talk to her about it and I felt like a failure for asking for help. My dad never has really believed in adhd though, so I understand how hard and invalidating it is for someone in your life to say or act like what you're experiencing isn't real and is due to some sort of character flaw or something you've done wrong. I don't really have any magic suggestion other than keep talking to her about it, dont give up, and try not to internalize those things she says. Low self esteem is very common in girls with adhd and it's hard for us not to blame ourselves and take those things people say personally, even when on the outside we're telling others that it's not our fault. Be nice to yourself! No one is perfect, when you tell others that you're trying your best, it's ok to actually believe that yourself! ADHD is real and all of those things you're experiencing are things I've experienced myself, and just know that having a messy room and not doing your homework don't make you a bad, stupid, or unworthy person. Those things aren't everything, even though it feels like it sometimes.\n\n2) if your mom won't get you help, here's a few things that help me besides medication or other things that require a diagnosis:\n\n-keep a detailed planner(this one is hard for me to actually do, but the weeks that I am able to remember to write everything down and actually check it, I do much better and feel much less overwhelmed)\n\n-EXERCISE!!! This one is HUGE for me. It helps me clear my mind and makes me feel more awake and focused and also does WONDERS for my self confidence which is one of the biggest struggles of add.\n\n-have a specific place where you do homework, once again I don't always do this one but I've found in college when I go to the library and make myself stay there until I finish something I'll actually be able to do it instead of procrastinating. Bring healthy snacks to keep you occupied and not too bored and try not to use your phone too much.\n\n-find a friend or teacher or school counselor or online support group or someone to talk to who actually will listen about your adhd. The biggest help for me in getting diagnosed was that I felt that I wasn't alone and that there wasn't something wrong with me as a person causing me to \"mess up\" all the time. feeling understood and knowing that you are not a bad person or lazy is SO IMPORTANT for anyone, but especially us adhd folks.\n\n-know that there's good weeks and bad weeks. It's ok to mess up. It's ok to get criticized. It's ok to not be doing something productive every minute of every day. Relaxing after a long day doesn't make you lazy. It's important to be nice to yourself and compliment yourself and feel good about yourself even when you procrastinate or feel like you're letting people down. Every one struggles with these feelings, but they are amplified in those of us who have adhd. I know from experience its way easier said than done, but whenever you feel those negative thoughts and feelings towards yourself try to replace them with a positive thought or something you like about yourself. SELF LOVE AND CARE IS SO SO SO IMPORTANT AND YOU DO DESERVE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nOk sorry again for the literal novel, but I hope if anything you know that you aren't alone and there's nothing wrong with you. Keep fighting and working hard and be proud of yourself for admitting you need help-for me that was the hardest part.\n\nLastly, know it gets better! College is way better for me and my adhd than middle school ever was. So stay strong! You've got a lot to look forward to and you can do this!\n\nBest of luck in everything, I'll be praying for you and your situation\n"},{"author":"tori_renee","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Undiagnosed, Underage and Unhappy","resp_content":"If you really think this may be your problem you can always talk with your school's guidance counselors.

Because you're keenly aware of your surroundings at all times, you will be more likely to be exceptional at Natural Science and field work. Your ability to hyper-focus can be a significant tactical advantage in negotiations and other social situations where keen observations are critical. Other traits that you mention such as creativity are independents of whether you have ADHD or not. If you are also creative, taking a stimulant to control ADHD symptoms will often dull creativity. ADHD can also make it difficult to succeed creatively if your task is too large, spanning multiple days. Ideal creative tasks are ones that have at most a four hour duration where hyperfocus can be your ally and you have time afterwards to rest or nap. I have friends that do this and they are astonishingly productive. Extroversion is another independent trait. If you want to be more outgoing, you can certainly improve those skills by making an effort every day to connect with people that you meet such as at a grocery store, while in line at a coffee shop, or at a Meetup group.

This might be why your unsure or feel uncomfortable when the situation happens. Ive been living with ADD all my life and did not get diagnosed until 4 months ago. I have moderate ADD but personally I have not had a problem with wanting to be in a relationship, in fact I do not like to be alone which resulted in me having a couple of toxic relationships.\n\nI think you just may not be ready for a relationship hun. Youre only 15 and im now 21 but i remember how it was in highschool. TBH highschool relationships majority of the time do not work out. Yall are still growing in maturity and personality wise. I know so many people from high school that have changed a lot or just a little but seeing people change is scary. Even if you do decide to date someone in high school it most likely won't last for too long. high school sweethearts a rare and envied.\n\nDo not feel bad or worried about how you are feeling its normal. I am sure your instincts will kick in when you're ready and relationships are the last thing you should be worrying about at your age. Trust me I got distracted about it and it only resulted in unnecessary pain and confusion when i should have been more focused on my friends/family and SCHOOL. lol just wait if you can till college bc at that age people are more likely to be more mature and have possibly figured out who they are and what they like.\n\nGoodluck ! :)\n1\n"},{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Does ADHD normally have an impact on your romantic relationships?","resp_content":"Hi there,\n\nHow smart you are, to even be asking these questions and noticing the phenomenon that you describe.\n\nIndeed, being 15 (especially in 2018!) is not easy. Neither is having ADHD. Put them both together, and you are wise to be cautious and to take things slowly!\n\nI would encourage you, as a young woman, to be first focused on your goals and activities. It can be all too easy to capitulate to someone else's needs without considering your own. And having ADHD can make it that much harder to sort out. (There can be a vulnerability to responding to the environment rather than one's own needs or desires.)\n\nThe feeling of being \"panicked\" and \"like a cornered animal\" when asked on a date could be related to ADHD. If you're not ready, you're not ready. Take some time to sort out your feelings.\n\nIf the people around you are casually dating, preferably in groups, maybe you can join a group event. But if the poeple around you are in serious relationships at 15, well, if it were me, I would try to find friends who are more focused on activities, goals, friendships, and their future.\n\nThis book is the best on girls with ADHD, in my opinion.

High school it does seem like everyone is dating but once you get to college you realize that not dating in high school is way more common than you think.\n\nI've also felt that panicky feeling you described, I literally ran away from a friend of mine in high school who gave me a stuffed bear on Valentine's Day! And same thing, whenever I figure out someone likes me I always either think that I like them back and then realize that I actually don't or freak out and ruin whatever friendship we had. Idk if it's adhd related, but I've always kinda figured it was because a) it's nice and flattering to be liked and I want a boyfriend so I subconsciously convince myself that I like them too and b) because I'm an empathetic person and I'm terrified of confrontation, hurting people, and people being mad at me and someone liking me that I don't like back brings all of that up.\n\nOne thing I can say is don't be in a rush to date just because everyone else is doing it! Take your time and find a person that you really like and are attracted to. Be wary of any feelings towards someone that only start after you find out they like you; I once convinced myself I liked a guy because of this and dated him and I can tell you dating someone who you don't actually have strong feelings for is just awful!

I was put on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine) for depression that was a result from many years of untreated ADD and adderall 15mg IR in the morning and 10mg around 4p.m.. The medication has helped me so much with college and my daily life. I feel like my \"real\" self on the medication, the person who i always knew i could be and in another perspective \"normal\". I have always been very intelligent and that was mainly my problem of not getting help sooner bc i did not know i had ADD until now (21). I was told by a few medical friends that i might have ADD and I immediately was like \"NAH i cant have ADD bc im too smart to have it\". After doing research about it i was so shocked and even emotional when i saw all the symptoms of having ADD/ADHD as i have been suffering from it my whole life and had no idea. I am a female and my symptoms were different than the stereotypical disruptive male symptoms.\n\nNow being on the smallest dosage of adderall and enjoying the results i still have some concerns. I do have some bad side effects since i am small (4'11) and tend to feel all medications very strongly.\n\nSide effects: issues with body temp regulating ( extremely cold when inside, super hot when outside), nerve pain/muscle pain, forgetting to eat= feeling really *** in the morning, irritability, having to drink a *** TON of water (9+ bottles a day), mouth ulcers, and tired when not on the medication.\n\nThe side effects aren't my main concerns since i am taking supplements and making sure im taking care of my body. I just noticed that when I take my medicine i feel good, confident and happy that i am being productive and how i know i should be. But when it comes time for my afternoon dose and if i don't take it i feel the \"comedown\" and get slightly anxious and irritable as well as my head hurting sometimes. my doctor told me to take a small dose to help with the come down and it works but its scary to know i have to take more to feel ok throughout the day. Also when i choose to take a day off from taking the medicine i am really really tired, and seem to feel like my \"old\" self but slightly exaggerated (lazy, sad, tired, lower self-esteem). I am really worried bc i am pre med student and know i will have to be on this medication in med school. When i don't take my medicine or don't take my second dose i don't like how it makes me feel. Do i have to take this medication for the rest of my life? Can i not be the person i know i am deep down without the medication? Should i take the medication everyday to avoid the come down or should i be taking days off? will taking this medication for a long time, or at least when im done with med school and get off, hurt my brain or body? Or since ADD/ADHD has to do with a chemical imbalance of specific neurotransmitters, should i be needing to take the medication to be healthy and functioning correctly?\n\nIf any of you have experience or feel the same way i have i would really like your advice.

Im really sorry to hear about your troubles with your BF... I have just been diagnosed with ADD for about 4 months now and im a female. Personally living with ADD, i do not have problems showing my affection with words or with actions. From what you have described about your BF's childhood and his condition, i think it is mainly his up-bringing that has made it difficult for him to show you affection with words. I am also a psychology major and have learned that early development is a MAJOR factor in how people's personalities turn out. If his father or mother didn't really show love or affection with words or actions then that is probably why he is having difficulty doing so. He just isn't used to it or doesn't really know how because no one really showed or taught it to him. People also show their love in different ways as well as wanting to be loved in certain ways. If he is on ADHD medication then that could also affect his ability to show love because personally the medication makes me a little irritable and less affectionate. Kinda like a robot but not SO cold, just a little less in tune with my happy emotions. Having ADHD is also linked to developing depression. I developed depression from ADHD and didn't even know that it was real depression since it progressed slowly as i got older until i was a my lowest point and went to a psychiatrist. I thought it was just how i was. He could potentially be suffering from this as well. Asking him to be more loving with words requires a lot of emotional strength and confidence for someone who doesn't naturally do this. My advice is to have a serious talk about your needs and be understanding about how difficult it seems to be for him. Communication and compromises are key. But you have to understand people are the way they are at a certain point and you can't ask them to change unless they are willing to. I had this same problem with an EX that suffered from anxiety and depression. I loved him and supported him for 4 years but was not getting my emotional needs fulfilled. Asking him to change only made it worse by hurting each other further and I regretfully decided to break up with him because it wasn't fair to me or him. Ultimately you should make your happiness a priority and should not have to sacrifice what is really important for your long term happiness/well being. I know a lot of people who stay in relationships that aren't fulfilling their essential needs and it only makes things worse by asking people to change or settling, despite how much you love them. Talk to him about it or ask yourself are you willing to sacrifice important factors of your happiness for the rest of your life.

You literally just completely described me. I'm also 15, female, and have really bad ADHD. I have also been in and out of periods identical to what you just described. In elementary school, my grades were amazing (except for the missing assignments), and it was the same for 6th grade and most of 7th. But then my grades started to slip. Sometimes I would completely forget about an assignment, or even more often, I would do the assignment and just lose it or forget to turn it in. My dad, who I have always had a less than perfect relationship with, constantly said \"I'm disappointed in you\" and nothing else. He would just walk out. My mom would yell at me about me grades, and I felt stupid and useless. My step-siblings were doing really well in school, and being compared to them was a terrible feeling. I started to feel like I would never meet my parent's expectations or amount to anything worth being proud of. And I had my fair share of breakdowns, too. My stepmom sent me over the edge twice. I don't even remember what the first time was about, but I was in my room, back against the wall, hugging my knees, and sobbing to the point where I actually couldn't breathe. I started hyperventilating and I felt vulnerable and pathetic. She just stood there and told me that I was overreacting. I have also had thoughts of self-harm in the past. At one of my lowest points, I was having suicidal thoughts. I had come extremely close to cutting myself numerous times, and had even thought of suicide. I lost my feeling of self-worth. But I thought about my family. My Nana, who had just had her long-term boyfriend kill himself, my older sister, who is one of my biggest role-models, my friends, and everyone else that I loved. I know that sometimes it seems like you won't be missed, but there is ALWAYS someone who loves you and cares about you. I told my mom about the thoughts I was having, and she just told me that she loved me and that everything would be okay. I remember I felt like this huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders, and I started seeing a therapist. It allowed me to get whatever I needed to get rid of off of my chest and provided my with an emotional outlet. I still get feelings of solitude often, even though I have lots of amazing friends, but they pass. It's hard being the only one around who actually has ADHD and knowing how it feels, I get that.

It's surely designed to sell you with visual impact, not with information about the ingredients.\n\nAmino acids can be helpful to some people, including people with ADHD. The proteins in amino acids that we get from food can compete with each other for receptors, and so we have a hard time \"uptaking\" some of them. And some of us have variations in receptors that make uptake different.\n\nIndividual amino acids, taken on an empty stomach (no competition) can be a useful strategy for some. I know some people with ADHD who feel they gain benefit from various dopamine precursors, such as L-Tyrosine. But typically not as a long-term strategy.\n\nFirst, though, you want to make sure that you aren't supplementing with amino acids that are going to create more imbalance, not less.\n\nI'm also skeptical of the bundling of these amino acids in this product.\n\nYour is a developing brain and body, Max.

if a subject doesn’t interest me, i can never tune in during class regardless of how much i need to. ex 1: ap world was a relentlessly boring class, but i really needed to engage in class to understand. i wouldn’t do my notes because those were incredibly long and exhausting, so i wouldn’t know anything about what we were talking about in class. ex 2: in english 10, we talked for weeks on end about literary devices and what they can do for graphic novels. eventually we had to read part of a book that just went on ENDLESSLY about all this stupid stuff and i sped through really quickly just to have it done. i didn’t pick up on any of the content except for the effectiveness of icons (i don’t remember the context so this knowledge wasn’t even helpful to me at the end of it all). afterwards, we had to discuss with our table what we thought about it, and because i didn’t pick up on much of anything, i had to try to sound like i was fascinated by iconography when in actuality i was talking out of my ass.\n\nmakes me straight up just feel stupid and that i don’t care enough about school when i really really do. no one else except my best friend has trouble focusing on school stuff like i do.\n\nOften does not seem to listen when spoken to directly:\n\n• school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.\n• social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.\n\nmakes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance\n\nOften does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:\n\n• school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.\n• home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.\n\ni feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me\n\nOften has difficulty organising tasks and activities:\n\n• school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.\ni’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.\n• home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.\n• social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.\n\nthis makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.\n\nOften avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort:\n\n• school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.\n\nthis makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.\n\nIs easily distracted by extraneous stimuli:\n\n• every context - if there’s something that seems more interesting than what i’m doing, i’ll choose to focus on that rather than suffer through something comparatively boring. ex 1: we have school issued laptops that have very few game websites blocked, so if i’m in a class that’s not holding my attention i’ll just play games instead. ex 2: in choir we have music stands and lots of breaks between the times that we sing, so on most days i’m on my phone in that class when i shouldn’t be just checking my email or instagram. ex 3: when i’m at home supposed to be doing homework, i’ll usually watch netflix instead because i’m able to. ex 4: if im having a boring conversation with a teacher or acquaintance, i’ll try to look at their face or behind them to find something that’s a little more interesting.\n\nthis makes me feel super rude and disrespectful to the people that are trying to hold my attention because i don’t pay attention to them.\n\nIs often forgetful in daily activities:\n\n• school/ social - i’ll often forget what i’m talking about halfway through a sentence if i’m slightly interrupted. ex 1 (school): during socratic seminars where you’re expected to make articulate arguments out loud, i forget what i’m saying halfway through a point and i have to scramble to try to finish what i’m saying and have it connect to whatever i was saying last. in ninth grade we were doing a seminar about romeo and juliet and i was talking about who knows what up until i lost my train of thought and couldn’t get it back. ex 2 (social): more times than not, i’ll be talking with a friend and forget what i’m saying in the middle of the sentence and not be able to return to what i was saying without help.\n\nit makes me feel so slow and stupid. i don’t know anyone else that forgets everything midway through a conversation, so i always get kind of frustrated with how dumb i look.\n\nhyperactive/impulsive\n\nOften talks excessively:\n\n• social - if im really interested in a topic, i won’t stop talking about it. ex 1: i get really excited by psycho-analyzing people with my friends and i’ll talk over them for long periods of time saying what i think and why i think that.\n\ni feel rude because i don’t let other people talk when we’re in a two way conversation.\n\nOften blurts out answers before a question has been completed:\n\n• social - a lot of the time i’ll try to guess what people are saying so they finish they’re question quicker. i mostly do this with people around my age that are more forgiving, but it sometimes happens with teachers and i always feel really bad afterwards because i feel like i disrespected them. ex 1: i was at a park with two acquaintances and my best friend, but one of the acquaintances said he wanted to talk to me in private so we sat on a bench while the others walked away. he basically went on to tell me how he fell in love with my personality like never before and how he wanted a relationship with me. i wasn’t really surprised so it wasn’t like i was anxious about it or anything but i was still trying to finish all of his sentences and answer his questions about a relationship before he finished asking. i wasn’t helping his nerves at all, and i knew that, but i still did it for the entire conversation.\n\nthis just makes me feel rude because i can never just let people talk. i always have to come in at random to try to get the conversation to go quicker.\n\nOften interrupts or intrudes on others:\n\n• social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.\n\nthis makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.\n\nother notes:\n\n• pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.\nif it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.\n• i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.\n• i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.\n• i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them.\n• when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow.","like_count":"0","tags":["ADHD in Children","Symptoms","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: i’m not sure if i have adhd or if i’m just a hypochondriac.","resp_content":"I read nearly half of your story and I can already tell you have some type of ADD/ADHD possibly other organizational disorders.

In my observation, it seems to help more with mood, irritability, and sleep.\n\nSecond, are you getting enough sleep?\n\nNo medication will compensate for sleep deprivation.\n\nIt's hard to make other suggestions, not knowing your lifestyle, etc. But exercise in the morning, getting a full night's sleep, and taking breaks while you study (get up and move....do jumping jacks, run in place, whatever you can to get the blood pumping).\n\nSome people find that sipping on a glass of lemonade that contains a bit of sugar helps, too.

There were separate results for ADD and sleep apnea, but none for a relationship between the two. That's why I shared my story on Facebook, at https://www.facebook.com/notes/jay-spencer/tear-down-this-wall/2072634689430553/\n\nShort version: 20 years after my diagnosis with ADD (at age 49), I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. One month after using a CPAP machine, I no longer needed any medicine. The medication helped the symptoms, but cured nothing. The CPAP machine was a CURE.\n\nADD/ADHD has no single known cause, and (as such) has no \"cure.\" Its presence is established only by its collection of symptoms. (There are many drugs that ease thew symptoms, all with side effects.)\n\nThe symptoms of sleep apnea are virtually identical to those of ADD, and IT HAS a cure.\n\nMy strongest recommendation: if you suspect you have, or are diagnosed with, ADD or ADHD, Get Tested For Sleep Apnea. If that's what you have, skip the expense and side effects of all those drugs. (As a veteran, I get the machine and all supplies for it for free.)\n\nSleep Apnea is not just about snoring (although a CPAP machine puts a stop to snoring). It's about cumulative physical and mental damage. When your airway is obstructed by excessive tissue in the throat, a cycle repeats of 1)cessation of breathing, 2) buildup of CO2 in the lungs, 3) an autonomic response of a release of adrenaline, which wakes you up enough to get you to roll on one side, allowing breathing to resume, but not enough to bring you to full consciousness. This cycle typically repeats a hundred times a night. Your mind suffers from lowered oxygen levels and low-quality, non-restorative sleep. Not only do you wake up tired, your mental functions suffer all day.\n\nIn addition, those 100 shots of adrenaline every night have cumulative negative effects on both body and mind.\n\nQuestions I can't answer: do ALL people \"who have ADD/ADHD\" actually suffer from undiagnosed sleep apnea instead? Does ADD, as some claim, not exist? Have there been any studies connecting \"ADD\" and sleep apnea? (I have found nothing hitting this target. If you have, please respond.)\n\nQuestions I CAN answer: are medical professionals aware of the overlap of symptoms? (In my experience, no.) is Big Pharma motivated to find cures, rather than medicines to mask symptoms? (NO.) Will most people in authority avoid addressing this issue? (Yes.) Are healthcare and other professionals in contact with the affected population surprised when informed of the overlap in symptoms between ADD and sleep apnea? Always.\n\nCan I make a difference? Maybe. Likely not through official channels, but directly to the public. Most of us are affected, directly or indirectly, by this pandemic. I'm trying to arrange a TED talk on the subject.","like_count":"2","tags":["ADHD in Children","Symptoms","Treatment & Care","Diagnosis","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/52165/the-connection-between-add-and-sleep-apnea"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Adhd","post_content":"I also have ADHD and dislike taking pills, i also have a strong cough and barely sleeping at night.

My doctor once told me, \"People with ADHD aren't lazy, in fact they're usually trying harder than other people.\" And it's because we see less results that we feel lazy.\n\nSo instead of trying harder, we need to do things differently. The school system isn't set up for people who are ADHD, so you need to create the system that works for you. Unfortunately ADHD affects everyone differently so there's no one-fits-all, but we usually do things in order of emergency, interest, and novelty. When I was in high school and college, I would thrive on a last minute deadline. The upcoming deadline helps give us a sense of emergency, and it's really common among people with ADHD and it brings us into a hyper focused state.\nADHD isn't a lack of attention as much as it is selective attention. So when I say what works for you, I mean whatever situation or activity you find it easiest to focus. Think of something you can do for hours or when you're at your best, you may need to carry a notebook around and jot it down throughout the day. When you find what personally motivates you, and not everyone else, you can more easily make a system that works for you.\n\nAlso, avoid TV and video games as much as possible, especially during crunch time. You can lose hours and before you know it you're out of time.\n\nThere is a website called ADDitude, and through the years I've found a bunch of helpful articles, I'd definitely check it out. Also Dr. Barbara Cohen has an amazing podcast if you're a podcast person. I strongly suggest to check those out, not only do they give great advice, but they remind us that we're not crazy, lazy, or stupid. We're different, and that's okay. Being ADHD comes with a lot of positive qualities as well.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your situation. Remember you're not alone, but you are unique. Having ADHD can be a blessing or a curse, for most of us it's a bit of both. I wish you the best of luck!!\n\n\"Everybody is a genius.

(I thought more ADD rather than ADHD because she just couldn't focus on school.) Seemed like every time we went to the doctor she was increasing her Adderal dose. In August the increase bumped her up to 30mg. Not cool!! I found out that she was self harming and had a plan to commit suicide. In October she told me she didn't like the way they were making her feel and refused to take them. I contacted the doctor and she finally was able to see us in November. Which she had been off the meds for almost a month. During that time I got my baby back...spunkiness, laughing, enjoying life, caring and thoughtful...something I hadn't seen in awhile. Anyways, at the doctors visit (a month later) the doctor was asking about her episodes. At which time, my daughter said she doesn't feel that way anymore...we had to go to the er for a mental evaluation. Ok whatever, it's protocal. The case worker said it sounded like the meds triggered her into a bipolar depression state and require behavioral therapy. So we are doing that. In the meantime I am enjoying my daughter again. She said she feels normal BUT her grades are struggling just like before. (from A-B Honor Roll to failing 2 classes) The reason to be put on the meds...to focus better in school. I have also noticed recently she is binge eating. I guess after saying all of that; my daughter needs something to help her focus more and binge eating less.

My mom help me a little by talking with my principle or guidance conciler and setting up a 504 plan. This plan is make for kids who have ADHD or learning disorders. This plan will give your child extended time on her tests and assignments. It's will also give you or her the option to chose where she wants to sit in class. So if she sits in the back right now, and can't really focus she can definitely ask the teacher if she can move seats to the front if the class. There are so many more things in the 504 plan that may help your child, I would recommend you do some reasearch and with this plan if she does not want her friends to know they will never know its all kept private.

And YES, there is absolutely hope for her to feel better, binge-eat less, and not turn into what you described as her behavior on Adderall.\n\nI'll try to respond to each point.\n\n1. Adderall is horribly over-prescribed and abused.\n\nThough it might be the best choice of stimulant for the minority of people, it can cause big problems for others.\n\nI wrote this post about it in 2013, and it's still the most visited post on my blog today. https://adhdrollercoaster.org/adhd-news-and-research/the-tragic-truth-of-adderal-or-madderall/\n\n2. ADHD treatment involves trying several types of stimulants at a low dose, gradually increasing.\n\nThis is hardly ever done. That sounds the case with your daughter.\n\n3. ADHD treatment also involves identifying the commonly co-existing conditions: e.g. depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder.\n\nThis is too often overlooked.\n\nTaking a stimulant alone without stabilizing these other conditions can cause an exacerbation of those conditions.\n\n4. Please find a new psychiatrist.\n\n5. That \"spunkiness, etc\" is great when it's not accompanied by ADHD-related fallout.\n\nSometimes parents and friends feel the person with ADHD has been \"tamed\" by the medication. In some cases this is due to too high a dose. But in other cases, the medication is helping the person to function in a more well-balanced way.\n\nSome people with ADHD deal with their lack of focus and distractibility by entertaining others. Others might enjoy it, but it does not serve the person with ADHD. If those parents and friends need entertainment, there's always comedy specials on TV.\n\n6. The return of \"thoughtfulness\"\n\nThat's another indication that the Adderall was really not a good choice for her. Especially at that high a dose. It might have caused her to \"mono-focus\" -- and sometimes the fallout from that is cutting.\n\n7. Bipolar Disorder is different than the manic-like side effects from too much Adderall.\n\nSo, I'm not sure about that social worker's assessment or knowledge of ADHD and its treatment strategies.\n\n9. Binge-eating\n\nYes, binge-eating and obesity are associated with untreated ADHD.\n\nI encourage you to learn as much as you can about ADHD treatment. She will need your help in guiding treatment.\n\nThe sorry truth is that many mental-health professionals are simply not educated about ADHD and its treatment strategies. Self-advocacy is a must.\n\nYou might find helpful this article on a common-sense approach to ADHD medications. It includes a warning about the potential problems with Adderall. https://adhdrollercoaster.org/adhd-news-and-research/the-tragic-truth-of-adderal-or-madderall/\n\nI hope this helps. good luck!\n\nGina Pera\n"},{"author":"alliekatiebeth","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: ADHD Med side effects","resp_content":"I have ADHD, Aspergers, and too many other challenges to name.

Do they have anti-medication or anti-physician biases?\n\nIf you do have ADHD, chances are good that at least one of your parents also has ADHD. That might affect that parent's attitude toward the diagnosis and medication treatment.\n\nAnyway, to your question: \"Any advice on how to ask my parents to get me tested?\"\n\nI'm sorry to be unable to offer a simple answer. :-(\n\nThe truth is that some physicians and therapists don't have a clue about ADHD, and they make a huge mistake in dismissing it or misdiagnosing it.\n\nIf your parents take you to a random \"mental-health professional,\" it's the luck of the draw. And often, when it comes to ADHD expertise, it's bad luck.\n\nIf your parents haven't already noticed your potential ADHD-related challenges, you might risk a lot leaving them to make the decisions here.\n\nSo, if you can, talk to your friends and see if they can recommend a smart physician. That way, you'll at least have a name to start with.\n\nAlso, write down in brief bullet points what you feel are your ADHD-related challenges. Ask your friends about their challenges and, if they take medication, how medication has improved them.\n\nIf you have a ADHD-savvy counselor at school, recruit that person to help you talk to your parents.\n\nIn the end, you might not actually have ADHD. You might not be getting enough sleep, not getting a nutritious diet, or maybe over-doing it on the electronic devices. If that's the case, try to improve in those areas and see how you feel.\n\nGood luck!\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"},{"author":"djameels","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Advice needed for a 15 year old","resp_content":"i am also 15 and I think you should say this.\nhey mom/ or dad which ever you prefer. what you should say.

New to this sight , first post. Bear with me its been a long & difficult road the past several years. Met my ex. back in 2005. Hit if off right off the bat. She was previously divorced a year before. We married in 2007. Shortly after our marriage i started noticing odd behaviors. My ex. had difficult time getting to sleep at night, really hard time getting up in the mornings to the point that she would be physically awake but would not be consciously awake for 15 - 20 min. She would be hostile to me even if i tried talking to her shortly after waking.\nShe has many of the Adhd symptoms in adult women. Places money just anywhere in the house, inside several drawers, on several tables & just about everywhere you could imagine. She would place empty cigarette cartons in lots of different cloths drawers also. My ex. would be in the shower for 45 min. to a hour & not even realize it when i mentioned it to her. Back then we could hardly ever get to a app. , family event on time unless i kept nagging her to get it in gear. She never would fill out any school forms for the kids. She would not ever get involved in our finances. I ask numerous times to let me show her ours bills & where we were at financially & she just showed no interest at all. I would have our two kids ready to go & we would be waiting on her. She would very seldom do any house cleaning. Our home was a mess if i didn't clean it.\nOur children came in 08 & 09 a boy & a girl. What a blessing in our lives they are. My ex seemed to really focus on our children the first few years but all of a sudden she just seemed like she couldn't handle the daily grind of working & helping raise our kids. Got to the point when kids were in first grade & pre-k i would have to come home & make sure she had the kids up & ready to get to school in time. Several times the kids would be up & playing & she was still asleep when i arrived. Keep in mind the kids were 5 & 6 at the time. Discussed this with her & she seemed like it was no big deal.\n\nAs years progressed her condition seemed to worsen. Just seemed like i was taking care of 3 kids. As i look back this is where the Parent Child Syndrome kicked in. Our marriage started failing around this time. I knew there was something wrong but just couldn't figure it out. I wanted to be the perfect husband & not complain about what was going on .\nWe kept on growing apart. She just seemed to want to party all the time with not much responsibility towards our kids. Anything that was monotonous or boring she didn't seem to want to have any part of.\nIn the fall of 2014 she ask for a separation. I was floored but not all that surprised. She told me she wanted to have fun & was not going to live her life based on my schedule. I went to counseling by myself a couple of times first. I talked her into going & she went. I later returned to counselor for third session & the counselor said i wasn't the problem in the marriage. We then had a few joint meetings between me my ex. & counselor. Don't know what was said between my ex. & counselor . My ex. would never tell me. We got along a little better for a couple of months then she called me requesting a divorce in spring of 2015.\nI then really started searching for answers to problems in our relationship. Searched the internet & our marital issues seemed to trace back to Adhd. My ex- told me when she was young her mom would tie her up in chairs sometimes to keep her still. Her father showed a lot of the same traits my ex does. She also told me that her grand mother had psychological issues being placed in straight jackets on a few occasions. She explained this to me earlier in our relationship. So when i subtly brought up her symptoms to her she stilled blamed me for our demise.\nWe ended up getting divorced Dec. of 2015. We have joint 50/50 custody of our children. Its been a hard road . My daughter cries each time we make the transfer on weekends. My son tends to keep his feelings inside. My ex wont get the kids to practices on time, has never showed up to my sons basketball games on time etc. Now just the other day my son ask me if i could pick him up from after school day care before his basketball game. I ask him why because its moms night to pick you up. He said that if i picked him up he wont have to worry about him being late & not running out on floor the same time as the other kids. Come to find out from him that is what happened the previous game.\nWhat, or is there anything i could do or any way help our situation at this point? Oh, by the way our son was diagnosed with Add 1 1/2 years ago & my ex- is still in denial.","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Ex-wife Adhd affecting our kids","resp_content":"Hi there,\n\nOh dear. You have definitely been getting whipped around on the ADHD Roller Coaster, haven't you?\n\nThe behavior you describe in your ex-wife is definitely on the more \"severe\" end of ADHD. But I've heard similar stories many, many MANY times over the years.\n\nIt's especially difficult for men, I think, because our society tends to tolerate women complaining about their husband not \"being there\" for the kids, missing event and practices, etc. But if a man criticizes his wife in this department? He is too often seen as a chauvinist pig. It can be very lonely.\n\n\"Denial\" is a very real phenomenon with ADHD. Not for everyone but for many. (Nothing about ADHD is true for everyone; it is a highly variable syndrome.)\n\nIt might help if you learned about the nature of this denial.\n\nSometimes the denial comes due to ignorance about the positive changes that treatment can bring. Sometimes the person simply does not want to become more responsible. \"Fun\" is the only goal.\n\nBut for some, denial springs from ADHD symptoms themselves. They simply aren't clearly observing themselves and their intereactions with the world.\n\nIf your son was diagnosed 1.5 years ago, I assume you have been learning about treatment and supportive strategies. Similar ones apply to adults with ADHD.\n\nIf you find there is no way she will consider treatment, you are stuck with trying to \"normalize\" life for the children. To have schedules, reliable pickups/drop-offs, routines at home, etc.\n\nIt definitely can be stress-inducing for any child, but epecially a child with ADHD, to be made late to school by a parent. Consistently. Especially if the parent doesn't seem to care.\n\nI wrote my first book as a \"support group in a book\" for the busy partners of adults with ADHD, especially those with children. http://amzn.to/2tmMRsC\n\nYou will probably find it very helpful, including in understanding your son's challenges.

I was prescribed Concerta, and it seemed to work good. Right about when I was 18 maybe a little sooner It was switched to a generic version because generics were approved or whatever the reason was so Insurance would only cover the generic. My dose was 36 mg of Concerta and it switched to something else not sure the name but it was only like 9 mg of something. I stopped taking it before my second 30 day prescription was up. It wasn't doing what it was originally. Looking back know the generics should be the same mg amount from looking online, which may have been part of the problem. Something else I noticed was in 2015 only the Actavis generic was approved as a substitute for Concerta it was previously three different generics approved.\n\nMy main question after all of that is can my general family doctor re-prescribe me a add medicine, without seeing a psychiatrists again. The first time I went to a the family doctor he sent me to a psychiatrist and then psychiatrist sent me back to him to prescribe the dosage or whatnot. I am paying for all of this out of pocket so i don't want to pay for 3 doctors visit if I can get it done in one by either going straight to the psychiatrist or my family doctor.\n\nSecond question is that concerning prices I looked up prices on good RX and the closest thing other than approved Concerta generic which is $116 for a 30 day supply is the Ritalin LA generic which is like $68 for 30 days. Would he be able to switch what I was taking to the Ritalin LA, It is essentially the same drug but last 6-8 hours vs 10 to 12 for the Concerta. Still not sure which way I would go if he gave me the option but the Ritalin is half the price so it wouldn't hurt to try it.\n\nIt has been almost 6 years since my last prescription was filed if that matters. I started college a year ago and managed to somewhat handle my add problems but the same thing is happening that did when I started High School - when I get too much on my plate at once I just cant focus on almost any of it. I in general have trouble focusing but can most of the time force myself too, but like I said when I get loaded down I don't react normal by doing one thing at a time I just cant really start or finish anything. I also lost a job last year in part because of that.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nWhen I get my tax return back in a week or two I am going to try to get back on it.

Sorry that it's so hard to navigate treatment. It's so unfair to make people who are already struggling with motivation, organization, and initiation to plow through all these obstacles.\n\n1. Generic Concerta\n\nI was the person who led the campaign to downgrade the inferior Concerta generics. People were being forced to accept them as generic substitutes for brand by their pharmacy-healthcare insurance benefit.\n\nLives were going off the rails.\n\nWe succeeded in downgrading those. But guess what? Three new generics have popped and are currently causing havoc. I wrote about it here: https://adhdrollercoaster.org/medication/7977/\n\n2. Who can prescribe?\n\nThat's strange, that the psychiatrist sent you back to your GP. Perhaps the psychiatrist was trying to save you money.\n\nAt any rate, writing stimulant prescription typically requires a special license. Stimulants are controlled substances (\"Schedule II\") and not every physician wants to bother with the paperwork.\n\nThis varies by state. In some states, even psychologists can prescribe. In others, nurse-practictioners.\n\nI'd just ask your GP point-blank....\"Can you prescribe this or not? I'm suffering heavy losses in my life, and I need help. If you cannot, can you refer me to a competent prescriber?\"\n\n3. Medication cost\n\nGoodRx only goes so far.\n\nIf you financially qualify, most of the stimulant manufacturers have assistance programs. Check the website for whichever medicatiton (e.g. Concerta, Vyvanse, etc.). You can download forms that your prescribing physician will need to sign.\n\nSome of the newer stimulant formulations (e.g. Evekeo, Aptensio, etc.) have huge savings programs, where the first prescription is basically free (maybe $3) or very low cost. Just check the websites.\n\nThe newer medications have to compete for market share already held by the older medications.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.\n\nGood luck and keep persevring. You deserve help.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/39477/getting-re-prescribed-add-medication"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Adderall xr 20mg","post_content":"I am 21 and I have recently been prescribed adderall 20mg xr.

They've heard somewhere that Adderall is most effective (not true), and they go with that.\n\nDespite it being highlyl abuseable.\nDespite it having a relatively high side effect profile.\nDespite the entire class of amphetamine stimulants not being useful to a large number of poeple with ADHD.\n\nIt's really annoying that people with ADHD have to manage their own care and second-guess their prescribers. But it's necessary if you want to have the best outcomes.\n\nIn brief, there are two classes of stimulants:\n\n1. Methylphenidate (e.g. Concerta, Ritalin, Focalin, Quillivant, Daytrana, and the newish offering Aptensio, etc).\n\n2. Amphetamine (e.g. Dexedrine, Adderall, Adderall XR, Vyvanse, and the newish offering Evekeo, etc.)\n\nIn general, 40 percent of people with ADHD will respond better to one class than the other. So it's very important to try both classes.\n\nEven within the same class, it's good to try at least a couple of different offerings.\n\nFor example, even though Methylphenidate is the active medication in all of that first class, the delivery system can make a huge difference for the individual.\n\nIn the end, Adderall MIGHT end up working the best for you. But I find it a very problematic choice for beginning treatment.\n\nhttps://adhdrollercoaster.org/adhd-news-and-research/the-tragic-truth-of-adderal-or-madderall/\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGina\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/36036/adderall-xr-20mg"},{"post":{"author":"smonfils","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Adderall and ADHD in adults","post_content":"Hello, I'm a 52 yr old mom of 1, grandma of 3 and just want to tell others that there IS help for adults w/ ADHD.

I am 30, a FT (returning) student and FT manager and am feeling overwhelmed in my last semester before graduation. I have been throwing up when I wake up on busy days for nearly a year. I have panic attacks about twice a month which numb my face and blur my hearing. I believe that most of my anxiety is related to untreated ADD. My parents did not believe in it and ignored and were insulted by teacher conferences where it was discussed. I struggled to graduate highschool, but moved away from a chaotic situation and began community college, where I began using marijuana to focus. Suddenly, I was on the deans list, I have self-medicated this way since. Since I have a high gpa and no need for academic accommodation, my councilor sent me to the nurse she didn't feel the need to investigate add. The RN prescribed celexa, which has stopped the panic attacks and vomiting. With graduation approaching, I feel that the only way I can quit marijuana use and obtain a next-level position is by properly treating my ADD. I have quit pot multiple times for 2 months or so and I show up to work on my days off, lose my phone in the freezer/linen cabinent/street, and perform substantially lower on tests. So now what? How does a grown woman reach out for help with ADD? Oh and I don't have a family DR., I usually go 1-3 years between trips to urgent care, which is why I went to the medical center at school.

It's expected to constantly go through a lot of them within a certain time limit, and then to do an assignment. But, I'm having the hardest time just sitting down and reading through a book.

Can Sudafed, Minoxidil and Calcium heartburn pills cause high BP and heart rate???","post_content":"Hi,\n\nYesterday, 12/28/17, I had a drug interaction. I was cleaning my wood pellet stove and during the process I noticed I was sweating and my heart was racing. I sat down in front of my clock and checked my heart rate, it was 162 BPM!\n\nI had a doctor's appointment that day anyway, so I took a shower and got dressed to go to my orthopedic. I felt a little off while I was in the office and spent like I ran a marathon. When the nurse put the finger heart rate monitor on I noticed my heart was still running between 115 and 120. My BP was 140/110 also high. I think something I put into my body yesterday interacted with my prescription meds.\n\nI said something to the nurse when I saw my heart rate, she said to speak to the doctor about it.\n\nI started using Minoxidil 5% Wednesday to help thicken one side of my beard and assumed that maybe it was interacting with my meds because it was only my second day taking it. I checked for drug interactions and didn't see any between it and my meds when I started using it. The doctor told me that Minoxidil shouldn't cause this condition. The minoxidil box says Minoxidil can cause your heart to race. I googled minoxidil interactions and found several people who claim they had interactions immediately after using it.\n\nI went home, alerted my psychiatric nurse and then took to the internet to try to find some answers.\n\nMy heart rate and BP came back down last evening.\n\nI found several things that could have caused a problem and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on the issue.\n\nI take three prescription drugs daily\n\n10mg ritalin 3x daily for ADHD (just started taking in May)\n100mg Zoloft 1 x daily for PTSD\n100mg Seroquel 1x daily for insomnia\n\nI went untreated for years and began to suffer extreme anxiety and depression, so I saw a doctor last November. Ultimately I was diagnosed as ADHD and PTSD. I've had sleeping problems since I hit puberty, it's genetic on my mother's side of the family so I addressed that too.\n\nI also have SIBO, small intestine bacteria over production. I'm on a low FODMAP diet, and mostly use aloe vera gel and occasionally use calcium pills to control heart burn.\n\nWhen I started taking these meds I was 20 pounds lighter. My resting blood pressure was 107/70 and my resting heart rate was about 55-60.\n\nI started smoking again last year, then I injured my right forearm so I stopped working out on top of it all. My blood pressure has steadily climbed. At my last visit to my Psychiatric nurse WEDNESDAY this week my BP was 128/80 and my heart rate was 60 BPM.\n\nI asked my nurse if she thought the Ritalin was causing my BP to rise, she said it's the smoking and lack of exercise. I quit smoking tobacco a month ago, and switched to an e-cig, I'm down to 3MG of nicotine, next step is 0 so I'm dealing with that. As soon as my arm is 100% I'll return to the gym too.\n\nOn Christmas Eve my wife made a beautiful spread of food I shoudn't eat, but I did anyway. On top of that I did some drinking, vodka, club soda and OJ over the weekend and through Wednesday night. My heartburn was out of control from Christmas eve and is just starting to subside right now so I've been taking more calcium pills to help control the heartburn.\n\nI found an article that said Calcium pills can raise the PH level in your stomach which can cause Ritalin to absorb more into your blood stream.\n\nI found another article that said Minoxidil can cause a racing heart rate because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. The article said that your heart will race to bring your blood pressure back up, but no data to confirm that hypothesis.\n\nI've also got a cold, I've been taking a generic Sudafed 12 hour for a week or so too. I found that the Sudafed I was taking can interact with Ritalin, but again no data to confirm. By the way it's real Sudafed, not the PE. And for the record I took some Sudafed this spring and didn't notice any problems, but I was 20 lbs lighter and in better shape.\n\nDid I mix a dangerous concoction of Ritalin, Sudafed, Calcium pills?\n\nI didn't take Ritalin, minoxidil or Sudafed today.\n\nI'm gonna just deal with the cold, and would love someone to weigh in on what could have caused this issue.\n\nThat's all I've got.

Now i was taking that medication daily Monday thru Friday and sometimes on occasion on the weekend.

That's highly, highly unusual. Are you sure you have that right?\n\nIn any case, ADHD can be severe, even at young ages. And the decision to medicateis made in order to protect the child from common risks such as running out in the street or being \"curious\" about toxic household cleaners, playing with matches, etc.\n\nSo, if you were given medication at that young age, chances are good that your symptoms were very significant.\n\nGiven that most children with ADHD do NOT outgrow symptoms, it makes more sense to attribute your current problems to untreated ADHD rather than lingering effects of the stimulant.\n\nThat said, Adderall is NOT my favorite stimulant. In fact, it's my least favorite. For a variety of reasons.\n\nThere are better options now, and you owe it to yourself to talk to a competent psychiatric specialist. Especially one who can tease out any co-existing condition you might have. About 75% of adults with ADHD have a second, co-existing condition (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, etc.).\n\nI would encourage you, though, to keep educating yourself on the topic, so you can recognize who is a competent specialist -- and who is not.\n\nI can give you a hint. Any MD whose first suggesting is prescribing Adderall is NOT competent.\n\nThis is one of my most popular blog posts, and I've been writing aboutt he pitfalls of Adderall for many years. It can help you understand a rational approach to medication treatment for ADHD+\n\nhttps://wp.me/p5Ilzb-Kx\n\nFinally, dosage really varies. Back when you were a child and now. It depends on a person's neurochemistry. Some require small doses, some very large.\n\nSometimes children receive higher doses because their young bodies actually metabolize the drug faster than adults.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"},{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: ADHD Long Term Side Effects","resp_content":"P.S.

I also daydream uncontrollably- sometimes to the extent of wasting 2-3 hours in one time doing so. In around 5thgrade, I would regularly sleep at around 12 am doing homework because I just could not focus. I would also keep bugging my friends to teach me what the teacher just taught because I could not focus on what the teacher was saying during his teaching. Then middle school came and the homework load doubled causing me to sleep on average at 1 am. The high school started along with volunteer and work and I began to sleep at 2-3 am. However, things have just spiraled out of my control this year. I am taking 6 AP classes right now along with 3 volunteer events per week along with work from 3-10 after school on Fridays. This is causing me to sleep at around 3-5 regularly- while waking up at 6:45. I really feel like I can't do this anymore. Homework is taking way too long to finish (I usually take much more time completing classwork that the rest of my classmates) and studying is just too hard because I always end up daydreaming- even when I have an exam the next day. My parents have always been academically strict so I have always maintained straight A's including this semester... so far. I just don't know how I am going to continue this with my terrible concentration and my inability to process information quickly. I wanted to let my parents know about my problems and to ask to find a psychologist who can tell me if I have ADD or ADHD or not but my parents don't really believe in ADHD. I've told my mother once but she told me that everything was just mentality and that I just need to have more willpower to get things done. But I know that that's not true. I'm struggling- not with the courses or even my schedule but that fact that I just don't have control over them. I wanted to get your input on what you think of my case. In your personal opinion, do you think I may have ADD or ADHD? Do/did you face similar problems as I have and still am? If you do see similarities between your case and mine, how do you think I should approach my parent to let me talk to a professional? I know this isn't in any way a diagnosis place but I wanted to get some input from first-hand people who have ADHD/ADD.","like_count":"1","tags":["ADHD in Children","Living With","Symptoms","Treatment & Care","Diagnosis","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[{"author":"werisebyliftingothers","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Please help.","resp_content":"I don't think there's a way that anyone here can tell you what mental illness you have.\nMy sister is in high school and struggles very similar & our father refuses to get her help.

And my mom didn't want to be the mom with the kid with ADD. I forced myself to cut back on AP classes. Social events. Talk to your guidance counselor about what you can do to cut back on things and still have a good college resume. Overloading yourself will make your anxiety worse and that can lead to depression and I wish more people would acknowledge the importance of mental health, especially when you so bravely went to your parents about it. In college, you can pick your classes. And you'd need to look into this, but even under your parents insurance at 18, you can find doctors and go on your own. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I was in the same boat and became very impulsive. You have to cut back on some things, for your wellbeing. Even as an adult, I have to take a step back sometimes because it's too much and I feel like my nerves are going to explode. Like I said, talk to your guidance counselor about what classes you can and can't take and still have a good college resume (I was able to do this without my mom knowing.. she didn't really pay attention but idk how your parents look at your report cards) but honestly, they can't MAKE you take a class.

In high school.. parents need to be involved. And in this situation, if they are good parents, the fight is worthless. But you can cut it down to one volunteer session a week. Fewer APs. Working less. Also, try to find coping mechanisms. To help organize. I have lists upon lists. My phone is my life. Alarms for everything. Because I either lose focus, or become so focused on something that nothing else matters. I'm rooting for you. I was there. Now I'm 29 and still kind of unfocused but have a diagnosis and know my boundaries. Start there. Slow things down. Get a system. Figure out your boundaries. And stay strong because this part of your life passes and the one good thing about ADD is that when we can shift our focus onto something we generally love and are passionate about as you get older, it becomes easier to manage all of this.\n"},{"author":"kees74","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Please help.","resp_content":"Get some sleep would you.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/30565/please-help"},{"post":{"author":"bamawilson1","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Adderall scary side effect??

In the past 6 years I have been to 3 different (GP) doctors and asked each to schedule testing for ADD for me. The 1st told me I was just too busy in life. The 2nd (about 2 years later) told me he didn't believe in that dx. The 3rd (approximately 1&1/2 years ago) told me we would address it later. The 3rd Dr was part of the same network of Drs the 1st is part of. When I went in for a second visit with Dr3 I spoke with them about getting testing done. There were 0 notes on my chart even noting that I felt this needs to be addressed. How does one get treatment it they cant get tested? And how does one get tested if no one will even discuss it with me, much less write orders for the testing? It is SO frustrating and has seriously ruined the trust I have in medical doctors. My mother was a life long educator and says that while ADD wasn't something that was even a \"thing\" when I was growing up, theres no doubt in her mind that I was the poster child for it.\nIf this is standard treatment of Drs towards patients then I can pinpoint where a lot of our heroin and drug problems stem from. If a Dr won't take care of a problem people will self medicate. (Not that I'd go to that extreme. I have a home and family that I would never jeopardize. But I clearly see why people do.)\nI'm at my wit's end and starting to spiral into depression. I've never asked any Dr for an Rx, only to be tested so we can go from there.\n\nHow do I get to that point?\n\nThanks :)","like_count":"1","tags":["Treatment & Care","Diagnosis","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[{"author":"klee029","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: How to get tested/dx for ADD","resp_content":"What prompted you to want to go through the diagnostic process? The reason I ask is because I have ADD inattentive type, among other things, and was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder until 29, when my son was diagnosed as ADHD. Then, as I took him to our same group doctor, I started to look over the symptoms and bipolar disorder just didn't make sense. So I asked the psychiatrist (whom I came to when my anxiety rose to an all time high after my father passed) and he profusely apologized for not seeing it sooner. He specialized in adolescents with ADD, which is now considered a spectrum disorder but a lot of doctors aren't latching onto that yet. And, it's proven that parents with ADD typical don't notice the signs of it on their children (my son was 11 at the time) because it's all normal behavior to us. I looked into it for him because my once straight A student started middle school and the behavior problems started, anxiety, grades dropped, etc.\n\nMy point is, is there a catalyst? It could help to find a Dr. That specializes in this. Or if there's a family history, that could help sway a doctor to move on it. ADHD can hide within so many things, it can be hard to diagnose as an adult. However, I'd had these symptoms since I was around 6 years old and it's been a lifetime struggle until I found the right medication.\n\nI'm not a doctor, but I've been to almost 20 over my tiny 29 years, just for myself. So I do a lot of research and I leave doctors instantly if I'm not getting the care I need. It's a GRUELING process but I might have some advice for you. Let me know!

Best of luck!\n"},{"author":"justtryingmybest","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Need feedback please","resp_content":"Hi danamay,\n\nI just joined here and saw your post. I share your concern since I really mistrust drugs, almost as much as I distrust the companies themselves, a couple of which I used to work for. To reassure you, your concerns are reasonable and very justified. I am going to share my experience with these drugs and let you draw your own conclusions.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago I was prescribed Concerta. I started on the lowest dose (18 mg) and immediately felt the benefits of being able to concentrate better. It did not really impact my sleep too much, and by reading before bed it really tired my brain and helped me nod off. The one side effect I was hoping for, appetite suppression, unfortunately never occurred in me. I somehow gained weight. But overall, it helped.\n\nMy psychiatrist raised the dose after a while (27 mg) and I noticed a bigger difference. Yes, I was able to really regulate my focus better at work, but I also had more trouble winding down and going to sleep at night. By Friday I felt like a coke addict that I would see in movies. But still, my appetite was as good as ever. So I used the higher dose during the week when concentrating was really important, and used the lower dose on the weekends, or even got off of it altogether just to clear the system. I know they say not to do that, but it helped me.\n\nI was prescribed an even higher dose later on (36 mg), but I only took that once or twice. I found that taking that made me so alert after midnight that I was ready to run a marathon while doing advanced math in my head. Of course, the next morning I was ready to sleep through my alarm and felt like a jittery zombie all next day. It turns out that I am highly susceptible to the drug so I don't really need a high dose.\n\nMy son also has ADHD, and he is on much higher doses (72 mg). I also don't like how it changes his personality, but he swears by it and he says it helps him get his great marks. He also goes on lower doses over the weekend, and gets off of the medication completely during school holidays. Who am I to argue with success and with what he finds helpful? I support it and tolerate the negative side effects, but also continuously monitor it.\n\nNow for some news that you may really like. After being on Concerta for a few years I found that my sleep started getting disrupted more and more. It turns out that is not to do with the drug, but with the process of ageing. As you get older your sleep patterns just change. Concerta just exacerbates this natural process. So I went on Ritalin which I could take in the morning and then at lunch, and whose side effects would wear off by the evening. That worked, and then I found I could just get by on the morning dose. That is partly because of my susceptibility to the drug, but also because I put some good structures in place to help me live with ADHD. Eventually I was able to go off Ritalin completely. I now function well without drugs. I work in a high pressure environment and am thriving.\n\nMy son's psychiatrist explained it all to me. She is really good. She said that as a teen, as your brain is developing, you need to go on high doses, but as you get older you can begin reducing the amount of medication you take. Your body will let you know this as it did for me. Eventually you may not need it at all.\n\nHowever, there is another thing to make sure you do. I am sure you heard by now that medication is not a silver bullet, and that is really true for me. I found that medication allowed me to take action to make changes that allowed me to live more easily with my ADHD, but that's all. The biggest benefit I received was from using an ADHD coach as well as books that helped me organise my life in a way that were ADHD friendly. I also entered therapy to help me deal with growing up with the negative repercussions of being different. I would strongly encourage you to do that, especially the ADD coach, in addition to your medication, if you decide to go that route.\n\nI hope this helps you.\n1\n"},{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"I know you are answering, not asking a question, but I felt it important to respond. I hope you don't mind.","resp_content":"\nYour problems with sleep might have more to do with co-existing depression/anxiety, which can be exacerbated by the stimulants.\n\nMany people with ADHD will need both a stimulant and a medication for the depression/anxiety.\n\nYour MD shoudl have told you this. I'm not fully in agreement with her explanation about aging and dosage. It does jibe with proper prescribing practice for ADHD.\n\nI am also concerned about your son using stimulants as a \"performance drug.\" This can create problems over time.\n\nThe idea with ADHD treatment is that it is the same every day, to promote balance in life. Not to spike during the week and don't take on the weekends, etc. That creates a real \"roller coaster\" of neurotransmitters in the brain. No ADHD expert would recommend this.\n\nBest,\nGina Pera\n1\nReply\nspiritualardent\nover 2 years ago\n@justtryingmybest thank you so much for your post. Very informative and encouraging!\n"},{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Need feedback please","resp_content":"Hi there,\n\nYour fears are justified. I worry more about people who take these medications casually.\n\nBut just remember....trying a stimulant again is not like cutting off a leg. You can always stop.\n\nWhy do you fear addiction? Have you had problems with substance abuse? Many people with ADHD find that their \"addictive cravings\"diminish once they start stimulant medication.\n\nAlso, ADHD itself can make a person more prone to reacting out of fear -- and less from rational thought. Because ADHD itself makes rational thought difficult.\n\nOne reason for your \"zombie-like\" appearance as a child on Ritalin might be that the dosage was too high.\n\nI would prefer that, as you try stimulants again, you not start with an extended-release choice like Concerta. I'd rather you start with a quick-release, shorter-acting choice, such as Ritalin or Focalin.\n\nBy the way, Concerta contains the same medication as Ritalin (and only slightly different than Focalin). It's just delivered to the system differently.\n\nI usually recommend the long-acting stimulants, for more continuous coverage without the ups and downs of taking multiple pills throughout the day.\n\nBut when you're just starting out, you might feel better trying a medication that isn't likely to last 6-12 hours.\n\nI particularly like Daytrana, the patch, for this purpose. It gives you more feeling of control. If you don't like the effect, just pull off the patch. The medication is, again, the same as that in Ritalin and Concerta.\n\nTake it one small step at a time, increase dosage slowly, and pay attention to how you feel. The doc should be doing this, but alas, some do not.\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck!\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"},{"author":"jk1026","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Need feedback please","resp_content":"I took Concerta for 7 years and the only thing I have to say is get checked often, I had ato have my dosed uped 4 times because i became used to it, insomnia is normal try taking a Walmart sleep aid from equate half an hour before bed, dont worry about addiction and just make sure you eat before you take it.

I will post more in a separate response.\n"},{"author":"Expert - Gina Pera","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: ADHD","resp_content":"HI there,\n\nJust to make sure I understand your question, these are the details:\n\n1. You have for the past year been taking the generic version of Adderall,\namphetamine salts XR.\n\n2. Earlier in life, you took the brand Adderall and didn't like the side effects. The generic seems to not have the same side effects (but also not the same effectiveness)\n\n3. Now you report that your last prescription has been filled with the brand Adderall, instead of the generic you've been taking. As a result, you are feeling:\n\n--more moodiness\n--more adverse effects on sleep\n--but also more help in mitigating symptoms.\n\n4. You want to know if you're the only one experience differing responses from brand vs. generic.\n\nDid I get all that right?\n\nHere is my response:\n\nBrand and generic medications are NOT the same. PERIOD.\n\nI wrote a blog post to explain this commonly asked question:\n\nhttps://adhdrollercoaster.org/tools-and-strategies/consumer-qa-on-concerta-and-generics/\n\nHere is an excerpt:\n\nHere are two key differences between brand and generics:\n\n1. Variable dose of effective ingredient:\n\nBioequivalence does not mean true generics are exactly the same as brand. In the U.S., the FDA requires the bioequivalence for the generic product to be between 80% and 125% of the original product. Yes, that’s roughly 20 percent up or down—a huge window of variance.\n\nThis variability alone can wreak havoc for the many people with ADHD. They might do best with a specific dosage; taking much more or less than that dosage is not as effective—and can even be very problematic. Especially when you’re not expecting it. And especially when you question the pharmacy about the different-looking pill and you’re told that generics are the exact same as brand. Wrong.\n\nFor example, you and your prescribing physician have established that 30 mg of medication X is best for you. You’ve tried 40 mg and 20 mg, both to poor effect. It is 30 mg!\n\nGiven this allowed ”bioequivalence” generic range of 80 to 125 percent, your generic pill could be anywhere from 24 mg to 37.5. Even that number will not be constant; it might vary each time the prescription is filled, because pharmacies often switcher suppliers.\n\n2. Different dyes, fill material, and binding\n\nMoreover, branded drugs and their true generics almost always contain different dyes, fillers, and binders. These are all ingredients to which many people are allergic or have other adverse reactions. (I cannot cite research to support it, but abundant anecdotal reports indicate that people with ADHD might be more prone to these sensitivities.)\n\nImagine when your physician has no clue that the filler is the problem, not the medication—and not some additional condition, such as bi-polar disorder.\n\n______\nNow, you say you are in Paris, where you cannot get a different prescription.\n\n(That might not entirely be true. ADHD treatment is very difficult to find in France, but I'm sure it's possible in Paris, if you have the cash. I don't know what medications are available there, though. France is one of the more backward European countries when it comes to ADHD.)\n\nYou absolutely cannot continue with this pattern of sleep deprivation. That is dangerous and surely will not help your ADHD symptoms.\n\nYou could try a lower dose of your brand Adderall and take it earlier in the day.\n\nDon't consume caffeine or tobacco.\n\nAvoid using electronics in the evening.\n\nGet exercise to help deal with anxiety.\n\nIdeally, you should be given trials of other options in stimulant. (There are many more now than when you were younger.) And you should be screened for co-existing anxiety and/or depression, both of which can be intensified by stimulants if not also managed with medication.\n\nGood luck!\nGina Pera\n"},{"author":"tnsanders","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you Gina! That was very helpful. As far as my adderall goes now, I've been trying to wake up around 5am and take it. Then I lay back down to sleep for a few more hours. That way it can be out of my system earlier in the evenings. I have been taking melatonin as well so I have been sleeping better. I will say I have noticed a huge difference in my personality though..I am very antisocial towards my classmates at school. So much so, that they have all asked me about it when they barely know me. Does this mean I need to be on a lower dose when I go home?","resp_content":"\nYes I am in France now, and I have seen a doctor here. You are right, Europeans think ADHD is nonexistent. He basically told me that \"people here don't take that they just get over it\" or something along those lines. Which is frustrating when you deal with it forever. He says that I can make another appointment and he will put me on Ritalin. Do you have any advice on switching to that? I think I've tried that one when I was really young but obviously I didn't stay on it long until we decided on adderall. I don't remember it.\nReply\nExpert - Gina Pera\nover 2 years ago\nHi,\n\nI'm glad my response was helpful.\n\nYes, definitely, Adderall can create personality changes. I learned about this 20 years ago, with my own husband. I thought, \"Is this the treatment? Seriously?\"\n\nThen I started a support group for the partners of adults with ADHD, to see if they were having similar experiences. They were. There's a reason I call it Adderall.\n\nThus my advocacy was launched.\n\nA primary reason for writing my first book was to help people get better results from medication. The MDs just weren't paying attention! Some still aren't.\n\nNo one can predict if a person with ADHD will do better on an amphetamine stimulant (Vyvanse, Adderall, Dexedrine) or a methylphenidate stimulant (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta, etc.). It's all down to neurogenetics.\n\nThat's why a person should be given a trial of each.\n\nIt would be worth your while to read my first book's chapter on medication. It's simply not available anywhere else. http://amzn.to/2y6EKlF\n\nSo, the answer is, MAYBE Ritalin will work better for you. You should give it a try.\n\nEven though you tried it as a child, who knows what the dose was, how they were measuring efficacy, etc. Sometimes, it's little more than \"throwing spaghetti at the wall.\" Not methodical. Random.\n\nIt still might be that you have co-existing depression/anxiety (quite apart from ADHD fallout), and that should be treated medically as well.\n\nBut first things first. Try the Ritalin and see. Start low, increase slowly.\n\nWhile you're waiting for that, try a lower dosage of the Adderall. If you can split the pill with a knife, etc.\n\nBonne chance!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/26023/adhd"},{"post":{"author":"tnsanders","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"ADHD","post_content":"I am looking for advice on the difference between Adderall X-r and amphetamine salts XR.

My son has something similar, anxiety combined with difficulty in make instant changes. He hates surprises of any kind, not just fire drills. After a while he is fine too, but initially it's really scary or frustrating for him.\n\nAs with him, there is not much you can do yourself. It's more the responsibility of the adults in your school who need to make some changes to your environment, at least a little bit. Here is what needs to happen.\n\nFirst of all, the school administration and your teachers need to know and understand that this is your situation and is serious enough.\n\nSecond, they should be able to let you know ahead of time, maybe even secretly, that a fire drill is about to happen and the alarm will go off. That will at least prepare you ahead of time. And I am betting that this would help you cope better. They should know that if a real fire happened and the drill went off you would be able to react properly. As you said, you're OK afterwards. So, it's not like your going to burn up in a fire because of your condition. You just need help in dealing with the drills. Right?\n\nI would suggest you talk to one of your teachers about it first. Pick one that seems the most nice to you. Tell her of him about it after class. Just tell them its private and they will make sure nobody hangs around listening.\n\nThen ask them how you should tell your other teachers and your school principal. They will probably be able to give you some advice. Also ask them if they could help you. Maybe they can talk to the other teachers and the principal on your behalf. I suspect you feel a bit shy because you don't want to look different and have people in your school make fun of you. Your classmates don't need to even find out. This should be just between you and your teachers. Plus, lots of kids have something anyways. Some have allergies, some have disabilities, so everyone needs to be accepted. You do too.\n\nI hope this helps.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/23855/fire-drill-anxiety"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"A Closer Look at E-Therapy","post_content":"E-therapy is a great option when you can't afford a traditional therapist, you feel uncomfortable discussing certain issues in person, or you can't find qualified help in your area.\n\nHow does e-therapy work?

There is a bunch of information available for you: web sites, organizations (I like CHADD personally), and books and magazines, not to mention computer programs and apps. If you have Facebook, search for pages and groups for parents of kids with ADHD (I just checked and there are a bunch). Groups are particularly nice because you can ask questions and at least someone will have had a similar experience. Of course, none of that should take the place of your daughter's mental health team: doctor and counselor or therapist.\n\nGood luck, and don't worry!

I am 16, going on 17, and I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 5 years old. My mother has it and my grandfather on her side does too. My mother has a more concentrated form of it, but there are a lot of things she doesn't understand when it comes to mine when I try to explain. I was wondering if what I notice is still ADHD or if it is something else. I've tried looking it up, but you know the internet. Type in any symptoms and it turns out I have cancer and 53 other diseases. I was diagnosed with Seasonal Depressive Disorder last year, but I don't feel depressed right now. I don't feel the same as I do when I am depressed. What's going on has been happening for most of my life. I always have a hard time remembering something or sticking to any routine. Even if I've been doing something for months on end, I will at some point stop, but not on purpose. It's more like I stop doing whatever it is without noticing and form a new routine that isn't helping me. I have huge gaps in my memory of important things and I can't remember much from my childhood, but when I do remember things, they are very trivial. I will remember exactly what someone was wearing the day of my 10th birthday, but I can't remember any thing that happened last year at school or what important thing someone said to me last week. I have very low motivation to do anything, even though I *know* I need to do it. Time passes me by, three hours will go by and I feel like it's been one hour. I feel like I do everything on autopilot, but I'm still very aware of what is going on around me. I can't focus, even when I take my Ritalin. I feel like I don't have the same range of emotions as everyone else. I've tried bringing that up with my mother but she says that if I was apathetic then I wouldn't be worried about it. I don't get sad about things I should get sad about and I tend to get more angry about things than normal. I'm not violent, but I have felt the need to be more aggressive about things, although I never have because I know that's not how one is supposed to react. I compulsively lie about things that are trivial and have no importance to anything. I don't lie with an end goal or for some purpose, I just say something false and afterwards I usually ask myself why I did. there's no point to it and I don't get anything out of it. I don't know if these are all because of ADHD or something else. Maybe I'm just a bad person? Please give me your thoughts.\nSide note: I don't think it's because I was raised a certain way. My mom definitely has tried to change these things, but she seems to think they are deliberate actions on my part. Nothing is on purpose, I just don't notice it. Also I'm not uneducated, I have IQ of 145, so none of this is from a lack of knowledge.","like_count":"1","tags":["ADHD in Children","Living With","Symptoms","Treatment & Care","Diagnosis","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[{"author":"midlandj","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: ADHD or Something Else?","resp_content":"First off, you don't sound like a bad person, so I'd encourage you to stop that thought when you find it creeping into your mind.

Any medication that does not increase your capacity to focus and sustain attention (feel sharper) is not working for you.\n\nWhat you should (must) do: Continue taking the med exactly as prescribed. At your next appointment with your doctor, explain in detail what is happening. Your post is an excellent example. You may want to print it and give it to your doctor to read.\n\nI am not a doctor but I'll share with you a few ideas that I think are solid.\n\nThe doctor and the patient form a partnership to improve the patient's health. Both partners have their responsibilities. The doctor's job is to prescribe meditations, other therapies and directives that will likely help the patient. The patient's responsibilities include reporting symptoms and problems as accurately and objectively as possible, then to follow the doctor's orders to a tee. IMHO when the partnership fails, especially with mental health problems, it is usually the patient's fault. But not always. If you conscientiously hold up your end of the bargain and do not see an improvement within 6 months, what I have done, and you may want to consider, is too find another doctor. In my case, it worked out very well to my benefit.\n\nI have been diagnosed with adult ADHD, GAD, and Depression NOS. I took two other steps that have proven beneficial. I got a complete physical workup. It turned up type 2 diabetes. The diet and exercise regimen they put me on has had a good effect on my overall physical and mental health. I also saw a psychologist for CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). Less the CBT, all my other efforts would have been nothing more than a complete waste of my time and money.\n\nCome to think of it, I also put in many hours educating myself on the things that ail me - time very well spent. My primary source is WebMD. You are in the right place.\n\nI took the time to give you as much as I can because I do not want you to go through what I went through. If knew what I know now when I was 28, my life would have turned out much differently. While I had a few brief moments of glory, I mostly careened from one disaster to another. 15 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and got the medical help that I all along really needed and my life improved dramatically. My hope is for you to experience the same, not at age 50, at age 28.

I, however, experienced a side of ADHD that is equally as impacting but not as often talked about which is frustrating. A lot of people might view hyperfocus as a good thing, and in some very rare and few cases it is. However, while I'm focusing so heavily on ONE thing for days, weeks and months, my entire world is falling apart around me. I've lost so many opportunities in life because of this. If only this hyperfocus could apply to my real life daily responsibilities then I would be ON FIRE. Is there a way?

You seem to have what we call \"insight\" -- the ability to see your behavior rather objectively.\n\nPeople with ADHD have this to varying degrees, some more and some less. I find that having more insight is always a good thing, because it means you're dealing with reality and are not \"in denial.\"\n\nYou also see the problem with the very widespread misinformation (and, in some cases, disinformation) about the alleged benefits of hyperfocus.\n\nYou acknowledge that while you were hyperfocusing, your world was falling down around you. You are able to connect the dots between action and consequence. Not everyone with Adult ADHD can do this. They might be more likely to blame other factors for the consequences of their hyperfocus. Or fail to see the consequences at all.\n\nIn truth, there are no benefits. Hyperfocus is a short way to say, \"Cannot control focus.\"\n\nADHD and hyperfocus is such a complex topic—made muddy by all the online nonsense— but I'll try to keep it simple here.\n\nADHD isn't really about an attention deficit. It's not even about \"finding focus.\" It's about having difficulty self-regulating. Regulating motivation. Regulating focus. Regulating food or substances. Regulating resistance to distractions. Regulating emotion, interest, stamina, goal-oriented behavior, etc.\n\nCompounding this: Folks with ADHD tend to have difficulty with transitions. Especially if the current activity is highly stimulating.\n\nWhen some people with ADHD are in the midst of \"hyperfocus,\" they find it grand! The dopamine is flowing. The rest of the world and it's challenges disappear while they are deep-diving into Wikipedia or whatever it is they are hyperfocusing upon.\n\nTo be high functioning in life, however, we need to manage our focus, not the other way around. We need to be able to consciously decide where to invest our energies, rather than allow them to be squandered by the interest of the moment.\n\nHere is a fantastic essay on the dangers of \"hyperfocus\" and how medication helped this person to regulate her focus. http://adhdrollercoaster.org/medication/adhd-drug-holiday-or-horror/\n\nWith the range of ADHD-related challenges, the best way to manage them is with evidence-based strategies. For many, that means medication. For everyone, that means implementing as many supportive strategies as possible to keep you on track. A reliable calendar and reminder system. A reliable way of managing a to-do list, etc.\n\nI hope this helps get you started!\n\nGina Pera\n2\n"},{"author":"spiritualardent","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you so much! @Gina Pera.","resp_content":"It is so hard to get help for ADD\nI am from Adelaide SA.\nI result appreciated your reply.\nI do much need to learn to focus!

First of all, good for you on getting help to improve your life! That takes a lot of courage. I had mental health (depression and anxiety) in my teens, and my family was no help at all. So I know how lonely that can be. I eventually found a good counselor and a good medication and I am doing great.\nIt is very hard when your family does not support you. It sounds like you have at least 1 friend who is supportive and understanding, so that's great. A lot of people are still very ignorant about mental health, unfortunately.\nIt may take time to figure out exactly which combination of issues you have the most success treating. For example, if you are prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, you may become more organized because you won't be constantly distracted by worries.\nOne thing I noticed was you said your psychiatrist diagnosed anxiety and depression, yet is prescribing stimulant medication for ADHD. I would get some clarification on why they are choosing a stimulant if they think anxiety is your main issue. It may make you feel worse, not better, if your anxiety is not treated.\nI highly recommend that you also find a counselor/therapist who you like and trust. Try a few if you need to. It is so helpful and important to have a supportive person who can be objective and help you sort through these issues, and will communicate with your psychiatrist on how the medications affect you. Just taking medication without also having therapy will not provide a long term solution.\n\nGood luck to you!

She puts out the pills I am suppose to take in a vile with a when-to-take-them note. I took 2 Tylenol #3 and as my wife was leaving I asked her 'please put out two of those codeine pills with a big note with the time I can take them.\" The instructions are \"take 2 every 4 to 6 hours if needed.\" About 3 hours after taking the first 2 pills, the pain hit the \"I can't take it any longer\" level. So I hopped into bed and laid there in agony for about an hour. I got up, went into the kitchen to take 2 more, when I noticed the time was 2:25. The big note said 2:30 PM. I sat there and stared at the digital clock waiting for it to flip over to 2:30, then I took the 2 pills and went back to bed. The next day, my wife asks me \"why didn't you take your pills yesterday.\" I asked \"which pills are you talking about.\" She said, \"your prescription Tylenol.\" I said \"I took them.\" She said, \"you couldn't have.\" I said, \"I positively, absolutely, with 100% certainty, took, those, pills.\" She asked, \"then why did I find them in the bowl when I got home.\"\nDo you get the moral of the story?

Then you will have legal rights to be treated fairly and they must follow the plan.\nHave you told your parents how the teachers are making you feel?

Look up a site called Wrightslaw and they have a lot of great information on your rights with a 504 plan.

Many people who suffer with adult ADHD are often misdiagnosed with symptoms arising primarily from undiagnosed and untreated ADHD. Some common diagnosis that can occur due to undiagnosed Adult ADHD are Depression, Anxiety, substance use disorders, mood disorders and or personality disorders often these diagnosis are not invalid or in fact co-morbid with ADHD the problem is that until your ADHD is diagnosed and treated properly you can continue on this diagnostic merry go round for along time and much unnecessary suffering and trouble can be avoided if you make sure properly assessed for Adult ADHD in the first place. ADHD in Adults is a lot more Common than once thought with up to 1/15 Adults meeting the diagnosistic criteria for Adult ADHD. Signs that you may have undiagnosed Adult ADHD are commonly problems with Substances use, impulsive and risky behaviours, trouble with the law, not able to fulfil your potential, a sense of constant boredom or feeling like you're different some how and can't seem to achieve what you would like too. Problems with employment, Feeling like your flawed or helpless, low self esteem, sleep problems, trouble starting and completing jobs or projects constantly changing what your doing yet never quite getting things done. This can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, frustration, agititaion and for the need to self medicate with alcohol and other drugs.

Should people with ADHD avoid alcohol?\n\nIt really depends on the individual. ADHD is only one aspect of personality, and it is a highly variable condition.\n\nThat said, consider the effect of untreated ADHD on driving: It is equivalent to driving after having three alcoholic drinks.\n\nIn other words, having ADHD is already a bit like \"being drunk.\" That is, self-regulation and decision-making is already diminished. Alcohol can further diminish that, leading to poor choices and increased accidents.\n\nAlso: Yes, it does appear that ADHD leaves a person more vulnerable to abusing substances and behaviors. By that I mean, a person with ADHD might drink more to alleviate anxiety, thus being more likely to develop an addiction. Or a person with ADHD might \"escape\" in other ways, such as with online activity or videogaming, having sex, shopping, driving fast.....you get the picture.\n\nWhen the brain is under-stimulated—which is a simple way of describing ADHD—the unconscious impulse is to seek stimulation.\n\nAlcohol is initially a stimulant. People with ADHD have told me that first drink clears their head and improves focus. But then it goes away and they keep chasing it with a second drink. And a third. And...\n\nIn other words,in attempting to find sufficient stimulation in their environments or through substances, folks with ADHD can over-do it. They get over-stimulated and sometimes addicted.\n\nI hope this helps to answer your question.\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/7298/adult-adhd-alcohol"},{"post":{"author":"myowncrone","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Older adult with ADD","post_content":"I am 59 and have suffered/struggled with procrastination, disorganization and racing thoughts since a child.

I will try to hit the highlights.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI've read that stopping Adderall can cause a large weight gain in children. So can stopping medication in the summer cause him to gain a lot of weight?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf a person with ADHD gains weight when not taking a stimulant (whether Adderall or any other stimulant), that might indicate they are not getting the brain signal that they are full, so to stop eating. Or they might be \"self-medicating\" with food (sugar acts as a stimulant, for example).\n\nADHD itself is associated with higher risk of obesity. So, when taken, the stimulant might be preventing obesity from developing.\n\nThen again, some people with ADHD lose weight on a stimulant, sometimes weight they cannot afford to lose. There are many reasons for this. One major reason is that the stimulant dose is too high or the person also has anxiety, which is not being treated. Fifty percent of children with ADHD have a second condition, often depression, anxiety, etc.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI know this medication usually leaves the body quickly, so you can usually start and stop it without too many issues. But I wasn't sure if kids have withdraw at this dosage.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, it's true, stimulant medication leaves the body quickly. But Adderall stays longer in the system than the other stimulants.\n\nKeep in mind: The stimulant is having an effect throughout the brain and the rest of your body. It's not just about \"concentration\" but also about the respiratory system, the cardiovascular system, etc. Dopamine (whose transmission is enhanced by the stimulants) has a pivotal role throughout the body.\n\nEven though we use the metaphor of \"eyeglasses for the brain,\" stopping a stimulant is not quite as simple as removing eyeglasses. The body can undergo quite an adjustment when stopping \"cold turkey.\"\n\nFirst, I would question the wisdom of taking your child off medication in the summer. The notion of a \"drug holiday\" is outdated and misguided. It is likely that that he will continue to have ADHD symptoms, perhaps less noticeable than the physical hyperactivity symptom but still of consequence.\n\nIf you are looking only at test performance, you might be missing some of his other ADHD-related challenges. Perhaps with social skills. Presumably he will continue to learn and read throughout the summer, too.\n\nIf you are intent on stopping the medication, after consulting with the prescribing MD, I would still do it gradually, lessening the dose by a small amount each day over about a week or two weeks. And being careful to note challenges that arise.\n\nGood luck,\nGina Pera\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/6661/child-weight-gain-from-stopping-adderall"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"What Do You Wish People Knew About ADHD?","post_content":"Passing along this article: http://wb.md/2n7eEtN.

No one, ADHD or not, can just have good intentions about meeting a goal. We all need to plan.\n\nYes, I know. Trouble with planning is an ADHD challenge, too. But nonetheless, it is your challenge to address. It's not a question of your boss \"understanding.\" It is a question of you \"owning\" your ADHD.\n\nYour boss has a job to do, and you have a job to do. Yours involves getting to work on time. That's the bottom line.\n\nFor many people with ADHD, medication will be the single most powerful tool in their tool box. It can help them become more aware of the passage of time and to be more successful with planning and follow-through.\n\nEven with medication, most people with ADHD will need to faithfully use a planner/calendar, set with as many alarms as needed to get the job done.\n\nI encourage you to learn more about treatment strategies. They can truly make your life easier and happier.\n\ngood luck!\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/4077/adhd-inconsistency"},{"post":{"author":"gagrrl","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Executive function coaching for a kid with ADHD","post_content":"My 9th-grade son has his first appointment with his executive function coach tomorrow!

Does this person come well-recommended from other parents? What is this person's training?\n\nUnfortunately, there are no solid standards around training and certifying such coaches. Sometimes the standards are set by the person selling the coach-training. This is a huge and unsavory problem with the field of coaching. Especially ADHD coaching.\n\nWhen we talk about Executive Functions, we are talking about the higher-order brain processes that help us to navigate life in a healthy and productive way. Coaching is not going to improve Executive Functions per se. But ADHD medications can improve those functions.\n\nWe all can use help in organizing our priorities, tasks, and \"stuff.\" And folks with ADHD especially benefit from such help. The chief problem for most people with ADHD is disorganization—around time, around priorities, around stuff, etc.\n\nSometimes a professional organizer can provide help. Sometimes a therapist is helpful, because there can be psychological resistance to developing and maintaining the habits.\n\nMuch depends on the individual. ADHD is not a cookie-cutter condition.

Now they're red af?","post_content":"So i got this \"friend\" who has been prescribed 20mg adderall ir tablets, once a day at noon ever since starting high school (though he doesn't take it everyday, just when he needs to). This friend decided to try and get high off his adderall, since hes smoked weed before many times. He took 3 tablets and crushed them up and snorted the first then the other two by halves, every 1/2 hour, to make sure he didn't take too much (he ain't THAT dumb). The thing is he didn't really feel all that high, he was still pretty much completely functional, he just felt kinda euphoric but only a very tiny tiny bit. he just knew it was time to stop because his eyes were dilated like hell. He didn't sleep that night. Then yesterday. He woke up perfectly fine, pupils where back to normal too. Then around 2 in the afternoon he had an anxiety attack. He hasn't had an anxiety attack, or even really anxiety that much (except for like tests and stuff but that's normal, right?), since junior year high school and he's a freshman in college rn which is why he stopped taking his lamotragine when the anxiety stopped and why he didn't think to bring it with me to college. But, he was in his room and his roommate (who's been a close friend since elementary school) too. His roommate helped him. Actually walking outside helped a lot. But he still had anxiety, just not severe, just constant and relentless. His heart wouldn't slow down even though he seemed calm. Finally his heart slowed down but he was still feeling a lot of anxiety. He decided to snort more adderall like the other night, like a giant idiot (which he now realizes), but his anxiety stopped and he seemed fine except for the hugely dilated pupils, which weren't too too noticeable. Then last night he noticed his eyes were getting red in the corners. Like real read. It didn't seem to be spreading so he went to bed. Didn't sleep though again. Then comes this morning where his eyes are not super red but pretty red on the outer side only of each eye and in the inside of the lower eyelid. Also his pupils were still dilated. Since he didn't have dilated pupils still the morning after that first night, he figure somethings wrong because he took the same amount of adderall as last time, 60mg total. So he looked up if adderall can do stuff to the eyes. Apparently, snorting adderall can damage the eyes. Sh*t. He also finds out that redness of the eyes and dilated pupils along with darkening around the eyes can mean chemical damage to the eyes. But it could aslo mean the adderall is still in his system for whatever reason and his eyes are bloodshot because of the insomnia. He freaked the f*ck out because around his eyes had always been slightly dark so he could tell if that was a symptom or not. He took an emergen-c, because he knows vitamin c in high doses can get help stop and get rid of the adderall still in your system quick, thus possibly avoiding continued eye damage if there was ever any. He swore to himself never to get high on adderall again and he asked his roommate to hold onto his adderall to make sure he definitely wont, even to stop the expected anxiety attack if this today is to follow the same schedule as yesterday. Now he is waiting to see if the pupils will shrink, but hes kinda obsessing rn just waiting and he doesnt want to call his parents to ask them to drop off the lamotragine because they would probably ask what happened and start getting worried since he hasn't had an attack in almost 2 years. Plus his pupils are f*cking moons and his parents would notice. Is there anything else he could to to help with the seemingly inevitable anxiety attack and do you think he should see a doctor about the eyes right away or wait to see if the pupils shrink, because he has no discomfort when moving his eyes, another common symptom of chemical eye damage, they just feel tired which is reasonable from being up 60 hours straight and still counting cuz it's day. What does he do? He's kinda sorta panicking rn which is starting to cause some anxiety.\n\nPS: He doesn't feel high in the slightest even though his pupils are dilated.","like_count":"0","tags":["Symptoms","Treatment & Care","Diagnosis","ADHD in Adults"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/4067/eyes-are-still-hella-dilated-from-the-adderall-high-now-they-re-red-af"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Questions about ADHD?

I understand how your diagnosis could have came as a shock. However, learning of your diagnosis can be a positive thing because now you can begin to treat your ADHD with the help of your doctors.\n\nDo you currently have a doctor? I think that confirming your ADHD diagnosis with a professional would be the first step in receiving proper treatment. A neurologist or psychiatrist can monitor your health and prescribe medication to treat ADHD.\n\nIt says here ( http://wb.md/2ku7rBK) to find a doctor who has experience treating older adults with ADHD because, \"As you get older, problems like stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are more common. Someone who works with people over 50 will keep an eye on possible problems.. He/she'll create a treatment plan that's tailored to your needs.\"\n\nThe article also says that \"A therapist or life coach can help you make positive changes in your day-to-day.

So, I'll address both.\n\n1. The website\n\nEven with a quick glance, I can see this is not a reputable site.\n\nOne of the FAQ questions is:\n\nIs there scientific research that supports this diet?\n\nAnd the answer on the website is: \"Yes. The ADHD elimination diet foundation is based off solid Research that has been gather from around the World.\"\n\nLook at the poor grammar, the misplaced capitalizations, etc.\n\nMost importantly, look at the non-answer. No specifics.\n\n2. elimination diet for ADHD\n\nThe research is spotty.\n\nThis excellent review paper by a highly respected ADHD expert (Joel Nigg, PhD) explores existing evidence.\n\nHe concludes that there is very little evidence of benefit for people with ADHD from an elimination diet. There MIGHT be evidence for a small subset of people with ADHD. More research is needed.\n\nYou might find the introduction to this paper very interesting. Some of it gets technical, but you can just skip over those parts. ;-)\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322780/\n\nMany people, ADHD or not, have sensitivity to certain foods. The most common offenders seem to be wheat, dairy, corn, and eggs. Some food dyes and flavors cause problems, too.\n\nSo, if a person with ADHD has the added complication of food sensitivity, it will benefit that person to eliminate that food.\n\nThat does NOT mean that food allergies/sensitivities CAUSE ADHD.\n\nA simple method is to try eliminating one food group at a time. Try it for two weeks or so. Then introduce it, and see how you feel.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGina Pera\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/3825/have-you-tried-the-adhd-elimination-diet"},{"post":{"author":"blainekitten","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"how could I have ignored this for so long !

Due to downsizing, I was laid off. Three weeks after the lay off I landed a manager position at a non-profit thrift store. I've never worked a day in retail in my life! I've been there a year and I love it! It's rewarding and keeps me busy!\n\nYou may want to reconsider a new career. After all the jobs I have had, being a machinist and now this job they seem to have fit me the best of keeping me active. As long as we keep a schedule, check the schedule, stay on task as best as possible, get organized, stay organized, and ask for help (when we need it)...we can conquer and live productive lives with ADHD :)\n\nGo to your doctor!!!!!

You can do this!!!!\n"},{"author":"pipcan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"people loose friends, some people are just not able to handle social iterations. everyone has there own way of socialising the reason school was hard for us so called adhd kids/adults is that we have an imagination now when your young you an imagine anything loose yourself in your own head. but because of school we have lost somewhat of that imagination. and been forced to fit into the so called reality basically had the life and spark that made us who we are. school is a dull boring and a place. have you been in a room and had someone tell you what you know and what you think. and the moment you get of track thinking of things wondering how, what, where, when this, that, then your told your not paying attention or misbehaving. you are not to discover anything yourself. like i never got long division the teacher would sit with me for a week trying to explain it to me i just could not get it. more the point i knew the answer and had my own way of working it out. but boy did that get me in trouble i was given no marks and detention and letters were sent to my parents all because i could do it the was i was shown. my teatchers dignosessed me and would not let me in school enless my parents put me on meds Ritalin it was i was one of the early people in the uk to be put on it. but you know what yes it calmed me down yes i just followed instructions but i tell you now i lost something. the spark the want to know more the thirst for adventure and the want to know more i was a zombie and you think that drug calmed me down and made school easy for the teacher to teach irreverent infomation regurgitated bollox go a little smoother but this night mare never ended when school did i was put oon it after now you think giving amphetamine to a child is a good idear for 5 years i was kept in this prison in my mind. even now i am unable to get though the days. i have resorted to using illegal amphetamine now i know what your thinking o my good a druggy but its not like that its like this if you when to a pub every day for 5 years and that pints felling lasting you 12 hours and you did everything you would normally do like watch tv read a book now have that taken from you now you go read a book or watch tv i guarantee you it would not feel the same you would think about it even crave it now say you were 10 you think 10 year olds cant get addicted you think a 10 year old dose not get a come down or even understand i remember when i would miss a dose and i would get really tired hungry and angry and misbehave no one knew i was coming down having withdraws i still get them even now the meds ruined my life now im a coder and if you knew the things i have coded you would be amazed i learned it by myself never read a book never watched a video or never was taught now if i never had this plague imagine what i could have done remember adhd is a lie a solution to dumb children down so they will shut up wont ask questions and will do as they are told. this is just your curiosity you live your personality this is who you are and its being taken volenterrly it may be to late for you to learn this now and act on it but you could save someone else please save someone adhd is lie","resp_content":""}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/1421/do-i-have-adhd-no-one-understands-so-maybe-someone-here-can-help-me"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Adhd","post_content":"Hello I'm 23 years old and I have adhd had it since I was 3 years old and it's seriously affecting my relationship just want to know what I can do to make it better so I doesn't have any strain on my relationship","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Adhd","resp_content":"Hi there and thanks for posting.\n\nIt's important to speak with a doctor or counselor about the problems in your relationship and how ADHD could be causing them.

While out I the wilderness on a field trip, he strayed away from the group and when found by his teacher he shared he was ready to go home and wanted to leave. The teacher attempted to get him back to the camp site while the others were off on a nature walk. He became irritated and began to pick up rocks as a means to scare her. Each time he throw them, they would be off to the side. She explained he did not intend to hit her. Once one was thrown, he'd go for another and each time they got bigger. She explained she would inform him that he could hurt her and eventually stated he could kill her. She became scared enough to break out in a cry. He immediately turned off his behaviour and followed her to site. While there and before leaving, various adults approached him to talk and his response was swearing and demanding to return home.\nWhen I picked him up that day, I knew things didn't go well. He was visibly sad, withdrawn and angry. He shared wanting to return home and stated he had gotten mad. When I asked if he hurt someone, he stated he threatened his teacher with a rock, but wasn't going to hit her.\nThe school wants to have a restorative practice circle to discuss the incident and work through the trauma. I have explained this approach would not be successful as he is not built to talk about feeling openly as they expect and he will automatically come to the defence (fight or flight). I feel this is more adult focused then child focus.\nSince the beginning of the year, he hasn't really attended and the days he has there has been some sort of difficulty. More days than none anyway.\nThe night following his incident with the teacher, he refused to talk about it and when I would approach him his eyes immediately filled with tears. That night he tossed and turned and had three panic attacks; finally falling asleep at 5am. The second night the same, but without the panic attacks.\nThis week, he also got ahold of my visa and made approx. $300 in charges. When I approached him, he knew he was at fault and the guilt showed. I took away his PC and he didn't put up a fight as he normally would. Usually he would become loud, angry and physical. This was yesterday when I discovered his actions and last night he again was anxious and slept at 5am.\nToday we are on eggshells, he is explosive, angry and asking for his PC. There no way that he can be left without constant supervision. I feel so helpless, at a loss and very disappointed. I don't know what to do anymore. He informed me that he will not be going to school and doesn't care.\nI have to work, care for my little girls and I need to breathe. I don't know if I can be his mother, it feels as though we failed. We tried rewards, loss privileges, incentives, nothing has worked.\nI feel as though he is out of control and ruling our lives.\nHe was on Strattera and Intuniv, but has been weaned as these difficulties were apparent while medicated.\nAny advice, help and encouragement would be great.","like_count":"2","tags":["ADHD in Children","Living With","Treatment & Care"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Need help","resp_content":"Hi there marietml . Thank you for confiding in this board.\n\nWhile I don't know of your exact struggle, my heart goes out to you. I could only imagine what it's like to go through this. It is normal to feel as though you just want to put your hands up and give up, but there is still hope out there for your family.\n\nHere is some information on WebMD that I hope you'll find helpful:\n\n1) How to Work With Your ADHD Child's School -- http://wb.md/2dtFapt . One of the main things that is mentioned is to team up with your child's teacher, and maybe the school psychologist or a counselor and form a partnership. Once a partnership is formed, work together to come up with a plan to to manage your child's behavior, such as a 504 plan, which \"guarantees that kids with certain disabilities get special accommodations in the classroom to help them learn.\"\n\n2) Helping Your Child Get the Most From School -- http://wb.md/2dGNWjg . Success in school for a student with ADHD is important for his/her self-esteem and confidence...but the question on many parents' minds is: How can I help them to succeed and get the most from their schooling? This is a really great resource to answer that question and more.\n\n3) Impulse Control: Managing Behaviors of ADHD Kids -- http://wb.md/2dsyicp . You mentioned that one of your child's greatest hurdles is his impulsiveness. Here are some great ways that can help you to understand his impulsiveness and how to help manage it.\n\nI hope these help!\n\nMost of all, you can't do this alone. It seems like the weight of this has been on only your shoulders. You need a team of people behind you (teachers, therapists, and other experts) who can help guide you, your son and your entire family in the right direction!\n\nWe are here for you, even if it's just to listen.

You are doing everything you can with the tools you have! I would like to share with ou something I feel may be helpful to you. I am no doctor but have read up on several mental disorders. They have fascinated me and I have had family whom has suffered from several. My grandmother had manic depression, which partnered with insomnia and schizophrenia. Your story sounds like he may be dealing with more than than just Adhd. Some disorders are very difficult to diagnose. Some disorders are even more difficult to diagnose not as children, teenagers and young adults, however remember you know your child better than anyone!! You must continue to be an advocate and dont stop until you feel he is being treated properly with what works so he can have a better life. The behavior and attitudes described, and just in this one story of day camp, have, to me, similarities to manic depression. If you are dealing with this on a daily basis there would be no doubt to me this is something you need to look into. I do not intend to scare you I just urge you to read up on this, if you haven't already. An educating and heart renching journey by one parent whose child suffered from this horrible illness, Danielle Steel. His Bright Light is the story of her sons life, Nick Traina. When I read this I realized what my father has suffered with for so many years. He has medicated himself with drugs and alcohol, which has affected our relationship and for that matter all his relationships. He is a suffering from what can be a very destructive illness. This helped me to understand so many things relating to the disorder. The brilliance and the darkness. Read her book and see if you can relate to her story in any way. Education and knowledge is the key. I hope it may help to shed some light. No matter what know that you are not alone. He is fortunate to have you as his advocate and keep fighting for the answers! STAY strong!!\n"},{"author":"matthewsmom07","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Need help","resp_content":"I am in the same situation. My son is 9.

Because from your post, you seem more focused on your relationship with your fiance rather than the relationship with your son. Your son comes first. If your son with ADHD is putting a strain on your relationship that has nothing to do with your son. He has a disorder. It has to do with your relationship and the two people who comprise the relationship. Maybe your fiance should be more understanding and not overstep his bounds and let YOU handle him because he's your son. The fact that your fiance would take personally the actions of a child with ADHD is a sign of immaturity. You should all go to family therapy: you, your son and your fiance. Because not only does your son have ADHD, but he is also probably dealing with his own abandonment and behavioral issues from his birth father who you say, \"never comes around.\" it's not about DOING things for your son, it's about understanding your son on a very fundamental level and showing empathy but also instilling discipline. Not a harsh or wicked discipline. But productive and caring discipline that is rooted in LOVE, not resentment.\n\nIf you continue to say, think and affirm the thought that your son is causing the strain that is YOUR FIRST MISTAKE. He is not the problem. He is a child with a disorder. It is up to YOU as his mother to guide the way for him...and to NOT take it personally when if he struggles. If you don't think that he doesn't pick up on this way of thinking, and it indirectly causes him to act out more because he feels blamed and like a failure, then you are SORELY mistaken. Please revise this thinking for it can cause SERIOUS damage.\n\nSo in conclusion, there are several strands here that are contributing to the problem. Your son's disorder. Your fiance's lack of understanding and compassion. And your focus on your relationships with men over your son.\n\nGet a family therapist and get everyone involved in bettering your home life.\n"},{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Adhd help!!","resp_content":"Hi amymh31.

If he has it, he is legally entitled to get special accommodations to help him learn (or maybe even enter a special education program, which are now integrated into the regular classrooms). Your daughter and/or you will certainly need to advocate for him during his school years. You might want to do some research to learn more about ADHD. There are a lot of articles here on WebMD that might help. Here is one about school; the sections near the end describe the help that is available: http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/childhood-adhd/features/behavior-problems-adhd-school\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/294/adhd-add"},{"post":{"author":"dpetero","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"RE-vibe Anti-Distraction wristbands for adhd children","post_content":"I was wondering if anyone has tried this or has any feedback on this.

Except that several times, I had to request repeated meetings with the teachers so they could understand why he needed to have a \"toy\" in the classroom and stop punishing him for it (even though it was on the 504 plan they hadn't bothered to read). I eventually got smart and wrote up a detailed letter that I updated every new school year. I'd send copies to every new teacher, the counselor and the 504 administrator.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/add-adhd/218/re-vibe-anti-distraction-wristbands-for-adhd-children"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Which came first the chicken or the egg?

This went on for year until I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on Adderall. I was not taken off the antidepressant/anxiety med. It was a huge improvement when I went on the Adderall. I am still having trouble with depression and anxiety so I was moved to Cymbalta I am falling into the pit again.
