It doesn't bother me much at present. I was recommended to get a treatment with an antibiotic coating called Arestin but insurance doesn't cover it and it's $75 per pocket. I have a total of 7 pockets and was not willing to pay this much at the time. My dentist advised we follow up during my next cleaning in 6 months to assess the progression of my pockets/periodontal disease risk.\n\nI'm wondering whether there are alternatives to Arestin that doctors recommend? I'm also wondering: Is it necessary to get such a treatment or can I just continue to brush and floss regularly (at present I brush after practically every meal but always after breakfast and dinner and I floss after eating anything)? Are there less expensive ways to reduce risk or treat pockets?\n\nI'm going to also call my insurance company to see if alternative treatments might be approved (alternative antibiotic treatments, I mean...not necessarily CAM).\n\nAny insight or input or advice would be greatly appreciated.

My teeth were really messed up. The orthodontist fixed all my visible teeth, so when I smile, my teeth look good. But he didnt fix my back teeth. My back teeth on both sides curve in a lot to where my tongue barely has any space. Its always bothered me. A few days ago, I had a problem with the perminant retainer that I had put in when I was 18. While I was at the orthodontist ( a different ortho.. completely different state and I'm pretty sure my old ortho is no longer practicing), I asked him about how my back teeth curve in so much. Over the last 20 years. I've asked other orthodontist about it a few times and gotten different answers how it could be fixed. This orthodontist says he can fix it with braces. Now that I'm an adult, insurance wont cover it. Its going to be $6,000 to fix it. I keep thinking $6,000 to fix something that has bothered me my whole life isnt a big deal.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is how is it going to change my face profile if it works? My teeth in the back severely curve in to where my tongue has no room. I constantly bite my tongue eating. I don't chew gum for this reason. I'm hoping if my jaw is wider, my to tongue would have more room to move. I also have sleep apnea. I use a cpap to fix it, but maybe fixing my back teeth will give my tongue more room and relieve some of my sleep apnea issues.\n\nBut I guess I'm now wondering how my face is going to change. My jaw currently curves in on my back teeth then out (the opposite of what it's supposed to do.) If they fix it to have my jaw curve out, how will it change my face profile? I guess I'm self conscience of my underbite. My chin is too far back. As my teeth move straight, my jaw would move forward. But as they move my jaw so its curved out, maybe my chin will be in further than it is now.\n\nAlso, does anyone know how my ortho is going to pull the teeth out? Dont understand how braces on my teeth are going to force my teeth and jaw to widen. Unless I'll have to wear head gear at night and that will pull my teeth out. I'll have to ask my ortho next time I see him.

It is soft to the touch and not discolored. I can only see it in certain lighting but recently within the past month I have noticed it is pulsing with my heartbeat. I have felt my facial artery and followed it from the mandible and it feels larger on my left than on my right. I have gone to the dermatologist and they said they had never seen anything like that before. I then went to an oral surgeon who suggested I go and get an angiogram CT for the possibility it is a facial AVM. I have been worried about that possibility non stop and I wanted to post this because I have seen other people online post about similar pulsating bumps under the skin about the size of a pea near their mouths and I wanted to start this new thread because all the old ones were closed and didn’t allow me to post or comment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and if it was an AVM or if it was just that their facial artery was large and close to the surface in a particular area. I am a male and 21 years old so for it to be a facial AVM I feel that I would be diagnosed pretty late considering most AVM’s are formed around birth. I am looking to see if anyone could offer another possible theory on what it is and/or find people with the same condition so I can let you know what the results of my CT angiogram says because no one seems to know what is going on with this pulsing in my face. I am getting the CT next Friday so I will come back and post my results but in the meantime if anyone thinks they might have an alternate hypothesis please let me know and if you have this same issue, what did you find out.","like_count":"0","tags":["Mouth Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Pulsating “bump” below skin on Facial Artery on cheek about an inch from my mouth","resp_content":"Hey, what happened?

First of all, are you using a manual soft toothbrush or an electric one? Are you flossing daily? When was the last time you have seen a dentist? We brush two minutes, two times a day, floss (or use Waterpik) daily, and use an alcohol-free mouthwash twice daily after brushing to prevent bacterial plaque buildup. By keeping bacterial levels low, our gums are healthier and happier, therefore less bleeding. If you are having darker bleeding, this could mean several things: 1) overdue for a dental hygiene appt; 2) suffering from a medical issue like Diabetes. Diabetics are slow wound healers, and suffer from weaker gums; 3) if you are a woman and pregnant, you may be experiencing pregnancy gingivitis, quite common, especially for first time mommies. Any time we suffer from a cold/sinus infection, our mouths suffer as well since the immune system cannot keep the mouth healthy too. If this persists longer than a week I would make an appt with a dentist.

But this time the pain was not reducing. I took two tablets last day, but there was no change. I went to my doctor. After taking Xray the doctor told that the pain is not because of the sinus, instead, it may be due to the eruption of the third molar(wisdom tooth). This wisdom tooth is causing pressure and congestion. My doctor told me to undergo wisdom teeth removal from a clinic in Toronto( https://www.dawsondental.ca/services/wisdom-teeth/ ). The tooth is not fully erupted. I think I should wait until the tooth is completely erupted.

My dentist said that the filling cracked, so he replaced it. This was a few weeks ago. Despite having it adjusted 3 times, it has still been bothering me. It's not pain really, but discomfort, like a popcorn kernel is lodged there or something, and also sometimes sensitive to cold. Flossing does not bother me, and chewing and brushing my teeth actually make it feel better for a while. Ibuprofen does very little to help. They did an xray and said it looks fine, not abscessed, which makes sense I think, since it really doesn't hurt, but I'm still not adjusting to it after a few weeks, and the unrelenting discomfort is a struggle at times. The dentist says that I grind my teeth and thinks this may be the problem, so I had a bite plate started last week that I'm waiting on. This makes sense, as I have some other spots in my mouth, mainly bottom just left of center, that bother me on and off, which my dentist also thinks is grinding related. I've been using a store bought night guard for over a week while I wait, but haven't noticed any improvement anywhere, and the discomfort in the filling doesn't really feel grinding related to me. My only thought is that 9 years ago I had a filling done that bothered me. The dentist switched it from white to silver, saying I might deal with that better, and as I recall, I did. However when I mentioned that this time, he said that white composite has improved and that shouldn't be an issue.\nAny thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm considering seeing another dentist for a second opinion but it's hard to know where to begin, and I feel sometimes like my mouth will never feel normal again.\nThanks,\nMatt","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/51048/discomfort-after-white-composite-filling"},{"post":{"author":"marionbrown","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Teeth discoloration after root canal treatment!!!","post_content":"I have undergone a root canal treatment for my front teeth a few months ago.

It was a back tooth with a honkin' big cavity in it and, because of that, an infection, too. yay me.)\n\nSecond, that's surprisingly fast for the lump above your tooth to be gone. I can't speak for everyone, but I thought it took a bit more time before the actual lump of infection would get removed because of the penicillin.\n\nEither way, I figure that if the pain has lessened, that's a good sign. If you were taking the penicillin (I got omoxicillin... sp? amoxicillin?) and the pain got spiked up after taking it, then, if I were in your shoes, I'd be seriously worried.\n\n(mind you, I'm not a doctor or medical professional by any means. Just someone who's had the unfortunate hand of being stuck with an infection due to a tooth twice already in her life.)\nMy thoughts on this?\nGive it, at least, 5 days.\nKeep taking the penicillin to fight off that infection. (well, keep doing that regardless. Infections of any kind are nothing to take lightly since they *can* kill if left to get bad enough.)\nKeep monitoring and see how that area of your mouth, and your afflicted tooth, are doing. (This is simply a good rule of thumb in general, if you ask me.)\nIf things keep improving, then good. If you suddenly start feeling sick, feeling worse than you were before you started the penicillin, or are in oodles more pain, get your butt to a hospital as fast as humanly possible.\n\nAnd, you know, if your curiousity gets the better of you, call up your dentist and ask him / her about this. With all of their years of training and education, they're bound to know all about this stuff, and it never hurts to ask.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/39808/tooth-abscess-treatment-working-or-not-working"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Tonsil stones or hole?","post_content":"So I’ve been suffering from tonsillitis for a few days with pain especially in the left side of my throat and have just noticed what looks like a black hole on the left side of my throat, I thought it could be a tonsil stone but looks just like a hole to me, does anyone know what this is?

Two rearmost molars were extracted years ago, but the remaining two seemed to be experiencing pressure and mild tingling. Dental x-rays show the sinuses coming down around the two remaining teeth roots. The teeth tested dead during a cold test. As a matter of fact, all of the upper teeth tested negative to the cold test. That is highly unusual, but may be due to pressing the teeth together, because of the feeling of pressure. Excessive grinding can cause teeth to die.\n\nEventually, the dead molars in the area of pressure were extracted. I still have the feeling of pressure, but not as much as before the teeth were extracted. I have been waiting to have an upper partial plate made. When the last of the molars were extracted a large amount of the bony matter that holds teeth in place, in the gums, was extracted with the tooth. I have read that if not enough bony matter is in the gums, it allows the sinuses to come down around the tooth roots and that causes a sense of pressure or tingling.\n\nTomorrow, I'm having a CAT scan of the sinuses to see if there is any problem. I don't have any headaches, just the pressure and slight tingling. I do have active sinuses in the mornings with a lot of nose blowing. After a couple of hours, no more runny nose.\n\nI have read of a similar situation with 4-5 other posters on this site. One was helped by Sudafed. Another developed the problem when taking Sudafed. Another was helped by pinching the bone of her nose and pushing it to the other side. One was helped by using a Neti Pot. It does seem to be sinus related. One person said that a friend, who was a diver, said it sounded exactly like 'pneumatized sinus'.\n\nI found this: Extensive maxillary sinus pneumatization (EMSP) was defined as one in which the largest horizontal and/or vertical dimension of the maxillary sinus equalled or exceeded 90% of the corresponding diameter of the orbit.\n\nHopefully, my upcoming CAT will reveal something.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/30030/frontal-lobe-headache-and-tingling-teeth"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Tongue white coating, lumps, cracked","post_content":"I have a white coating on my tongue, more noticeable.

What you should be concerned about is a possible problem with the tooth that allowed that molar to fracture. I'd get a dental checkup (general, annual exam) and find out if there is something else besides the chip going on with that tooth. Cavity? Large existing filling (with resultant weak portions of tooth)? The cheek side of that last tooth is often not brushed very well and is, therefore, prone to getting decay, weakening the parts that are not decayed which are then easily broken. BTW, if this is a wisdom tooth, you may just want to have it removed.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Yeah I am just worried since I am on a fixed low income and do not have insurance I am stuck going to this one clinic. From what I hear they are bad about overly recomending things no nessicary such as root canals. There is no pain or any other problems so if it is a cavity or decay and that tooth breaks off more than I am fine. The only thing I worry about is the sites I have read that say infection or the bacteria spreading from the cavity to other teeth. I have never had any dental issues my whole life and now am in my 30s, so this is all new to me lol.","resp_content":"Reply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nWell, if you have a cavity (decay), then it's only a matter of time before it becomes deep enough to cause discomfort, and eventually, constant pain (i.e., the nerve is extremely inflamed or infected); if that pain keeps you from sleeping, then it's shot. In this case, root canal treatment (endodontic treatment) is the ideal treatment, mainly because you get to keep the tooth. However, in addition to that expense, you must restore the tooth, which involves a large filling, and in most cases is ideally followed by placing a crown on the tooth. Yes, it's all very expensive (esp. without dental insurance), probably in excess of $2000 total.\n\nOK, you always have the option of having it pulled (extracted), even if it could be saved. The choice is yours. That might cost you a couple of hundred dollars; I don't know. If the tooth you describe is actually the last one in the back, after a month or two you'll adapt to its loss (and it should have healed by then), and it won't really be a big deal; you won't starve.\n\nSome communities and/or counties have free dental services, services provided by volunteer dental personnel. You should investigate. If you live near a dental school, you can check there, although there usually are fees for treatment, at a reduced rate.\n\nAnyway, check these suggestions out. If your dental problem evolves to the point of serve, constant pain, your choices will end up being limited without having taken the time to thoroughly investigate your options.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/32877/some-of-a-tooth-randomly-missing-i-think-lol"},{"post":{"author":"1978z","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Breach of infection control procedures - what to do?","post_content":"I was watching my son have a root canal and an assistant from another room took the 'filling paste' syringe and ran down the hall - obviously to another patient.

After being told this I did some research on root canals. Based on this information, I think it would be reasonable for me to opt for an extraction instead of a root canal. Using only American Endodontics Association, American Dental Association studies, and other pubmed studies, I learned the following:\n\n-Root canal teeth, even when done correctly, have higher endotoxin levels than teeth with vital pulps. The mean value of endotoxin is over 28 times greater in root canal teeth, according to a study published in the Journal of Endodontics.\n-Root canal teeth are much more likely (about 40% more likely) to be effected by apical periodontitis, according to studies done by the American Endodontics Association and American Dental Association.\n-Apical periodontitis is strongly associated with brain aneurisms and heart disease, according to pubmed.\n-Endotoxins are associated with depression symptoms, according to pubmed. Specifically, the study linked root canal endotoxins to depression: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455694\n-Root canal procedures are associated with heart disease. People who have a history of root canal procedures are 1.62 times more likely to suffer from heart disease, according to this study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2735042/\nThere are other studies linking root canal procedures with heart disease as well. Also consider that some of those people may have had their root canal teeth removed early on, and this would make those numbers even higher if they had considered this in their data.\n\nI also have reason to believe that I have a low level infection that has been going on for a while, or possibly endotoxins interfering with my health. I think this because I've had horrible brain fog and low energy levels for 2 years, but when my dentist put me on a week of penicillin for my wisdom tooth removal, I felt much, much better. Like a fog had lifted for the first time in a while. I also had tachycardia and arrhythmia that went on for 6 months, then mysteriously went away.\n\nI've been unemployed for a long time because of my health. I used to be a productive, busy student with 2 jobs and an active social life before this. I think it is more likely my health will improve in the long run if I have my tooth extracted instead of getting a root canal. I want to know if I'm being reasonable. Most of the dentists I have seen dismiss all that I have to say and all my reasons, and act like they're stupid reasons, they seem to think it's ok to ignore the research. I think root canals are something only healthy people should do, because they can take a toll on your body.\n\nAlso, another dentist started a root canal on that tooth against my wishes, so the tooth is open. I had to take penicillin because my oral surgeon noticed a low level infection had started after the other dentist did that.\n\nI wanted to ask this question because I am going to lose my first (non-wisdom) tooth. I know this could possibly effect the alignment of my jaw unless I decide to get an implant, so it's a big decision.","like_count":"0","tags":["Dental Procedures","Mouth Problems","Tooth Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"otter100","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Am I being reasonable in deciding to have an extraction instead of root canal?","resp_content":"Hey.

And did you go to an endodontist, instead of just a regular dentist? (this is important to avoid complications afterwards). You may have to get the root canal re-done, an apicoectomy, or have it extracted. I suggest you look up online reviews of the endodontist before you choose one.","resp_content":"\nI did a lot of research. What I learned is that no seal is perfect, they all will leak eventually, and it is impossible to clean out all the infected dentin because there are millions of microtubules in the tooth. Even endodontists who want to sell more root canals will agree with those two facts. This means there will be small amounts of infection leaking into your body. Someone who is healthy can probably easily deal with this no problem, but if you are sensitive and/or having lots of health issues that could have something to do with an infection in your body, I think it's wise to consider getting it extracted instead. If you want to keep your tooth, a very good endodontist could probably give you a good chance of a successful procedure with no complications afterwards.\n\nI do kind of wonder if a root canal would have helped me with all the health issues and let me keep the tooth, but it seemed like such an expensive gamble, so I took the option that seemed best for my overall health.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/oral-health/9078/am-i-being-reasonable-in-deciding-to-have-an-extraction-instead-of-root-canal"},{"post":{"author":"shatteredmagic","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Issues With Tooth Extraction","post_content":"Got my tooth pulled on 4/1/17, a back molar.

I don't remember biting my cheek, however he said I may have done so in my sleep.\n\nFor the next three or four days, it got better, to the point where I could close my mouth again.

I was placed on two courses of post-op antibiotics (augmentin 1 week post op and clindamycin about 1 mo. post op) and I thought all was well. Approximately two weeks ago, I started having pain and swelling on the right side. Oral surgeon went in and debrided it. No direct cause of infection like a sliver of bone or food particle, just some pus. Started another round of clindamycin and peridex. About 10 days through this course I started having diffuse pain on my left side. The pain is mostly concentrated in the area where I had my extraction, sometimes it feels sore on the upper jaw area on that left side, sinus pain, sometimes I'll get a sharp pain up towards my ear, and sometimes I'll have some numbness/tingling towards my chin. About the only thing that takes it away is 600mg of ibuprofen about every 10 or so hours. I called my surgeons office and I'm going to see him again in 2 days for my follow-up for the right and probably a debridement on the left side as well.\n\nI'm just very scared. The symptoms on this left side are worse than they were on the right and I'm already on a good antibiotic.

I don’t believe it ever got infected: I never had any symptoms of an infection. Since I cracked the molar, I’ve been brushing the cracked molar very thoroughly, including within the recessed area of the fissure down to the exposed root. Relatively recently, approximately 6 weeks ago, I began experiencing a bitter taste in my mouth, which is overpowering when drinking bitter (or astringent) liquids, especially coffee and red wine. I haven’t changed my diet or eating habits for many years, and I’ve been taking the same type of typical once-daily multivitamins for many years. This bitter taste finally motivated me to go to the dentist two weeks ago, also because I have some receding gums with exposed roots (bot NOT gingivitis or periodontitis), and figured it was time to address my gums also. My dentist found NO signs of an infection anywhere in my mouth, but advised that my cracked molar should be extracted (scheduled for eleven days from now), and also that my teeth with the most severely receded gums should be bonded/filled (one was bonded/filled a week ago); and my dentist also observed that my teeth were very clean (probably due to my overly thorough brushing). Over my lifetime, I’ve had many colds, and a few flus and sinus infections, but I’ve NEVER experience this bitter taste in my mouth!
