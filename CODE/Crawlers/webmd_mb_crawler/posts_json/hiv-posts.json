Further testing is def not necessary unless you decided to go into full on penetration.

(While drinking I notice slight blood on her teeth & gums & when eating apple, also I notice red/orange color on my groin area while washing at my home)\n\nLater, I tried to contact her, but she left to Philippines and I came to know where she was working that, she failed in her medical and was medically terminated as she was hiv positive.

So, my question is if the infected blood from her mouth went to the cuts, so it may take maximum 2-3 seconds, so the virus is exposed to air and thus it will be unstable immediately or can live in the air for a while.\n\nI also would like to know the seroconversion duration, whether it is 7-10 days or 7-14 days, upto 4 weeks, upto 6 weeks, or 6 months or forever.

But the symptoms is still going on. Only High Esr (40) & some inflammation is there in the body. Did thrice antibiotic course of 5 days twice, but no improvement. Cannot sit/work or sleep in AC, feel whole body hot (but not more than 37.5) with mild/moderate body & joint aches/fatigue.

Maybe My immunity CD4 has been very down.\n\nMost reputable hiv doctors accepts, there is risk in giving Blowjob, So, I wanted to know, If the giver is blowing with his bleeding gums & the infected body fluid (semen/blood) from the receiver can infect the giver thru his bleeding gums, then why not the blood of giver can infect to the receiver through urethra or cuts.\n\nI have been browsing your forum since 1 years for oral sex, before going to Filipina for receiving oral sex and I was confident but, since I got the symptoms, I lost all hope. My case is different as all those who were previously received or gave blowjob they did not have so long ongoing symptoms which is classic ars flu like symptoms.\n\nTo be fair, I am very afraid of going for hiv test, due to ongoing flu type typical ars symptoms since 3+ months.

The article says that body fluids like blood can pass through broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes but it's incredibly rare to contract the HIV virus this way. The FAQ says it's possible to get HIV through oral sex although \"it's not as risky as anal or vaginal sex, but it can still happen.\" It also says the greatest risk is for the person who gets semen in their mouth after their partner has ejaculated.\n\nHave you considered taking an at-home testing kit?

However, in truth, 95 percent of newly infected folks will have enough antibodies present within 25 days of transmission to show a \"reactive\" (positive) test result. By 90 days this has increased to 99.99+ percent. 60-74 days falls somewhere inbetween these two stats.\n\nIn addition, the estimated risk of transmission for a male (from female partners) is relatively small; for insertive (that's you) unprotected penile-vaginal intercourse the estimated risk is 5 per 10,000 exposures with a partner KNOWN to carry the virus (I'm assuming this is what took place sexually). Your risk would be less since it appears you do not know if any of these partners were even HIV positive.\n\nSorry to toss all these stats at you but between the risk and the stats, it is highly, HIGHLY unlikely that any of these sexual encounters left you infected. In addition, the first stage of HIV, known as ARS tends to occur 2 to 6 weeks after transmission, is described as \"flu like\" in nature but only lasts (like the \"regular\" flu) for about 2 weeks. These symptoms tend to be respiratory in nature, not GI.\n\nIf you remain concerned and want to \"cover all bases\" (so to speak) you can, of course, take that final test at the 90 day mark from your last unprotected sexual encounter...but only to ease your anxiety.\n\nI hope this makes sense...\n\nGail\n"},{"author":"bkhannah83","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Hey Gail.

I’m worried about my unborn daughter. I made a mistake and definitely learn the biggest lesson of my life. This seems to be going around. A lot of unexplained illness after sex that doesn’t seem to be hiv. After I initially got sick I felt amazing for the next 5 weeks. Then it hit me again and has not let up since.

Last night of the trip before flying back home, I ended up going to a love hotel with an escort. It was one of the escorts specializing in anal. I used one of those 0.001mm condoms they sold in Japan but broke during sex. I didn't notice until after I realized I ejaculated in her and pulled out (Probably lasted about 10 min broken). The agency offered bareback anal but I did not select that but the given the fact that the condom was completely broken and I did not notice for 10 minutes (might as well be unprotected sex at that point with most of the penis exposed) and even though Japan has a very low HIV rate, I am still worried I might've been infected. I shaved the morning of that day which also did not help this situation.\n\nIt's been about 2 weeks since that happened and I am so paranoid about if I am infected with HIV. I read that there is a higher risk of getting infected through anal. I looked up the symptoms and do not have any flu like symptoms, rashes, vomiting, etc. The closest flu-like symptom that occurred was recent when I felt slightly dizzy and a slightly hot head for an hour but went away after. I figured this may have to do with the stress and sleeping 5 hours a day due to the anxiety and working full-time on top of that. The part that scares me is that the joint on my both thumbs started to hurt a little bit when I pressed somewhat on it. I read that joint pain is also one of the earlier symptoms. No neck joint pain or thigh area pain as of now. I did have skin peeling on my arm and face but that was due to getting sunburned and looking like a tomato. I did notice that I have slightly dry and flaky skin near my elbows but I'm not sure if that has to do with the sunburn, diet, stress, or worst case HIV. I have seen a few pinkish dots on my arm and stomach area but I think that's more towards a pimple since I always had skin problems on my chest and back (nowhere near the redness and density of a typical rash).\n\nI am considering testing with the HIV RNA test which I heard searches for the actual virus and not the antibodies and allows the test to be accurate during the window period. Is this the way I should go or should I wait a week and test with the 4th generation test?

Changed condoms twice.","post_content":"About 4 months ago, I had sex with a commercial escort. Based on her face and appearance, it looked like she could be a drug user, not sure whether its intravenous or not though. She was a Caucasian female. Out of curiosity, I asked if she allowed unprotected sex, and she said no. Then later she said, “I mean, I’m ok with no condom as long as you don’t cum inside me.” That raised some red flags. Then she said, “But I’m clean.” Then I asked when she was last tested. She replied, “I get tested every 3 months. That’s my life!” Naturally, I know better than to trust some stranger so I didn’t believe her. We started off by doing some deep french kissing, lots of tongue too for about a few minutes. I also licked her nipples with my tongue. Then we moved on to her giving me unprotected oral sex. Before she started, she asked me if I was clean. I said yes. Then she started giving me a blowjob (fellatio). Her tongue swirled around my penis head. The we moved on to protected vaginal sex. First position was cowgirl and the motion got progressively vigorous. Then we changed position to doggystyle. After a while, suddenly the condom nearly slipped out as I thrust inward, covering only a little more below my penis head, but exposing more than half of my penis shaft. My tip was slightly inside her vagina when I immediately froze once I saw it slip. I then used my hand to pull off the condom, grabbing the furthest end that was near the penis head. Then I went to go grab another condom. I then handed it to her and she tore open the wrapper and put in on my penis. But my penis was moderately flaccid at that point when she put it on and it was loose. The size of this condom might have also been too large for me. So I told her to suck on it with the condom on to get it hard again. After sucking it, it got hard again. Then we continue on to missionary position. During the intercourse she rubbed a little area above her vagina with her two fingers during the intercourse. After a few minutes my penis went flaccid or soft again, so I pulled it out with the condom fully intact but loose. I pulled it out with my hand grabbing the base. And went to grab a third condom, gave it to her and she put it on and sucked on it again to get it hard. Then i went back to missionary. It was getting soft again so I used two fingers and pinch both sides of my penis at the base of the shaft to guide it in straight to her vagina as I thrust inward. I was trying to finish with an ejaculation but I couldn’t. As I was pulling out my flaccid penis, the loose condom slipped out and stayed stuck in her vagina. I couldn’t remember if it was me or her that took out the condom though. Then we were done.\n\nThe day after, I was pondering whether I was at risk of exposure. 3 days later, I started having muscle twitches in various parts of my body such as thighs, legs, and arms. I also started to have sharp stabbing pains coming and going all over different parts of my body. My inner ear lobes were itching. I also had a few joint pain instances particularly on my fingers. I also had some muscle aches and tension, mostly on my right forearm. Roughly around 3 weeks after that suspected exposure an itchy mosquito bite-like bump appeared on my left forearm, but went away after a few hours. Could possibly be hives. A few weeks later another one appeared on my left calf. Then again on my left forearm in the same exact spot a week or so later. At around 3 weeks a little pink blotch appeared on one of my right knuckles and another one on my face to the right of my nose at over 3 months post incident. I also had a sharp pain on the left side of my head that lasted for 30 minutes at over 3 months post incident. Also at that time I woke up from bed one night with a little sweat around my neck and collar. Maybe it was a hot flash and not an actual night sweat otherwise my whole pillow would’ve been drenched. This happened at over 3 months post incident.\n\nHypothetically, if the woman was HIV positive, was there a possible risk of exposure based on any of the actions discussed above? Is it somewhat possible that I may have mishandled the switching of new condoms and her vaginal fluid might have crept inward towards my urethra underneath the condom? Maybe when condom was loose? When she did fellatio on the condom trying to harden me? Or maybe during the intercourse motion? Maybe her saliva on my penis from the blowjob caused the condom to slip out. I know that kissing an oral sex had negligible risk. I wasn’t sure if she had any sores, cuts, or bleeding gums in her mouth. Now I regret for not checking beforehand.\n\nI am absolutely terrified. I can’t sleep well. I can’t focus on my everyday tasks. My anxiety is off the charts. My twitching, stabbing pains, and muscle aches hasn’t went away. I’m not exactly sure what’s causing these symptoms. Could it be a possible infection, other STDs/STIs, my anxiety, or something else? It’s been over 4 months and I know I could’ve tested at 3 months but I held it off because I wasn’t psychologically ready to take it. I’m so afraid. Sorry for the lengthy question, but I thought it was necessary to be specific. I need some clarity, and hopefully a peace of mind when I go get tested.

What his semen looked like is, unfortunately, no indication of any STD/STI he may have.\n\nIf this helps, the estimated risk from receptive (that's you) penile-vaginal intercourse with a partner KNOWN to carry the virus is 10 per 10,000 exposures. Your risk would be less since you cannot confirm that this guy was even infected with the virus.\n\n\nKeep in mind that HIV is actually a very difficult disease to pass on to another person (this is why the low risk here). In order for transmission to take place, the virus must be able to actually enter to body; typically through an OPEN cut, wound, very damaged mucous membrane, etc.. This is very different than other STD/STI's which only require contact with membranes (or skin in some cases) for transmission to take place. Thus while HIV is often the \"biggie\" people worry about (and understandably since there currently is no cure for this) there are other diseases that are far easier to pick up through unprotected sexual contact.

But symptoms showing need advice desperately.","resp_content":"Couple of things to keep in mind...\n\nWhile one cannot diagnose HIV by \"symptoms\", issues such as dandruff, blurry vision and rashes have nothing to do with this disease.\n\nAs a general rule, it takes about a decade for an infected individual NOT on medication to transition from HIV into the latter stage of the disease (AIDS); until that time period their immune system continues to produce antibodies to the virus and thus any ELISA/antibody screening test would result in a \"reactive\" (positive) test result.\n\nIt is only when someone has reached the end stage of the disease and the immune system has been terribly ravaged by the virus that it MAY no longer be able to produce antibodies. At that point the individual often experiences severe weight loss, GI symptoms (malabsorption, diarrhea), certain types of pneumonia, often skin changes, etc. as they can no longer fight off any infection. It is this inability to fight off infections due to a lack of a functioning immune system that, eventually, causes death from this virus.\n\nIf you can't work and you can't sleep it is perhaps understandable why you are becoming fatigued and losing weight; this may explain your symptoms more than anything else. However, if you remain concerned and wish more testing, the test you should be requesting is a viral load, not more antibody testing. Viral load testing would look for the actual presence of the virus in your blood.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nGail\n2\n"},{"author":"testrwrong","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you Gaili was thinking my immune is declining gradually day by day one other problem is arising so just wanted to make sure whether I am on the line of progression towards AIDS.","resp_content":"Reply\ntestrwrong\nover 3 years ago\nThank you Gaili was thinking my immune is declining gradually day by day one other problem is arising so just wanted to make sure whether I am on the line of progression towards AIDS.\n"},{"author":"jorge123n","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: HIV Rapid test after 6-8 years.

Only through testing can one know their status. However, quite frankly, ARS (the first stage of HIV) is described as \"flu like\" in nature; occurs two to six weeks after transmission and lasts about two weeks.\n\nYou don't have oral thrush connected with HIV. Oral candida in HIV is seen at the end stage of the disease when one has progressed from HIV onto AIDS. As a general rule (in an untreated individual) this occurs about a decade after transmission not 10 weeks later. It's also an incredibly painful medical condition. What you're seeing is the white tongue most of us have (especially in the morning when we wake up) that has made you think of thrush after your reading of symptoms on the internet.\n\nAt any rate, look at your risk this way. By four weeks post transmission, approximately 95 percent of newly infected folks will have enough antibodies present to show a \"reactive\" (positive) test result when undergoing antibody screening.

Having one is absolutely no indication that one is also infected with HIV.\n\nYou are certainly not the first person who, after reading about symptoms on the internet, have convinced themselves they must be infected with this virus. Further reading only adds fuel to each that every itch, sneeze, cough, headache, joint pain, etc. is further proof of infection. Fear and sadness affects their appetite, sleep, bowel habits which only makes things worse.\n\nWhen the vast, VAST majority finally get tested they are quite shocked (and hopefully happy) to learn the test results are \"non-reactive\"; in other words, they are not infected with the virus and that stress and worry only worsened symptoms that, in the end, had nothing to do with HIV.\n\nThe point is, instead of sitting around planning your death at age 25, go and get tested. I strongly suspect you'll be joining those who are quite pleasantly surprised at the results. Please do this as your worry over a disease you likely do NOT have seems to be eating away at you.

No point in stressing and asking yourself why you? who do you want it to be dear? I like that you bring God into this...please re-read the bible and refer to the book of Mathews/Job and pray to God to clear your mind of all negativity in your mind - as much as its hurting to have HIV, I had to go through lots of counseling to accept it and deal with my anger and shame - its normal you know? how you are feeling... but you shouldn't be an absolutist - you have never tested - don't be scared - just like everything that is tough/or change... in life, its hard at the beginning but with time, this too shall come to pass, God uses trials and tribulations to bring us closer to Him, nothing bad comes from God, sicknesses are all from the devil - remember the book of Job, how the devil made a pact with God that Job would eventually give up as God's child? God's children do not speak the way you do, change your self-talk, stop blaming yourself, it isn't your fault because no one wants to have HIV...but if you do have it, talk and talk and talk about how you feel, its important and its a way to heal - don't feel bad if ever, you are positive and have infected your girlfriend, my boyfriend, who is now, 5 years later my husband, infected me, we were both ignorant and did not use protection, he never knew he had it, two years down the line, physically he started to change, it could not have been easy for him, when I told him and another family doctor friend told him to get tested, well, he was really scared, but I told him, that if he was, I will not leave him for that reason, he was very much HIV positive, and I am too, I never left him. I was angry yes, I hated him too, but through communication, with others and with him and therapy for my side also, on how to deal with it, time heals...if not completely but it does to some extent, I still loved him very much, so now, after all this journey, its like, were taking blood pressure pills...the fact that were both positive is one of the greatest advantages - we both support each other - if one of us has sores - we inspect each other and life has gone on...were a team, I could not have asked for a better team mate throughout all this...life goes on, if u r hiv positive, and it will go on for you too, for both of u,...well my partner, he hasn't told his family, I understand due to stigma, being a man, ego, shame, all these things are normal but no one is forcing you to tell anyone or even family, you confide in those you are guaranteed to have support from, and even these blogs really help, knowing that we are not alone....my dear...hiv isn't a death sentence...its come to be a way of life, every 2nd person you meet now has hiv, worldwide, if you \"are\" positive, work on your pain and learn techniques for acceptance and avoid self-blame, you need to be brave otherwise, if you are positive and carry on this way...surely your health will not respond positively, don't be ashamed to keep in touch and its ok to moan and stress and feel ashamed, God made us emotional beings, but test first, before you get sicker from stress...it isn't good for you, you are still very young and life has great plans ahead for you, hiv or not hiv...if your girl loves you and if you are really close and meant to be, she will forgive u, and that is if, you are positive, for now, just go and test, it does not have to be around your community...there are lots of testing stations and you will be treated with dignity and respect, allow yourself to face this, the sooner you know, the better off you will be...but for now, you only have symptoms of something you don't know...go test...go treat those symptoms and stop brooding, time heals all wounds and if you are not positive.

I'm still trying to convince my self that I'm not getting HIV. But I will be going for the test soon. I'm still working and trying to find the best time, also find the best doctor to consult with. I don't want anyone to know this. I have been avoiding sex with my partner since I started getting the symptoms. My work requires lots of travelling between cities , so it's kind of pain in the ***. I constantly get headache, muscles and joint pain, really painful neck (like something is stabbing my neck), pain around my chest, short of breath and easily get tired. I only climbed like 5-10 stair steps and i'm already suffocating. Whenever I'm exposed to sun, I sweat a lot. As I'm typing right now, I'm still suffocating. I have been taking some pain killers but none has worked, it's like i'm not taking any pain killers at all.\nI also found rash on my thigh today, it just appeared for no reason, it wasn't there last night.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR REPLYING.\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nMy partner had lots of boils, and I had boils on my private parts but we thought its because they are contagious, so time went on, until one nurse told us to test, normally boils are a sign of hiv, I don't remember if I had other symptoms, but when that nurse told us to test, we thought she was crazy and did not want to offer meds for the boils, but then my partner, had a tremendous loss of weight, his colour started to change and he looked really sick plus he had lots of fevers and I constantly had to take care of his temperature, so one day he decided he'd go test, we have been on meds ever since, I think all you are experiencing is stress, it does that you know, making you feel sicker and sicker and because you are aware of every little thing, more stress for you, more symptoms, the advantage of travelling different cities is what you should capitalize on, test there. then drive back to get our results. Its painful to find out, I will not lie, if its true, take leave, you can even admit yourself for depression, just to let all information sink in, one needs that. I have always been brave to test for hiv cause I never had a partner but it was my responsibility to check as an adult, this time on, I never tested, never thought of it, so it was a shock to me. But all this said, you are human, take care of yourself, its something you have to do, for yourself, if you are this worried, and the more you delay, the more sicker you will be, do you know stress can give you a stroke? Get on top of things and have control over your life, you were not reckless on purpose, if you hiv, its human nature, sometimes we are irresponsible, so what??is it the end of the world? did anyone die,NO, so no need to stress, attend to your needs and stop delaying, maybe you don't even have it, you are just depressed, due to your thoughts. Don't hesitate to write back and let us know how it all went, don't fear the unknown, an absolutist is someone who already anticipates an outcome, without having proof, so you don't know if you are positive you just have all these symptoms, maybe its stress and you better test before xmas, so that you can have enough time to reflect and start the new year with a plan. You need a plan to survive, \"if\" you are positive, if not, better try harder at being careful, if I could reverse the hand of time, I would not have asked my partner 5 years ago to take out the condom as it was hurting me, I did, and he listened to me, and now were both hiv positive, so u know what, in a way I am glad, I am more stronger than him in personality, and I am glad im one person who can go through this journey with him, im trying to teach him that he has inner strenghth, more than he ever thought, and im motivating him to tell one family member, his favourite aunt, and life will be more balanced for him, so this inner strenghth, you have it, push yourself, its a test, go test, alone, and you will be fine...time heals and times goes on so that in the process, we can look back and see how far we have come as individuals, hiv or no hiv....im sure you have had problems in the past and overcame them, this too, treat it like a problem, its never nice in the presence, but time heals, time helps us to make sense and there are a lot of people who are positive and living positive lives, its up to you...reach out to us, or suffer alone in silence...\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nThank you so much .

These are TWO TOTALLY UNRELATED VIRUSES. It is far easier to transmit HSV than it is to transmit HIV. The former virus only needs contact with skin/mucous membranes for transmission. HIV, on the other, must actually ENTER the body for transmission to occur.\n\nThus, despite taking a \"home test\" (and I'm assuming you did this accurately) you have now not only convinced yourself you must be positive, you are driving yourself literally sick with what you think are symptoms.\n\nI'm not sure an internet forum can change your mind on any of this.

I have been enduring this.\nReply\ngeorgiagail\nover 2 years ago\nThe Western Blot test is used to confirm the accuracy of the initial antibody screening test. There are cases of what is known as \"false positive\" test results from the antibody screening tests; antibodies that RESEMBLE those seen in HIV infection but not connected with this virus. Thus the test result is a \"false positive\"; the individual is not infected.\n\nA second test, known as a Western Blot needs to then be run to confirm (or rule out) whether the patient is HIV positive. If the Western Blot also comes back as \"reactive\" the diagnosis is confirmed; the person is HIV positive. If the Western Blot comes back as \"non reactive\" the person is considered to be HIV negative and the first screening test was a \"false positive\" result.\n\nI hope this makes sense...\n\nGail\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nHi Gail,\n\nYes, I get it.

But 10 days after this possible exposure I got my nodes swolen. They stayed like that for couple of days and went away. I had other symptoms like itchy hands in the morning. Actually to this day these symptoms are coming and going but its rare. Like every once in a week. Doctor said if you had hiv, swolen nodes wouldnt go away and came back.\n\nAnyhow, the problem is I get these symptoms I never had. 2 days ago I discovered scrabs in my hair. I checked it online.

I inserted my finger in the vagina for may be a minute or two and I wore a condom on my finger while doing this. She then shook mine till I ejacuated. now what scares me is that since that day till date I have been having stiff neck most of the time. I am feeling very tired and now since yesterday the left side near my groin there was a small lump which I broke and then it is become hard. I am scared of things after reading so many websites I need help from you people on what should I do. first I am scared that when she started giving me blowjob and the condom must have broken and that's why she must have put another one and that time I may have come in contact with her body fuids or saliva. and also when I fingered her the index finger I had a very small cut this was not bleeding or open but im concerned since I got this boil on groin now which is become hard after I have kept on pressing it so it this the lypmh node that I broke or something. please help me and guide me what should I do.

Think along the lines of .5 to 1 per 10,000 exposures with a source KNOWN to carry the virus. And even if the condom broke, AND this partner was even HIV positive, the virus does not live in saliva.\n\nFingering is not a risk for picking up HIV and certainly not when someone is doing this wearing a condom.\n\nThe fact you have HSV is unimportant in terms of HIV transmission. Most adults carry HSV.\n\nWhat you're feeling is guilt over visiting this person and having them perform oral sex on you and then masturbate you. Because of that you believe you now must be punished in some way. HIV doesn't work that way.

Testing beats what folks think are \"symptoms\" each and every time.\n\nHere's the time line for symptoms of HIV. Shortly (two to six weeks) after transmission, newly infected folks with undergo a short term bout of \"flu like\" symptoms. This is ARS. Like the \"regular\" flu, this lasts about two weeks.\n\nAfter that, nothing, nada, zippo. No symptoms. It's really not until the virus has seriously affected the immune system that one would begin to see some serious symptoms. On average this may take as long as a decade after the initial infection to begin (in an untreated individual). One reason why so many may be walking around infected and not realize this.\n\nIt's not unusual when someone worries they may be infected to go on the internet and read about symptoms.

We had unprotected oral and protected vaginal sex twice (once eleven weeks ago and once seven weeks ago), after the second time a couple days later I noticed sores on my vagina that I assumed were herpes which made sense to me since he had performed unprotected oral sex on me. A couple days later I got it tested and came back positive for HSV 1, typically oral herpes. I started to get anxious about my HIV status, I had never been tested before but after contracting herpes I thought I should. Well I also just started birth control at thattime and about four to five days later started to experience mild headaches which I at first attributed to that. I also had had a cough for a month at that point that I thought nothing of. Well six weeks later I noticed a dry patch in between my fingers that was very itchy. I had a history of eczema so I bought cortozone lotion for it and it disappeared in around a day. I started to have really bad anxiety about it though and then started experiencing a sore neck and shoulders and sorenessunder my shoulder. I freaked out and bought an oraquick test (6 and ten weeks post exposure) which came back negative but it still didn't calm me down. I went to the clinic and had the nurse check to see if I had swollen lymph nodes which she said I didn't but I'm doubtful of her assessment. She also said a lot of my symptoms could be due stress. I was still nervous so I bought another oraquick oral swab test a couple days later which again came back negative. Then one night I woke up twice with night sweats and that really terrified me. I bought my last test at 7 and 11 weeks post possible risk events (I should note I'm unaware of this mans HIV status but he says he is negative. I'm pretty sure he isn't gay or an IV drug user which ik would greatly reducehis risk of having it, ive also asked his friends all of whom have said he doesn't have it) and it came back negative also but just this morning I noticed a possible cankor sore in my mouth. I haven't had these in years and it terrified me because I know that this is one of the symptoms of HIV. so my questions are\n\n1.

Think along the lines of an estimated risk of .5 to 1 per 10,000 exposures with a source KNOWN to carry the virus and, in this event, with ejaculation taking place.

Come to March/April 2017, a girl had performed oral sex on me and had given me chlamydia. I ran to the clinic after I realized the symptoms I was having. I had performed an hiv at home test that had shown up negative as I was freaking out about the girl I was sleeping with. The test was negative. The urgent care place I went to had tested me for some std’s as well. HIV tested negative, chlamydia was positivre so I treated with one dose of I forgot what it was. I had no sexual contact up until about 3 weeks ago with someone I have known for a while. Her last partner (2nd person she has ever slept with) was sep 2016. She had a full std screening may 2017 with everything negative. Three weeks ago we had slept together. The condom broke and she said she was tested in may and has not slept with anyone since 2016.

Think along the lines of a risk of .5 to 1 per 10,000 exposures with a source KNOWN to carry the virus. It appears you do not even know if your partner was infected with the virus in the first place.\n\nIn an infected (and untreated) individual it takes, on average, about a decade to move from HIV to the end stage of the disease (AIDS). Quite honestly, if you had been infected a dozen years ago from this event and had been untreated through all those years you'd either be VERY, VERY ill with highly significant symptoms or (frankly), dead by now.\n\nYou don't have HIV.

I had a risky sex on AUGUST 9TH at a massage parlour with a woman. After some friendly touch, I did some fingering mostly in her vagina and a bit anal way with my right hand. After that I put on a latex condom. I believe and hope (!) that I did not use my right hand while putting on the condom. (IS THIS A RISK?)\nAfter I put on condom, I did vaginal penetration slowly, and that last at most 20 seconds.\nI pulled out, after that, I could see the condom still on my penis, and semen in the condom. It seemed proper.\nAfter that I remember I removed my condom, and cleaned around my genital area with a dry towel. (I am scared that maybe I touched my urethrea before the towel, or inside my nose with my right fingers after the towel.) (IS THIS RISK?)\nAfter a week, I became paranoid, thinking what if she was HIV positive. EXACTLY AFTER 7 DAYS (AUGUST 16TH), I went to see her again. I requested her to do a rapid HIV test. The result seemed positive to me. So I told her to go to a clinic and get it confirmed.\nIn the meantime, I got also HIV test on AUGUST 16TH. The result was surely negative.\nShe texted me 2 days later. She said she was positive. She said; she had unprotected sex only with her boyfriend; she was probably infected in the 1st or 2nd week of May after his business trip; in the beginning of June, she had some light flu and afterwards some cough. (So this makes her just at the end of WINDOW PERIOD on AUGUST 9th, right?)\nAfter that I immediately visited a clinic and explained my case to a doctor. Doctor told me; I have 2 advantages: 1st I used a condom, 2nd I am circumsized.\nStill I insisted to have a viral load test. Doctor said OK. I got the viral load test done on AUGUST 18TH (9 DAYS AFTER SEX).\nIn the meantime, on AUGUST 19TH and AUGUST 20TH, I started taking ARVs which doctor prescribed. (Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg, Lamivudine USP 600mg, Efavirenz USP 200mg). ARVs made me dizzy, so I stoppped on AUGUST 21ST and AUGUST 22ND.\nI got the viral load results on AUGUST 23th. The test is called “HIV-1 Viral Load by Taqman Plasma (Quantitative)”. It read as “below 20 copies/ml” and log value “below 1.30”. It reads as “HIV RNA DETECTED (!), less than 20 HIV/RNA copies/ml)”\nI got terrified. The doctor told me to continue ARVs. I immediately started again. I am scared because this time ARVs make me feel a bit less dizzy. DOES THIS CONFIRM THAT I HAVE HIV VİRUS? Because doctor told me that ARVs make HIV-positive people feel better, but HIV-negative people bad, dizzy, vomitting, etc.\nFinally doctor told me to finish ARVs (30 per box, one per day) and after I finish ARVs, we will run additional tests or a second viral load test.\nWHAT TEST SHOULD SHE DO THEN? ANOTHER VIRAL LOAD TEST? OR ELSE?\nSHOULD OR CAN I TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL MEDİCATİONS?\nSHOULD I STOP ARVs?\nThese are the questions I have now.\nI am very scared but I am trying to stay strong. So please I need your support and valuable opinions!\n(As for symtoms: Between 15th – 22nd AUGUST, I developed a flu which seems to have stopped by now. I am scared that I will have more symptoms in upcoming weeks. DO ARVs ALLEVIATE SUCH SYMPTOMS IN THE WINDOW PERIOD?)\nI asked so many questions. I am so sorry for taking this much time of yours.

Obviously you went to a physician who knows little or nothing about HIV. I'll try to explain.\n\nSomeone who was recently infected (and likely not yet producing many antibodies) would have an extremely high viral load. Viral load testing typically doesn't come with \"zero\" copies cut off; they will have a cut off that might say \"less than 20 copies\" or might say \"less than 5 copies\" depending on the test used. What this actually means in your case is ZERO copies; zip, nada, nothing.\n\nNot to sound mean but if your physician had any common sense they would have pointed out that your \"risk\" consisted of fingering her vaginally and anally. THIS IS NOT A RISK FOR HIV TRANSMISSION EVEN IF YOU DID PUT THE CONDOM ON WITH THE SAME HAND.\nKeep in mind that HIV is an EXTREMELY delicate virus outside of the body. Picking your nose, drying your genital area with the same hand that fingered her would NOT transmit the virus to you.\n\nYou did ALL the right things; you had PROTECTED vaginal intercourse with this woman.

It made me feel really good! Thanks million times again! I promise myself and God that I will never take such risks again!! I realised that I really appreciate life!\n\nI have to say I read it before I received my PCR RNA qualitative test results. It is NEGATIVE! (I could not help myself and I took an additional test!)\n\nHope you may understand, I still want to share some details with you:\nPCR-HIV QUALITATIVE: NEGATIVE (Performed using the Roche COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS Taqman HIV-1 Qualitative Version 2.0 assay.)\n\nIt reads more as follows: The qualitative DNA HIV PCR test may be used for the diagnosis of HIV infection in the following circumstances:\n1. Any patient 2 weeks after known exposure to HIV or 2 weeks after \"prophylactic ART (?)\" is completed. In all instances, the PCR results should be confirmed with an ELISA after 6 weeks.\n2. Babies under 18 months of age…\n3. For confirmation of indeterminate HIV ELISA results.\n\nJust to remind you… My exposure was on AUGUST 9th, and this blood sample was taken on AUGUST 29th (i.e. after 20 days). However, as I mentioned, I have been using ARVs (one pill per day) since AUGUST 23th.\n\nSo, I beg your understanding for these 2 additional questions below:\n\n1) Even if I used ARVs between AUGUST 23th and AUGUST 29th (in total 7 days), may I assume that those ARVs would NOT suffice to influence the result of my latest PCR HIV QUALITATIVE test?\n\n2) Because the test says “2 weeks after prophylactic ART is completed”. My ARVs (Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg, Lamivudine USP 600mg, Efavirenz USP 200mg), ARE THEY “PROPHYLACTIC ART”?\n\n(I read somewhere on http://helpline.aidsvancouver.org that “the early PCR test and p24 antigen test are most accurate within the first 3 weeks of infection”) I pray God that this test result of mine is certain!\n\n3) This test “the Roche COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS Taqman HIV-1 Qualitative Version 2.0 assay” is, I hope the latest state of art in testing?\n\n(Please note that I will still take an ELISA test 6 weeks after exposure.

Fingering someone vaginally and anally and then putting on a condom with the same hand is NOT a risk for HIV transmission.\n\nHonestly. Really. Truly. I would not lie to you about this.\n\nFrom your posting I suspect at least some of what you are feeling is perhaps guilt at what you did in that massage parlor. I'm not sure why (and perhaps I am reading this incorrectly) but again, please understand that you did all the right things by engaging in protected intercourse with a latex condom.\n\nYou can, of course, continue testing.

Strictly relating to ARS. The only symptoms I have developed since then were:\n\n1) Dry cough, 4 week duration\n2) Discomfort in the throat on and off (but not your typical \"pins and needles\" sore throat), 5 week duration\n3) Boils\n4) On and off pain in my muscle (left forearm and heel tendon), 4 week duration and is now gone\n\n7 weeks BEFORE my exposure with this female and I happened to have the misfortunate of having the condom slip out upon having sex. I may have been exposed to her vagina for roughly 30 seconds. 5 days later I did feel a bit tired or uneasy by the end of the week but immediately took my temperature twice during the day and evening and they both read 98.6 and 98.8 F, respectively (37 and 37.1 C, respectively). Since then I did not feel any overall body discomfort or fever.\n\nRegarding my dry cough after my unprotected exposure I produced no phlegm or fever and the dry cough was more prominent when I would breathe in really deep or when I was laughing (pretty much gone at this point). Also less frequent or non-existent now, at the time I would get minor chest discomfort. I have been able to engage in 60-90 mins of high intensity cardio without having to catch my breath.\n\nI have also noticed a weird \"discomfort\" in the throat which is the symptom that has lasted the longest. It is not your typical sore throat with the pins and needles feeling upon swallowing or eating but much rather a slight discomfort on the right side of the back of my throat that comes on and off throughout the day with a possible mass on the right side. BTW I visited a nurse practitioner who actually said she did not notice a mass but I still have this on and off \"sore throat discomfort\" that has been there for 3 weeks but I only just noticed the possible lymph node mass that was disregarded but I am not fully sure.\n\nI have checked like crazy and to my knowledge have not noticed any enlarged lymph node in my axilla (shoulder), groin area or cervical area (besides the one mentioned above). I did however notices 3 boils, 2 in my groin/thigh area and armpit area which I ended up squeezing and they all produced pus meaning it was more like an infection but I'm not sure.\n\nLastly, I also had severe skin itching that started almost a week after my exposure but it is basically gone now on or maybe it has subsided immensely or i don't notice anymore (NO RASH) and this on and off muscle/tendon ache for 4 weeks that constantly appears in heel tendons (more right than left foot) and my left forearm muscle but I do not have a general body ache. The ache could be there for a number of minutes (it varies from maybe 10 to 60 mins) and then suddenly reappear like an hour or two later or not at all during the day. Very confused by that.\n\nI was worried about a possible Herpes infection too because of a dry scaly rash I noticed in my genital area 3 days after exposure (but that was brought up in another forum) which I heard can be related to nerve itching or pain that may be affecting my muscles so I am not sure.

After 5 weeks of testing at that location, I went to Government AIDS resource and got tested there with -ve result again with clearview rapid test.

When I asked to have an hiv test done I asked my doctor if it would be the fourth generation and she said yes. I got my results back yesterday and they were non reactive. However I called the lab and they said they only do the antibody tests and not the fourth generation antigen ones. So now I'm upset because my doctor lied to me and gave me the wrong test. It's pretty much useless to take just the antibody test at 1 month isn't it? I thought the window period for that test is 3 months at least. If you have any insight into this it would be very much appreciated. Now I feel worried and anxious all over again.\nReply\ngeorgiagail\nover 2 years ago\nIt is not useless to take the antibody test at one month. At LEAST 95 percent of newly infected individuals would have enough antibodies by 25 days past transmission to show a \"reactive\" (positive) test result.\n\nIn other words your antibody test 31 days after a \"potential\" exposure (which, quite honestly, does not sound like an exposure at all since it involves condom use except you cannot be sure if a bit of the ejaculate may have dribbled out and oral sex without ejaculation) is not useless; indeed, it shows your HIV negative status.\n\nI hope this makes sense and brings you some comfort.\n\nGail\nReply\ngirl2929\nover 2 years ago\nThank you for the reply, your response did calm me and help me realx! It's good to know my risks were very low. I'm feeling better about it now and better about my results. And sorry my incident happened on August 31 so technially I got tested at 30 days after that night not 31. Would that one day matter much for test reliability? And one more thing I was wondering about concerning HIV window periods. Since HIV can take a few days to actually infect a person fully, wouldn't you need to count at least a few days after your exposure to get the correct \"window period\" for testing? I'm just worried that if I did contract it a few days after my exposure like on August 2 then I would need to count down from then. Which would have meant I tested at 28 days not 31. Sorry if I'm being confusing it's just something I've been pondering. What do you think? Oh and also the second time I gave him oral it was about 15 to 20 minutes after we had protected sex and he ejaculated. So there was probably some sperm on his penis after we had sex from the condom he had on? Not sure if that would be the same as if he would have actually ejaculated into my mouth. I did also do some deep throating when I gave him oral, I don't know if that makes it more of a risk. Thank you so much for answering all my questions so far.

I consider myself to be very fortunate because it now ranges around 1600. My advice to you is that you have a doctor that first, is a specialist in the field and second, that he/she gives you as much time as you need for any medical complications that arise. In the beginning, after the diagnosis that you have a potentially deadly disease, you need to allow yourself to grieve and adjust, and you need the support of a physician that understands this. I also had a wonderful support system with my family and though I didn't utilize support programs or a therapist, it may be something that you should consider. Believe me when I tell you that you need inner strength in order to make the most of the treatment you receive for this devastating diagnosis. Early on I had several bouts of pneumonia that sent me to the hospital, but when you are on the proper 'cocktail' you should be able to fight an illness without losing ground with your CD4 (T-Cell) count. My doctor ran tests that defined the medications that were most effective for my body. Has this been done? Truly, I would recommend finding a doctor that will take your health as seriously as you do, and as I mentioned, find the support that you deserve so that you can live a long and fruitful life.

I was definitely HIV negative at this time. About 2-3 weeks later I had an extremely uncomfortable sore throat, headache and tiredness and around this time my partner also started having headaches and tiredness. I also experienced an array of symptoms that were probably anxiety caused.\n\nAt 28 days I had a full set of screening performed which came back negative. The clinic said that no further appointment was necessary. At once a lot of my anxiety symptoms disappeared completely but I continued to have sore neck/back muscles. I use a laptop for work so it is possible it could have been related to this.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started to come down with something following my partner experiencing some gastrointestinal problems which she considered to be IBS. My symptoms for the past week+ have been as follows:\n\n-NO fever or rash\n-Throbbing, dull headache at the top of the head, EXTREME tiredness, struggling to focus/work\n-Moderate sore throat, sneezing, coughing, runny nose\n-Extremely stiff neck all of the time, nothing seems to help this\n-Dull aches which could be related to lymph nodes behind the ear, but no noticeable swelling\n-Extremely bad gastro problems/pain/pressure. Bloating and nausea all of the time. Around 20-30 mins after I eat my stomach goes into a frenzy of pain and bubbling which lasts for 1 hr, after this is fine. All foods/drinks seem to affect it the same. This is focused on the left side.\n-No diarrhoea or vomiting\n\nI had a subsequent HIV test at 84 days which I am waiting the results from.\n\nMy questions are:\n-I can’t seem to isolate this to influenza or gastroenteritis (stomach flu) due to the combination of neck/head/throat/stomach symptoms all at the same time. I can safely say I have never experienced gastro problems like this in my life. Likewise, my partner having this same gastro problem means I know this is a viral infection of some sort. Is it at all likely that HIV could present itself in this way with no fever and no rash? Are there any other viruses which present themselves in both the respiratory and intestinal systems at the same time?\n-My negative 28 day test seems to be fairly conclusive based on what I can read. However, my symptoms at 2-3 weeks and now at 11-12 weeks are extremely concerning me. Is it possible that the lateness of my symptoms would correspond with a later seroconversion and subsequently my test results changing? Or is this far too late for ARS at this stage?\n-Are the dull aches behind my ear/stiff neck related to lymph nodes? Coincidental laptop use? Or just the effect of a general viral infection?\n-Would it be possible, if I transmitted HIV to my partner, that she would display ARS symptoms before me? Does each person react differently or would you expect the 1 week gap between myself contracting and my partner contracting to correspond with the timing of symptoms?\n-Overall, based on the fact this was a single incident with a woman, multiplied by the probabilities of my 28 day test etc, is it within reasonable possibilities that I do in fact HIV or is it possible to almost rule it out at this stage?","like_count":"0","tags":["Possible Exposure","Symptoms","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"georgiagail","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Extremely concerned late ARS","resp_content":"ARS, the first stage of HIV, occurs two to six weeks after transmission and not 11-12 weeks later.

Like the regular flu these will last about 2 weeks.\n\nAfter that, nothing until the virus has severely damaged the immune system. On average this will take up to a decade after the initial transmission. Thus when folks begin to post a bunch of symptoms shortly after a potential exposure it's often a sure bet they've spent some time reading about symptoms seen at the end of the disease on the internet. Fear of the disease often makes things much worse for them. For some this fear can become crippling.\n\nIn the end, testing beats any symptoms hands down. Your 84 day test results will come back as \"non-reactive\" (negative); same thing as the previous test did. Please come back and let us know the result, OK.?

While there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, you can read about the treatment options available to you here: http://wb.md/2cOLabV . It is important for you to know that HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence and it is possible for you to live a long and productive life if you make healthy lifestyle choices and develop a treatment plan that is best for you.\n\nDue to the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS, someone who has just received a diagnosis might feel full of shame and as if they are completely alone, which makes it all the more difficult to verbalize your status to those closest to you. Telling your friends and family your status is a big step and one that you need to be ready for. Here (http://wb.md/2d5yIEg) is a great resource about things you should consider when telling your loved ones about your status.

I was infected by my boyfriend of two years by then and the thing is he did not know and I thought we were both negative. Our first sexual encounter happened without a condom which is what many of us irresponsibly do. I went for a test after a month and after the third month too. It was negative, so we both assumed that we were both negative, stupid of us then. My partner had always been scared to go but when I went and it came negative, we relaxed, we were misinformed about HIV. After a year he started losing a lot of weight and physical changes were also worrying but we thought it was stress because he was unemployed at the time. We had moved to a new province just the two of us and had no support system, we both come from dysfunctional families. We had each other atleast. I started developing lesions in weird places and one day a nurse told me to go test. But I thought NO I don't have it! But then my boyfriend started to lose more weight rapidly and when I finally convinced him to test, he agreed but did not tell me until the holidays because he knew I would not handle it well while going to work. After he told me it took a great strain on our relationship. I had self loathing, I was always crying, I was depressed, I felt alone and hated the person who infected me, I was constantly blaming him and angry that he infected me, but the truth was he did not know and we were both to blame. The point of my story is, with time, it will get better, talk to healthcare professionals anytime you get, find someone elderly perhaps whom you can trust and confide in, come into this chat community and vent out as often as you can, God says it shall come to pass and He will never give you too much to handle, don't worry in time you are going to heal and the blame you have to let it go so that you can be strong and have a way forward, the fact is the more you stress you are inviting other sicknesses to enter you and prolonging the healing process. I'm sorry you were infected in that manner but take responsibility and forgive yourself for not using a condom and always know that you cannot undo it. Its easier said than done but you will heal eventually and be strong. Every opportunity you get speak to someone about it, you will see u will uncover a deep wound and it will heal faster. Don't rush to tell people seek counseling first and then when you have accepted and are strong, then you can tell your family and when they see how well you are doing about the whole matter it will make you feel good. In time .....one day you will look back on the day you found out and see how far you have come.\n2\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/479/i-have-hiv-aids"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Could this affect the accuracy of the test?","post_content":"Hi everybody.\n\nToday is June 27, 2017.

I haven't ate slept since I found out I had Trich. This is very devastating\nReply\ngeorgiagail\nover 2 years ago\nThere are certain STD's/STI's that are easy to pass around, requiring only contact with skin or mucous membranes for transmission. Trich is one of these. HIV on the other hand is one of THE hardest to transmit to another human being. Transmission requires that the virus must be able to actually ENTER the body; typically through an open (i.e., bleeding) cut, wound, damaged mucous membrane, injection site, etc.. Even swallowing the sexual fluids of an infected individual would not transmit the virus to someone as the very strong stomach acids would simply dissolve the virus.\n\nIt is therefore important not to assume that picking up one of the more common sexual diseases does not mean you are also infected with HIV. Really.\n\nGail\n1\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nThanks for this. He only did precum and not full ejaculation.

I don't recall becoming seriously ill in the days or weeks falling this event. a few weeks after this event I had blood in my semen one time, and I have not had blood in my semen since. In late January of 2017 ( 4 months after the event) I went out and purchased an oraquick in home hiv test. I had to leave the test in my car for about an hour and a half before I got home. I put the test in a backpack and then put the backpack in my trunk. My thinking was that this placed seemed to be the coolest part of my car since the car is white and will reflect most sunlight. I did all of this because the test said to not store the test in temperatures above 80 degrees. I believe it was in the mid 60s that day. I came home and took the test and got a negative result, with a line at C and no line at T. I am worried that keeping the test in my car could have compromised the actual test.

Testing beats symptoms each and every time. Your condom may have been cheap but it was latex and, from your description, remained intact throughout the sexual encounter. Thus, although your partner was later found to be HIV positive, the virus could not have cross over an intact latex condom.\n\nI suspect what you might be doing is continuing to read about symptoms regarding HIV/AIDS over the Internet and have now self-diagnosed yourself as having this virus, despite these test results. You would not be the first person to do this. But it may be helpful to keep in mind that the last stage of HIV (AIDS) does not occur just 2+ years after initial transmission and many of what you think are symptoms connected to AIDS (white tongue, peripheral neuropathy, weight loss) are seen in an untreated individual about a decade after the initial transmission.\n\nOthers who have worried excessively about a disease that testing has shown they do not have will report issues with headaches, trouble eating/swallowing, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, stomach aches, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, depression. Lymph nodes (especially in the neck area) are near the surface of the skin and are easily felt; we just don't normally try to feel them unless we worry about diseases such as HIV and then we can poke at the poor things until they will swell in protest.\n\nYour symptoms are very real but they have nothing to do with HIV as testing has clearly shown you do not have the virus. The issue then becomes how much of this is caused by stress and worry over a disease you don't have.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nGail\n1\n"},{"author":"somen14","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you Gail,Should I go for RNA along with cd4 count?Recently I have lost remarkable weight.I am displaying every symptom of esophageal thrush.Sometimes difficulty of swallowing not always,weight loss,sometimes pain in throat which is a clear sign of immunodeficiency.But my doctor denies the idea.He examined my throat and said it's an allergic reaction.I'm loosing my mind.","resp_content":"Reply\nsomen14\nover 2 years ago\nGail please\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nNO.\nReply\nsomen14\nover 2 years ago\nGail,I am loosing weight without any obvious reason.I don't feel difficulty of swallowing when I eat but sometimes I feel pain and something stuck in my throat.Does it look like esophagus thrush?\nReply\ngeorgiagail\nover 2 years ago\nYour own physician has already examined you and told you what this has nothing to do with HIV.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/hiv-aids/6371/very-very-scared"},{"post":{"author":"kelvin3211232","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"In great anxiety! bottoming unprotected anal.

After showering prior to the session I managed to pop a pimple I had on my back with a towel. First, I lay on my stomach upon a towel-covered bed. As the sex worker prepared to apply the oil, she noticed I was bleeding from my back and announced that she was going to apply oil around that area and skip it. At a certain point she began rubbing her genitalia against my lower back(away from the pimple), after which I flipped on my back, at which point she proceeded to give me a handjob. I tried to stay on the towels that covered the bed, and I hope I managed. However, my primary fears are (1)that, while occasionally fidgeting, I might have somehow rubbed my pimple against that part of the towel which had come in contact with the part of my skin that had been exposed to her genitalia, and (2)the fact I noticed a rash of some sort on her neck(only, though I didn't look at her back).\nThat was 11 days ago. The very next day I started experiencing a general itch around most of the body. The following days(beginning from perhaps as soon as the second day)saw the onset of a headache and dull thuds in my ears. Perhaps there was also a scarcely noticeable increase in body temperature during this period to around 37C(98.6F), but I'm not so sure. On day 6, my doctor diagnosed it as a common virus(something he called \"Simby\"). By day 7 or 8 the symptoms seemed to be receding. However, later on during day 8 there began a worsening in the symptoms. That night saw an increase in temperature to above 37.5C(99.5F). By that time pressure in the ears has build up somewhat and a very low-intensity sneezing, running of the nose, and inflammation of the throat became just barely noticeable. Heartburn and nausea also began at around the 8th day. On the morning of 10th day I measured a normal body temperature, but during the day it went up again to slightly lower than 37.5C(99.5F). That day I also noticed a recurring pressure in the stomach area and where the liver is. I saw the doctor again that day and told him about a sexual encounter I was concerned about(without going into details), he realized I feared HIV and reassured me that it is most probably only a flu. Just to be on the safe side, he referred me to a general blood test. Finally, day 11 saw the onset of frequent watery diarrhea and pressure in the upper stomach area, right side. Temperature is 37.2C(98.96F). Whether or not I've noticed a rash, I honestly cannot tell(there are several suspicious, extremely faint blotches on my back and chest, but these are areas where I've always had pimples, plus this is mosquito season). The doctor said it was a rash. This is definitely no ordinary flew or stomach issue.\nIn light of this description, can my symptoms indicate HIV, and, also, what other illness with similar symptoms could I have caught there? I fear there was some sort of contact between my blood and areas that had come in contact with her genitals. Moreover, there was oil all around, which I fear might have served as a conduit. What can be transmitted that way with a similar confluence of symptoms except HIV?\nAny help will be appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Great fear of HIV, worrying symptoms","resp_content":"If you're so concerned, stop visiting sex workers.

He ejaculated in my mouth and I swallowed after 10 seconds or so. Although I know this is low risk, I am a bit concerned because I have rather large tonsils (not inflamed, they are just always pretty big) and do have bleeding gums occasionally. I had brushed my teeth 30-45 minutes prior to the encounter.\n\nAbout 48-72 hours later, I developed a severe sore throat and fever, with white spots on my tonsils. Went to the doctor and was prescribed augmentin, which resolved both the fever and the sore throat in ~24 hours or so.\n\nConcerned about HIV, I took an at home OraQuick Oral Swab test at 7 weeks (49 days exactly) and then again at 11 weeks (77 days exactly). Both were negative. I thought the 11 week test was being done at 12 weeks in the hopes of being conclusive but realized after the fact that I had miscounted by a week.\n\nIt has now been about 6 months since the encounter. I am only concerned because I continue to have what appears to be geographic tongue - lesions on the tongue with white borders that come, then heal completely for 2-3 weeks, and then come back in different places. They aren't painful, but do look pretty weird. Both my PCP and Dentist have diagnosed them as geographic tongue, which I know is a benign condition of unknown origin. What is weirding me out is that the appearance of geographic tongue aligns almost exactly with the oral sex exposure.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. If the sore throat was ARS, is it possible that it would have manifested so soon after exposure?\n\n2. If the sore throat was ARS, would the antibiotics have worked like they did?\n\n3. How confident should I be in the two tests I performed? I know I did not take them at the correct timeframe to be conclusive, but am a bit confused as to whether or not they have any validity at all given the times at which I performed them? It has been a bit confusing trying to determine when antibodies are present in saliva vs. blood. Do I need to test again?\n\n4. Is there any correlation between the geographic tongue lesions and HIV?

Exactly a week ago I was with an escort. I specify that I had no insertive direct relationship. My concern is that I rubbed my penis on the breast of the escort for a time less than one minute. My anxiety, then, is related to the possibility that a previous customer have come on the breast, and if that had happened, although there were no clear signs of liquid on the breasts, some microscopic residual can be entered in touch with my glans.\nThe other issue relates to the fact that the escort opened a condom and put it first on the bed, and after about ten minutes she inserted it on my penis to practice a masturbation. Here the question is similar to the previous one, namely: what if the condom entered in contact to any seminal fluids and / or blood and the latter can then be entered in contact with the condom and then with my glans???\nI would therefore like to know if these are modes of transmission of any infectious disease and especially HIV or hepatitis.\nI precise that since some days I feel a sense of burning in the foreskin of the penis and a feeling of constantly having to go to urinate, which happens.\nDear Doctor, please, clarify my doubts. Interests of clarity, I specify that the escort has even touched my penis without a condom, it is possible that she had dirty hands, and in this way gave me some sort of infections which among other things cause these my burning sensation??\nLast question, is it true that hiv virus dies outside the body and how much amount of viruses is need to happen the contagion, a drop would be enough?\nThank you so much, i really appreciate your work.","like_count":"0","tags":["Risk Factors","Possible Exposure"]},"responses":[{"author":"georgiagail","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: fears of hiv from indirect contact","resp_content":"There is no risk of HIV transmission from touching her breasts with your penis nor from a condom than touched a bed prior to being placed on your penis.

Hes crazy enough to take both their rent money and accuse me maybe hes crazy enough to inject me because he dislikes me when i never did anything wrong to him. Arm still feels bad.

Over 95 percent of newly infected individuals will have enough antibodies by one month (actually 25 days) post transmission to result in a \"reactive\" (positive) test result. By three months this has increased to 99.99+ percent.\n\nThus, a 1 month test result will give you an excellent idea of your negative status, especially if you cannot wait the entire three months (there's really little difference in the accuracy between these two time periods).\nGail\n1\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 3 years ago\nThank you for your response.

She is early 20's and appears clean and in good health. Her friend, a gay male, in the same age range, was with her.\n\nThe three of us ended up at my place. To make a long story short, they both performed felatio on me, I performed cunnilingus on the female, the female and I had unprotected vaginal and anal sex, and the male rimmed me. He also attempted to insert a finger or two into my anus but I stopped it as quick as possible. He and I did not engage in anal sex either way (though he might have rubbed his penis against my anus briefly, I am not sure if it was his penis or a finger but there was no penetration in that instance), and I did not perform oral sex on him.\n\nAlso, around five days ago, I developed a sore on the shaft of my penis from vigorous masturbation in the shower. A mark is still present but it appears to have healed over.\n\nAfterwards, the female said she has no STD's. The male said he is HIV negative which he knows from testing around 90 days ago.

Approx 8 weeks ago I was in Cape Town and went to a strip club. Genuine strip club - nothing else going on in there. One of the girls appeared to take a shine to me but I put it down to what goes on in those places. I got a dance and that was that, but she kept coming over. Extremely attractive girl and after way too much vodka, it was hard to resist. She asked about coming to the hotel, I said yes and one thing led to another, we ended up in my room. She did not ask for money at this point and we ended up having sex but it was unprotected due to the alcohol. The most stupid move I have ever made but it happened. I'm well aware that it is the HIV/AIDS capital of the world but still, somehow, went through with it. And I hate myself for it. I don't know if this girl was a sex worker or if she genuinely liked me. No money for sex makes me think, but I just don't know. If she was prepared to do that this night, how many other nights and with whom? There is a strong possibility I could have had unprotected sex with a sex worker in the world's biggest HIV hotbed. I believe I've stupidly taken the biggest risk imaginable here.\n\nWhen I got home from the trip, the anxiety kicked in massively. I made myself ill beating myself up and was very paranoid reading HIV info online. Eventually after a week, I calmed down and got on with life, knowing that I needed a test but that it may not show for 3 months so I was planning to hold off until that point. However, after 6 weeks I developed a sore throat and deep cough, which I still have. To me it feels far too coincidental so the anxiety is back. I have an appointment 4 days where I will be tested but it is beating me up badly in the meantime. Why I'm looking for advice is - does anyone know just how risky my encounter has been and is it more likely than not given my cough that I may have been exposed? I've looked into ratios etc - it's hard to say what the chances really are but right now I feel like a positive result is inevitable. It could be paranoia but taking into account the location, circumstances, my stupidity and this very deep cough developing at peak time, am I right to be paranoid? Any advice that can be passed on would be of great help to me.

Although I would disagree that Cape Town is the largest HIV/AIDS hotbed, but regardless, there is an overwhelming risk. And like you said, if she was this eager to have unprotected sex with you (a stranger) for free, how many other nights and with whom? Unfortunately, it is one of those things, where you did take a huge risk, and you are going to have to deal with the consequences of paranoia until you finally take the test and hopefully receive some good news that you are HIV negative.

I also want to commend you on practicing safe sex with your partner. I suggest that you continue to do so until you have an in-depth conversation with your doctor about ways to protect your partner from the HIV virus.\n\nLuckily, with modern medicine, there are developments in preventative HIV treatment. You should ask your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is commonly known as PrEP. This drug is used to prevent the infection in those who engage in high-risk sex. This news article ( http://wb.md/2dmXLTn) says that, \"during a year of taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), only two people out of more than 400 high-risk people became infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. And it seems that those who became infected didn't take the medication properly,\" the study said.\n\nThese are ground breaking developments, but only your doctor will be able to tell you if PrEP is right for you and your partner.\n\nPlease continue to be safe. Be sure to update us once you've spoken to your doctor.

At the beginning of the third round, we stopped and I ended up, in the heat of a moment, performing unprotected oral on him for no longer than two or three minutes. No ejaculation, pressumably no pre-ejaculatory fluids. At the time, I had what I'm assuming is a burn at the roof of my mouth that was healing after I peeled the little flap of skin.

Sometime I find little pain while urinating and sometime for days I feel ok. I do not have any discharge coming. No pus, no yellow or green fluid. Sometime I feel like something is coming from my penis but nothing comes. I do not have any symptoms like rashes or blisters. This thing happened when I had a much alcoholic consumption 1 week ago and the next morning I woke up with this feeling. Now the pain spread into my back. I have a joint pain issue from last two years but for the last week it got increased little bit. I thought it was UTI but I was do not have any symptoms like peeing again and again and continuous burning sensation. I got little etching but my skin seems to be clean. I also had a anxiety as soon I finished the intercourse. because I had a doubt that she had a STD. I started taking PEP withing 60 hours. The after 1 month back I tested for PCR DNA . which came out negative. I did a protected intercourse but I still doubt that I used it properly as it was my first time I had a intercourse irritated about the burning sensation in the tip of my penis. Pain is normal and bearable but sensation continues. I took advice of Urologist. There was no UTI infection .
