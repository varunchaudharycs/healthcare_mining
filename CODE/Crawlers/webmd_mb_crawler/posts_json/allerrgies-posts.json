Normally narcotic meds make my hands mildly itchy for several days once off of the meds. Initially, my palms and feet started to itch very badly and worse at night. I ended up taking Benadryl which helped for a day and then did not help anymore.\n\nI visited the doctor who put me on Prednisone. While on the meds, I did not have any itching. After completing the treatment, 3 days following the last dose my itching came back but was worse and more intense. My hands and feet no longer itched but my legs and arms started itching badly. I was put on another round of Prednisone which again stopped the itching. 3 days after the last dose the itching came back again and much worse. At this point, most of my body was itching. Strangely however, my hands and feet, scalp, face, and neck did NOT itch.\n\nI went back to the doctor and was put on another round of Prednisone for 12 days instead of 6-7. Blood work was done and my CBC and CMP were normal.\n\nAgain, Prednisone helped. Although the last few days on smaller doses it did not seem to help as much. I also noticed that I would then have sharp stabbing pains in ny palms but no itching.\n\nI ended up taking Gabapentin because my restless leg and insomnia were severe. This worked and helped the Prednisone as well.\n\nI just had another appointment. I still have extreme itching and no Prednisone is being offered.\n\nThis itching is driving me insane. I have no rashes, no dry skin, no blisters, no hives, no redness. More blood work was done. My CBC showed an elevated White blood cell count (20) but that's presumably from the Prednisone. My CRP and thyroid were fine. There were no allergy/inflammatory responses found.\n\nI have not changed shampoo, body wash, lotions, clothes, foods, or detergents. Water, heat, and cold make no difference. I even went so far as to get fragrance free and hypo allergenic. I have cats, but have had them for 8 years. The only consistent medication has been omeprazole daily. I do not take anything else.\n\nI am at a loss as to what this could be. A skin issue should show some outward signs but there is nothing. I was placed on Hydroxyzine and told to supplement with Diphenhydramine and Zyrtec. None of these are working at all!\n\nNext steps are referrals to Neuro (to check for auto immune and neuropathic causes). They want to refer to dermatology, but the patch tests and blood work were all negative for any of that.\n\nWhat could this be? And what can I do to offset the itching? I also tried Zantac/Prevacid as an H2 blocker. Nothing but Prednisone is working and they dont want to prescribe more due to its long term nasty side effects, unless they know the cause.\n\nWhat can I do on my end? Blood work is being repeated Friday. But, I am severely itchy and cant sleep or concentrate.","like_count":"1","tags":["Living & Managing","Treatment"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Severe Itching With No Visible Signs On Skin","resp_content":"\"Sounds\" like aggravated nerves likely caused by allergies or stress\n1\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Severe Itching With No Visible Signs On Skin","resp_content":"Have you considered the foods you consume may cause this kind of severe itching?

Since then I have a very strict and regimented diet. Between 100 to 110 grams of protein a day. I also eat very little carbs and almost no sugar and limited fat. Each meal contains no more than 10 grams of fat, 10 grams of sugar, and 10 grams of carbs at most. I have been trying since November to work on exclusion diet to take things out of my food to see what would happen. I've almost entirely eliminated gluten which made no difference. In June of 2016 I had my gallbladder removed due to gallstones as a complication of my bariatric surgery. I had no ill side effects other than what I believe to be some form of lactose intolerance. And it's very strange the way that it appears. Drinking whole milk and yellow processed cheeses tear my stomach up and cause bad gas pain and bloating. However if I drink one or two percent milk ( which I have been drinking 1% milk nine years after PCOS diagnosis). If I eat white cheeses such as mozzarella or parmesan then I have no issues. Some of that could be more from processing than the cheese itself. Kraft and Borden sliced cheeses affect me but the Sargento or Deli cut Cheese do not. Also even if I do drink milk as long as I keep it under half a glass I don't have much of a reaction there.\n\nDuring the time I was trying to lose weight I did everything from Weight Watchers to Jenny Craig to Atkins diet to a paleo diet none of which made a difference.\n\nI did come across a message board where some people who have had their gallbladder removed have had intense body itching. Basically since you don't have the gallbladder to store your excess bile it tends to excrete it's bile salts through Your Skin causing itching issues. That was done in June of 2016 and the itching started at the beginning of December 2016 which also makes me question whether thats a cause.\n\nDue to the nature of my weight loss surgery I have both a malabsorptive and restrictive digestive system. Because of this I have to be on a daily vitamin regimen to help supplement the nutrients that I don't absorb through food. I get my vitamin levels checked every 3 months and they have all been normal. Surprisingly my anemia and vitamin D deficiency are all now corrected. I also no longer have type 2 diabetes.\n\nAt this point, if I lose anymore weight then I am at risk of other issues. Also, on a side note I am allergic to most fruits and have always had to supplement vitamins to make up for that.\n\nI would like to note that Benadryl only helped the itchiness for one day and after that it never worked again. I went to urgent care where they prescribed me prednisone thinking it was some kind of allergic reaction whether atopic or otherwise.\n\nI have been put back onto prednisone because the itching came back again and even worse. At this point even the prednisone isn't working as well as it has in the past. I went out this weekend and bought new sheets and new clothes just to see if there could be an environmental issue. I stayed someone's house that did not have any animals and still itched.\n\nI do believe that some of this is in my head as far as it goes to the extent of the itch. I have been dealing with anxiety my whole life . But I have also been more depressed and more anxious at other times than this. Most of the time if I am out and about and walking around and being active then I either not notice it as much or am distracted by other things unlike when I am home alone.\n\nThe blood tests they ran were largely inconclusive. There was a cat dander test done which my result was equivocal. The levels go from unequivocal, equivocal, positive and so forth. Which means that my blood did react some to cat dander. I visited the vet and got a particular shampoos to use animals as well as a brush that would help get rid of that. This more so confuses me because I have had these cats for 8 years and have never had any problems nor do I exhibit the animal allergy symptoms. My eyes do not water, and my face and eyes do not get itchy. I do not have a runny nose or any type of drainage. My cats will literally sleep on my head or touching my face and I feel nothing.\n\nI am not sure if I had stated this last time but I have made no changes to home environments. The type of litter has not been changed, the detergent has not been changed since I make my own. All of my bathing products including body wash shampoo and conditioner are sulfate free and hypoallergenic. At this point I'm not sure what to do. I have been referred to a neurologist to rule out any neuropathic origin mainly because what I noticed with prednisone when it stopped being as effective was with taking Gabapentin which definitely helped. I also at the direction of my doctors added Zyrtec and Claritin on top of Benadryl. None of which works at all either. If I take a clonazepam then it doesn't help me enough to distract myself. They also prescribe me hydroxyzine which did not make any difference at all. I did get a new prescription for medicine called Doxepin which can help depression, anxiety, and uticaria. For me it has helped me to be able to sleep which is a godsend and sleep seems to be the only time that I do not itch. At first I was waking up in the middle of the night itching which prompted the prednisone.\n\nI am going to be seeing an allergist and dermatoligist. They already checked for scabies and bedbugs which were negative as well as being normal allergy markers . Again I have no rashes or blisters or hives of any kind I just get extremely itchy skin everywhere but my scalp face neck and private areas. And my skin does not have hives and it does not appear red either . I have however been under more stress lately due to losing a job and having to find another one which I have done so.\n\nTaking showers or baths do help for a limited amount of time. I have tried changing clothing fabric to see if I was allergic to Cotton or wool or spandex or polyester and nothing came of that either. I also change out all of my sheets and pillowcases and comforters every single day and wash thoroughly.\n\nThe only two things that occurred before the itching started would that I contracted bronchitis and took antibiotics for that in November as well as prednisone then as well. I also had my IUD removed in November as well and I went to my female doctor who assured me this should not cause the issue.\n\nIf for some reason it is an allergy that I could at least have a reason. But the problem would lie with long-term care since the normal allergy medicines like over the counter medicines don't work. No one wants to have me on Prednisone long-term because that can have its own side effects.\n\nI know that it is possible to develop allergies to things that you already been exposed to but I have had my cats for 8 years.\n\nAgain, I am lost. Any other ideas?\n1\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 3 years ago\nLet's see what the allergist and dermatologist have to say but if it were me, I'd also see a Hematologist for complete blood differential....some blood diseases cause severe itching and standard blood tests may not give the whole underlying picture.\nKeep posting and hang in....you've gone through a lot and many things happened concurrently or close in time.

I have gone to my dermatologist who believes it to be reynauds disease (since I have a weakend immune system), my PCP believed it was athletes foot and my RA doc doesn't believe it's of any significance. I had gone to my allergist for mild itching mostly on my back and legs prior and she prescribed me Hydroxysine and Singular, to which the side effects I'm not fond of ( haziness in the morning)so I stopped taking them. But with the feet I was in agony so Istart on those meds and then throughout the day I would stand barefooted on ice packs.

Swelling stopped. They prescribed me 4 pills 50mg prednisone for 4 days also. 10 PM that night hives came back in full force. I took 50 mg prednisone and fell asleep in chair woke up they were gone. Swollen hands returned to normal 4 days later. 2 weeks later my bloodwork showed white blood cells high were 10,300. Still having reactions to same poly but none of the other brands of poly seem to not bother me. Have allergist appointment nov 7th. Anybody have any idea what I'm reacting to on this brand? Doesnt seem like its color print coz other poly wrap has same colors. Although its blue and a case of dassani water I touched i broke out in hives but that only happened once.

Do you know much about liver injury or allergies? Want to shake up the day a little? I have a fun puzzle for you. :) Come down this rabbit-hole with me!\n\nBack in 2010 I started working in SE Asia, particularly Laos. Within 2 years (by 2012) I started getting mouth sores more often when eating citrus foods. So, I avoided them. By 2013, I was starting to have strange digestive issues. By 2014 I started down a medical rabbit-hole nightmare as I sought a diagnosis. No diagnosis came. It's 2019, and I still don't have a diagnosis (but I have a strong suspicion).\n\nMy LFTs are much more normal, but still my GGT is a bit high. I occasionally have strange food allergic reactions, but rarely nowadays (at least within the last 6 months). I sleep better, feel better, and think better. Better yet, I eat normal again. I only avoid a few things, and when I encounter them, I often either don't have a reaction or have a limited one. Things I wouldn't dare eat before, I can eat without issue. I'm cured, mostly (yes, I know you must be cringing now).\n\nLife is now good and has been for a number of months. The change? I moved to Stung Treng, Cambodia, and avoided veggies from the common market. I don't eat much with locals. I drink my own filtered water from a city supply. I didn't control the food, I controlled where it came from and how cooked it was.\n\nAt its worst symptoms included: rectal bleeding, vomiting/swollen throat, mouth sores, burned tongue /sore mouth/peeling skin in mouth while eating, severe lethargy, consistent long duration sleeping (12+ hours per night, not feeling rested), brain fog, emotional instability, inability to eat much in terms of fresh or home cooked food (processed food often didn't cause problems), abdominal pain/discomfort, lower back pain, and all kinds of other horrible things. Duration of symptoms lasting a couple days to 10 or more at a time, with cycles totally unpredictable. Yes, it was miserable.\n\nI attempted the whole fasting / removal thing to see if I could figure out a particular food trigger, lol. Look at the link below and see the results. You'll probably chuckle; don't feel bad, everyone else did too, including me.\n\nBelow this paragraph is the link for the food allergy blood test and the liver biopsy results. LFTs: GGT has mostly stayed in the 150-240 range (40 normal) for 7 years. Only once has it been less. ALT/ALP/AST ranged from normal to 80s-low 100s. Now they are effectively normal for more than 6 months. The food allergies stopped with the LFT normalization.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/TsuSttqhjZsR9iWW9\n\nI have done extensive testing - they ran out of tests (far more than included above). Do you enjoy reading dictionaries in your free time? You had better.\n\nInfectious disease, cancer, auto immune, fatty liver, diabetes, etc all effectively ruled out. I have all of the test results digitized, because such a crazy horrible experience must be documented, lol. I can share if someone wants to look.\n\nI have strong reason to believe my liver injury caused my food allergies. I believe my liver injury was due to chemical/pesticide exposure from either contaminated food or water. I believe that I have proof. Can you prove me wrong? ;)\n\nI've already stumped about 10 Drs, ranging from general to ID to GI to surgeons to just about anyone else I could make suffer. :)\n\nNext in line?\n\n(Enjoy!)","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Hives","Food","Allergy Testing","Treatment"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/101474/allergic-to-everything-a-fun-medical-puzzle-for-masochistic-doctors"},{"post":{"author":"senseiblackburn","post_time":"5 months ago","post_title":"Jock Itch Treatment","post_content":"Hello...can I use a topical cream like Lamisil and in between use an antifungal powder too?","like_count":"0","tags":["Treatment"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/101026/jock-itch-treatment"},{"post":{"author":"manukaadvisor","post_time":"5 months ago","post_title":"CHRONIC SINUS CONGESTION & ALLERGIES","post_content":"My grand daughter by age three had been hospitalized twice with bacterial pneumonia, not able to breathe through her nose at night, and toxic with allergies with Mom struggling to identify foods Kora could eat.\nWe used a medical grade manuka nasal spray to clear the biofilms of microbes from her sinuses.

I have had allergies to E numbers E221 - E228 since I was little. Many processed foods contain preservatives and these are basically different types of salts used to preserve the meats etc to stop them spoiling, enhance the colour and add to the taste. Too much sodium added to a food like bacon can trigger an allergic response. The sulphites break down in the body creating sulphur and you have an asthmatic respiratory reaction. It's taken me years to figure out why certain foods effected me, even when I thought they were safe. A poor diet (in my case even for one day) and then eating something with high levels of sodium (in the form of a preservative in a food like sodium nitrate) can make me swell, heart race, I become very alert whilst being drowsy and dizzy (it's a weird feeling like being drunk), feet swell, skin itches or burns sometimes and the list goes on.\n\nI add Himalayan salt to a lot of my food as this is generally a safe salt and you need salt to have a balanced diet and for hydration, but it's the times that you eat something with excess salt from a preservative that can trigger a response in my opinion and from experience.\n\nA lot of food companies now tend to hide preservatives and sugars in foods with creative names to make it look less processed.

They were mainly on my chest, stomach, sides, and back, with only a couple on my thigh, a couple on my arms, and one on my neck. These bumps would just be an itchy spot, which I would try not to touch, and would start to slowly turn into a small welt that looked exactly like a mosquito bite over the course of an hour, but within maybe 6 hours or less would completely disappear, looking no different than a slight pinprick, or long-passed pimple.\n\nThere were maybe two times that I had 6 or more bumps at a time, but typically they appear 1-3 at a time, spread out randomly, and mainly on my chest, stomach, or back.\n\nI searched absolutely everywhere for what I had though were possibly bedbugs, mites, fleas, etc. and even using a lint roller constantly on my couch, sheets, bed, carpet, everywhere, I never find a single bug, looking as closely as possible. I tried lint rolling on my body, checked my hair meticulously, showered and it would all be consistent, maybe 1 or two appearing every few hours and disappearing shortly after. From everything I've seen, the bumps I have are always much more mild than any reports on bug bite types.\n\nNow, I'm hardly getting any more bumps, today I got my first one since yesterday, which I only had one yesterday, but I have developed 3 rashes on my back, one on its own and disappearing, and two on my back currently. I also have two on my leg, one being on my inner thigh, and one on the outer thigh. They start as mildly itchy slightly to moderately red circles about the size of a dime, and over the course of a day, it becomes about the size of a half dollar, and usually around 36 or 48 hours later the center starts clearing, leaving a ring of slightly less red, more pink, typically not itchy skin.\n\nThis looks to me a lot like ringworm, and less like Lyme disease, but I don't know if it has any relation to the welts that I started with. Is that the beginning stage of ringworm, where it doesn't penetrate the surface, but once it does I start getting the rings?\n\nOn the rash that turns into rings, there is a hardly noticeable texture difference between the ring skin, the skin inside the ring, and the skin outside of it. Like I said, it hardly itches, and the whole rash from beginning to end runs its course in five days or less.\n\nI've been washing my sheets, clothes, and towel every night, applying a topical ointment, washing with tea-tree oil, and ensuring that I don't itch anything at all.\n\nAs one last side note, for as long as I can remember, the back of both of my heels have very dry, very hard skin. It's cracked, but only on the dead skin that has built up, it has never bothered me, but if I try to file it off, it's smooth for a week and ends up coming back. It seems to me that this is a minor case of athlete's foot, again not as bad as pictures I've seen, but I know athlete's foot is in the same fungal family as ringworm, so I'm wondering if this is related as well.\n\nThe first attached image show's the bumps/welts/bites at their worst, and this only happened once. Like I said, it's only a few at a time typically.\n\nThe second picture is the beginning of the rash, on Saturday at 4pm. I'm not sure how long it had been there, could have been anywhere between 1 and 6 hours most likely.\n\nThe third picture is from that same rash 45 hours later, Monday at 1pm,\n\nThanks for reading, and let me know if you have any more questions.","like_count":"0","tags":["Hives","Allergy Testing"]},"responses":[{"author":"mathewparadis","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Bug Bites / Ringworm?","resp_content":"These bedbug bites will leave red rashes of different sizes and be itchy and it is very difficult to identify.

He was 100 percent better the next day. Now I wasn’t feeling to good this next day. I felt like I had to poop but I was legitimately peeing. It was like every 10 minutes. I had never experienced anything like that before I was like oh it’s just the food being different. Everything at our hotel was filtered, so I wasn’t too worried. On our way home from Mexico, April 11th, all of us were literally s***ing our pants because we finally had American food. Our bodies were adjusting.\nFor the next month my stomach wasn’t right and it hurt so bad where I would have explosive diarrhea, perfuse sweating ( I would need a change of clothes) and horrible stabbing stomach pains. I would just cry because it hurt so much. I finally go to a GI and they sent me in for all the tests when you reach 50 years old... this is all over the time frame of a year so now we are in 2016...\n\nAll my tests came back negative and I was pissed because I’m like how the F*** can’t they find anything wrong with me!!!

Animal lover really, but dogs ard the only animal i'm not allergic to (or so i thought) so that's the only type of animal i can be around. I have a dog at home (for 9 years now) but since i'm studying away from home i don't see her much. So naturally i go 'awwww!!' Over every dog i see and praise myself lucky whenever i get to cuddle one. The other day i met a lovesick puppy (very loveable bulldog) on the bus making a racket trying to get to me for cuddles. Naturally i go over, sit down by the pup and try to quiet it down, since the owner is busy on the phone and the pup is pulling his leash and staring at me and whining. Licks all over my face and tries to jump into my arms, paws at my face in the process, for several minutes until i have to get off the bus. Totally made my day, who doesn't enjoy some puppy love? But just a few minutes later, while i'm walking home, my face starts itching, and it just gets worse. Pretty soon it's burning and stinging. When i get to the nearest mirror my face looks like i used poison ivy as a facial scrub. It takes an hour and three thorough washes for the stinging to go away and the angry red welts to vanish, but now the rest of my day is a nightmare. That was very obviously an allergic reaction. In all my life i have never had an allergic reaction to any dog, not even a little sneeze, and it's not like i haven't been petting other dogs every few weeks. It was entirely out of the blue. But the strange thing is i got no other symptoms than the burning itchy spots where the dog licked. No watery itchy eyes or clogged nose or full-body itching or breathing problems, and it went away with water and soap. Any other day my allergy attacks last for hours, and i usually have symptoms into the next day. The following day i decided to test... the puppy had nibbled at my gloves, so they should be full of allergens. I rubbed the gloves thoroughly on both my wrists, since wrist skin is some of the most sensitive on the body. I'd definitely welt up again if i was allergic. But nada, no red welts, no mad itching, no burning or stinging. I promised myself i'd pet the next dog i saw and see if i could provoke a reaction (as i'm going home to my own dog in a few days i want to know if i need to bring my heavy duty medication or not.) Today i met another puppy (this one a bulldog too if species matters, but just a few weeks old, wee tiny little adorable thing). He was very eager for cuddles and i consciously let him lick my hands and wrists, then proceeded on my way, careful not to wipe any off. It sounds disgusting, but i had to find out if it would provoce a reaction and it taked a few minutes. I waited half an hour... still nothing. My first encounter with the loveable puppy had provoked a quite noticeable reaction in just one or two minutes. I rubbed my hands on my cheeks and throat just to be sure... still nothing, so i washed off thoroughly. More 'testing' will ensue but... has anyone ever heard of something like this happening, or experienced it themselves?

I thought I would drop my thoughts down hoping it would help. First I wanted to ask your ages as hormone I'm balance can cause this and it would not be checked on a CBC Panel (blood work). Anything that has to do with the nerves in your body such as Fibromyalgia can cause this. If you have Fibromyalgia which is very hard to diagnose your nerves in your body can be highly sensitive. All Auto Immune Disorders have a side effect of itching from head to toe which is my problem. A Rhumatologist is the doc you want to see for Auto Immune Disorder testing. I have APS syndrome diagnosed at 20 now about to turn 45 and not one symptom other than 2 miscarriage untill 2 months ago. Also anxiety can have a side effect of itching mild to severe. If you don't drink enough water a day your body can itch. It's actually a very common side effect to many things. Allergies period seasonal or nonseasonal can cause itching. Having oily skin or dry skin can cause this. I hope you find your answers and resolve your itching as I know how you feel. Try yoga or some meditation to relax. Your body can be thrown out of wack by the slightest of things. I hope this helps and I think I listed everything I could think of to help.

This is my first post, and it’s going to be pretty lengthy as I want to be as thorough as possible, so please stick with me.\n\n***Please please PLEASE be aware: I suffer from a very debilitating case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Please do not say anything alarming to me or just half-hazardously throw ideas out there. I am very much likely to take whatever you say and obsess over it for months on end.***\n\nBack in May of this year I had a laceration on the back of my left hand. I’d never had one before. I went to the emergency room and the doctor glued it shut. My nurse—who I BEGGED not to scare me, as medical concerns of any kind are my WORST nightmare—scared me absolutely senseless. She told be about an infection called cellulitis that, if bad enough, could be fatal. So knowing me, I studied up on the subject.\n\nFast forward a week later. My laceration had healed, no problem, but my hand was swollen to three times its size and itching like ants lived under my skin. My doctor diagnosed me with atopic dermatitis, reacting negatively to the glue or the surgical tape that had closed my wound. They weren’t sure which. They pumped me full of steroids and sent me on my way.\n\nPresent day... now my palms and my arms seem to be having a very mild form of this same reaction to any bandage adheisives.\n\nI’ve been wearing bandaids all over for a week. First off, I had a horrible reaction to some mosquito bites about a week ago. I covered them with Neosporin and slapped bandaids on them. But now because of the itching I had feel like there’s more sores. Mind you, there’s no open bloody sores. Only cracked skin like you would see from itching or dry skin. The bandages I’m sure are further irritating that. I’m scared to take them off because I’m terrified of that cellulitis horror story, and I’m scared to keep them on if I’m making the skin worse. I have had bandaids on my hand and arm as well—those have been removed, except for one on my finger. My finger doesn’t seem to be affected, but my arm and especially the one that was on my hand seems irritated far worse than anything going on with my leg. My leg just looks like dry skin, a little pink (like you would see from having a bandaid on, period). But the hand and arm you can see exactly where the bandaid was placed, as there’s a prominent red outline of it having been placed there. It’s not warm or hot or itchy or painful. Or even raised. No bumps. Just red.\n\nMy doctors are sick of me, because I’ll be honest... this OCD over my health makes me unbarable to deal with. I need to know what’s going on. I don’t know if it’s safe to take my bandages off my leg. If there’s ANY cracked skin I’m terrified, as I’ve read you can contact cellulitis through just a crack and the most common place for it happening is the lower leg, with obesity being a risk factor—which I’m overweight. I’m just scared and want answers on what to do. I don’t know what will make it better or worse. Bandaids or no? Can anyone give me any information without scaring me??? I don’t know what to do and why I seem to have a sudden bandaid reaction I never had before since the laceration incident.\n\nEdit: There is occasional itching on my leg, and I will NOT use Hydrocortisone cream. Vets and the pharmacy said that could be dangerous to house pets, so with my OCD I just can’t bring myself to use it. My doctors have also suggested in the past that I not used antihistamines because they can possibly raise your heart rate, which sends me into panic attacks.","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Treatment"]},"responses":[{"author":"donnabwhitley","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Question about bandages, dermatitis, skin reaction","resp_content":"Have you tried colloidal dressings?\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/62786/question-about-bandages-dermatitis-skin-reaction"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Odd bite marks after sleeping.","post_content":"Last night I went to sleep and awoke to a serious itch.

I had balloon sinuplasty today. I have suffered from chronic sinusitis since I was a child and just learned of the balloon sinuplasty this year. I went to a local ENT at the recommendation of a coworker. They did a CT scan and noticed that my passageways were very narrow and said I would be a candidate for surgery. After fighting battles with insurance and paying an ungodly amount of money in copays I finally got my surgery scheduled. I wasn’t nervous as I had done a lot of research and heard that it wasn’t painful. Turns out.... IT WAS! The doctor came in and looked in my nose and asked if I had used Afrin as asked beforehand.. I had but apparently not close enough to surgery time so i was a little congested. He seemed annoyed and threatened not to do my surgery. He placed some afrin swabs in my nose and let them sit and then opted to do the surgery. I was given no sedative. They simply sprayed numbing spray and inserted some gel. When they went in and did the balloon, it hurt so bad I was hysterically crying. I was not nearly numb enough for this to be happening. They were able to do 3 of the 4 passageways but it was absolutely unbearable. After the surgery, my head had a dull headache but the pain medication has helped with that. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with the balloon sinuplasty as far as pain goes. I was really upset with the whole process and the way the surgery was performed. I am hoping that I won’t have any problems moving forward.","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Treatment"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/57294/balloon-sinuplasty"},{"post":{"author":"duvtm","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Eczema since an infant & severe skin allergies","post_content":"Any tips on a kid with severe eczema that is allergic to nickel vitamin e food coloring, lanolin, formeldhyde, dust, trees, cobalt, & yes salt bothers him around his mouth but I think that is due to skin sensitivity.

As soon as something containing a tree nut enters my mouth, I immediately go into anaphylaxis. I don't even have to swallow it.\n\nMy first time having an allergic reaction wasn't horrible. I ate one of those round chocolates with the walnut at the center. It felt as though I had suddenly gotten the flu. My throat got itchy, my tongue swelled a little, I felt overheated, I got sweaty, and looked really pale. It wasn't that bad.\n\nMy second one was awful. I was 4 (I think) and was at a friend's house. Her mom had baked cookies (with some sort of nut, obviously) and I asked if I could have one. She gave me a cookie and as soon as I bit into it, I felt my throat closing and spat out the piece that I had bitten off. I didn't even swallow it. I started struggling to breathe, coughing, wheezing, got very lightheaded, and my face was pale as a ghost. Luckily, my mom was still there and she took me to the hospital. They were able to get me feeling better and diagnosed me with a nut allergy and prescribed an epi-pen in case this were to happen again.\n\nI was extremely careful with what I ate after that and I've never used the epi-pen. Didn't even cook anything with nuts (I really enjoy baking and I'm pretty good at it. By the way, I can touch and be around nuts with no issues. I just can't eat them. I do get itchy when I use shampoo and skin creams with nuts, but it's no big deal). However, there were a few occasions when I've had a reaction.\n\nThe third time I had a reaction was when I was 15 and ate a cookie that had been accidentally contaminated. It didn't usually contain nuts, it was just a manufacturing error (so I guess those \"made in a factory that also produces___\" warnings do matter. Who knew, right? Haha). My throat got itchy, I felt feverish, and I started feeling my airway constricting. I didn't have my epi-pen on me, so I drank a ton of water and I started feeling better. I didn't die, I didn't stop breathing. It was weird, but I was happy that I figured out how to stop it from escalating. I thought that maybe it was just because it wasn't contaminated enough to kill me. Either way, I was lucky.\n\nI was even more careful after that and never had another problem involving nuts (I did develop an allergy to shellfish, dog saliva, and latex though). Earlier this evening, my dad offered me a piece of chocolate (orange flavored chocolate). I ate all of it. He read the label afterwards because I commented that it looked like there were pieces orange peel in it because there were light colored bits (like maybe that's what gave it the orangey flavor. Wasn't orange peel). It turns out that those were actually thinly sliced almonds. There were a lot in my piece, so I knew that the chocolate I ate had almonds. I had no symptoms, no reaction at all. That was several hours ago and I still feel perfectly fine. Well, as fine as someone with flu can be (I've had it for 2 days so far). What I meant was, I feel the same as I did before eating it.\n\nSo do I not have the allergy anymore? Did I outgrow it? I'm currently 19 years old and like I said in the beginning, I got the allergy when I was very young and it seemed to be very severe. When I got the test done to see which nuts I'm allergic to, I tested positive to all of them except English walnuts and peanuts. The doctor said all those years ago that I would never outgrow it. Was he wrong? Do I not have the allergy now? I'm glad that I didn't have a reaction today, but I'm kinda confused now.

If you do have severe pain in your sinuses, or persistent purulent nasal discharge, this may indicate a bacterial infection that needs to be treated adequately( time, dosage, and bacterial sensitivity) to prevent recurrence.\nFor a blocked nose it is not advised to use local nasal decongestants(ex otrivin, neosynephrine etc..) for longer than 3-4 days in a row because longer use periods result in “rebound phenomena”( more severe obstruction) upon discontinuing them. That is why local nasal steroids are recommended first place, and if needed local antihistamines. In more resistant cases systemic antihistamine are used, and rarely oral steroids.\nIf a pollution source at your work place is deciphered try using masks to minimize inhalation.\nFinally a v important immune defense front that is often underestimated, is your gut flora which is only revealing its impact on every aspect of a human body health. Do not eat refined sugars and food, or excessively salty snacks, take more fibres, nuts, vegetables, beans, especially drued fruits( with no sugar added), and fish.

Docs put me on two rounds of different antibiotics and finally felt better. They also told me to start using Flonase as well.\n\nSo shortly after caught another cold and then started developing really bad ear pain.\n\nThat went on for 3 week's. Went on Augmentin after 2 1/2 weeks of dealing with the pain. It helped a little. Went on for another week.\n\nI saw an ENT who said hearing is good, pressure is good, and no fluids in the ear's.\n\nSo two weeks passed caught another cold. Then week later ear pain. 2 weeks in dealing with the pain. I stopped taking Flonase think that somehow correlates with the tube issue's.\n\nFluid sensation is gone. Now it's just a throbbing pain. Also a sensation that my tube in my ear feels like it's throbbing.\n\nTried Sudafed and Advil first 2 days helped a little. Then just Advil and last 2 days just Asprin. Asprin does seem to help.\n\nAlso now not on Sudafed I am sneezing more that relieves some pressure as well.\n\nHowever, pain is still there and causing tooth pain. As well as similiar symptoms are starting to appear in my right ear.\n\nOn top of that feeling tired more than normal, ear's are itchy, lot more wax being produced, and ear's are red at times.\n\nDebating to go to the walk in clinic tomorrow. Now a day's Doc's are strict on giving out biotics.\n\nI know when I was a kid there was one year for 4 to 6 months my mom mention had really bad allergies and colds. That led to ear issues and the Doc prescribed me a low dose of Augmentin over the course of those few months.\n\nI feel if on another 5 days with the previous Augmentin think it would of cleared up the issue. My biggest concern is will the Augmentin still even work now.\n\nAny feedback or advice appreciate.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/32456/antibiotic-for-eustacian-tube-issue-s"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"eczema on face","post_content":"Hi,\n\nI've been having a problem with eczema on my face very regularly. i was prescribed a cream but it just comes right back after i stop using it. my skin is always itchy, red, sore and flakey. is there any other way I'm able to control this as it is becoming very bothersome.

Unfortunately, I don't really think there's a way to permantly cure it. I say drink as much water as you can to stay hydrated because that aids in skin hydration quite a bit. Also continue to use the creams for it, especially before you go to bed. Some good over the counter stuff I use include hydrocortisone cream, aquaphore, and unscented heavy duty moisturisers meant for sensitive skin. I use them regularly on my face and sine then my eczema has healed and my skin looks almost normal. I did try to cease doing so, but the condition rapidly came right back and I was back at square one. All I can say is to give your skin extra attention and love when it comes to moisturising and avoid wearing foundation if you wear makeup. Also, use baby oil and water to remove makeup (again if you wear makeup). Makeup removal tends to strip moisture from skin and dry it out even when it's the hydrating kind. Baby oil works just fine in replacing it and in my opinion works better, plus it adds more moisture to your face, which doesn't hurt if you have eczema. Now that said, do NOT use baby oil as a moisturizer in itself and if it get on your face then you have to be sure that you give your face a good scrub after using it to remove makeup. It makes your skin really oily. Oh! Baby lotion is also a really good moisteriser by the way. I wish you the best of luck and don't get discouraged.

It could be a couple of things - hives itch, and can come out just because your body creates too many histamines. Try some cortisone cream, and Benadryl, and see if it helps. It may be autoimmune reactions within your body. At one point, I was taking Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra, and Benadryl to get it to go away! Often if your immune system is overactive, you may see the info written above. One thing I learned, is that often when you have one autoimmune situation going on with your body, there may be more too.\n\nThere is another situation that I just found out about called Lichen Planus. Very similar to the above. They don't know what causes it, and it is also in the autoimmune category. This itching is so bad, like a bug bite, that you itch it until it stops. This often leads to scarring, because you itch until it bleeds. A dermatologist can diagnose this. If you seem to get ulcers in your mouth and it feels like you drank hot coffee and burned your mouth, and then other times it is fine, Lichen Planus also can occur in your mouth. The dermatologist can prescribe you some ointment or cream to put on your body if this is what you have. Your Dr can also prescribe you a mouthwash that keeps bacteria away, and a numbing mouthwash as well as a mouth paste to help with this. Dentist also have an item called Rincinol that is also used to help with your mouth.\n\nNot sure if either of the above are what you are dealing with, but I know that it took me a long time to get to this point!

I was overweight, living a sedentary life and taking in way too much sugar. The allergic reaction started a cascade effect, causing random hives to break out every couple of weeks. My condition rapidly worsened to the point I was continuously on antihistamines, so I wouldn't suffer. Once the antihistimines wore off, I'd immediately break out in hives again. Adding insult to injury, my allergist ran a panel of tests and told me I was diabetic.\n\nAbout that time, I started learning about the benefits of long term (3+ day) and intermittant (1 day) fasting. Apparently, a long term fast can do the equivalent of a biological reset of your immune system. The missus wouldn't let me do that, so I did intermittant fasting, one day a week. The results take longer to achieve, but I eventually got to the point I could finally get off the antihistimine. As a bonus, my endocrinologist told me that my AC1 levels are low enough that I'm considered prediabetic now. Finally, I've lost over 40 lbs, which goes a long way towards improving my health as well.\n\nAs far as hive outbreaks, I haven't had one since.

I am a 36-year-old female with multiple food allergies and a history of seasonal allergies and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nSince roughly November, 2016, I started noticing that I would randomly become very itchy. The itching starts at maybe my foot/leg, ears or arms/hands and spread throughout the day to my torso, back and basically any other part of the body you can think of. If I take loratidine OTC 5 mg., this will calm the itching temporarily. Within 48 hours of taking the pill, the itching returns. My allergist originally diagnosed me with dermatographia, but the itching seems to begin regardless of whether or not I have been touched, scraped or bumped by anything. It will occur randomly, as I sit at my desk at work, or watching tv. But it will also occur if I'm exercising. There is usually no rash, except for bumps that come from my harsh scratching response, and I usually bruise myself from scratching so much and so hard.

My son was not allergic to these foods, the doctor said, but molecules from specific foods were sufficiently similar to things he was allergic to, to cause an allergic-type reaction. It sounds like you're having this allergic-like reaction. But I no longer recall which foods cause this \"synergistic\" reaction and what non-food items they are linked to. If you were my daughter I would definitely take you to an allergist for testing. It's possible you will never have anything more serious than itchy throat.

I am a health scientist who lives in Baltimore and I have suffered from severe allergies and sinus issues my entire life. After years of being referred to specialists after specialists, I was finally referred to an amazing ENT / Allergist / Head and Neck surgeon at Johns Hopkins. I thought I had read and knew all there was to know about allergies but she really does know everything!\n\nSo first, if the hives develop during the night, could you be allergic to your laundry detergent? I use Tide Free (no dyes or perfumes) and wash my sheets in hot water every week. Also, are you certain they are hives and not bug bites? I hate to say that but I know my specialist has diagnosed 'bites' rather than 'hives' too many times to count.\n\nSecond, take a shower before you get into bed to wash off any allergens you may have picked up on your skin or in your hair throughout the day.\n\nNext, if you are taking 2- 24 hour Zyrtec in the AM, try taking one in the AM and one in the PM before bed. It is not necessarily true that taking a double dose will help and may actually not be the best course of action. Regardless, allergist always advise taking Zyrtec in the PM and this may help reduce the chances of developing hives overnight.\n\nAbout your wrist pain, I have actually had severe wrist pain during times when I have been taking larger than normal doses of prednizone and eventually developed a ganglion cyst. This type of cyst has also been associated with severe Vitamin D deficiency, which I have, and is also caused by prolonged use of cortisol-steroids (I take 3 different cortisol-steroids including a low dose prednizone). You may want to talk with your doctor about a nasal inhaled option with less side affects. I have been prescribed Nasonex nasal spray and Pulmicort inhalant for years. Both have less side affects than systemic cortisol-steroids such as prednizone. A vitamin D supplement may help as well.\n\nFinally, have you been referred to an allergist for allergy testing? You have to know what you are allergic to so you can avoid it. The skin test will require you to be off of all allergy medications for 7 days prior to testing. That was not possible for me so I was referred to Hopkins for a blood test. More allergy specialists offer this option now, a decade after I was referred.\n\nAnd of course, please talk to your doctor about any of my suggestions before making any prescription medication changes. And if you weren't getting the help you need, please try another physician. A knowledgeable specialist can make all the difference.\n\nMy best~\nLisa\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/18742/new-to-hives"},{"post":{"author":"banderloon","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Allergic reaction in right foot to pond algae","post_content":"For over a month, the toes on my right foot have become tender, swollen, red and stiff.

Should we just leave it alone? We've been told conflicting answers between 2 visits to the ER and can't find anything definitive on the web.\n\nHistory:\nMy wife was given a Tetanus shot 4 days ago and within 24 hours began to experience a lot of swelling and discomfort. We went back to the Dr's office and was told by a nurse that this is an allergic reaction to the compounds in the tetanus shot and happens from time to time. She suggested icing it and drew a line around the swollen/red area.\n\n24hrs later, it spread about an inch past the line so we went to the ER. They told us this is not an allergic reaction but a staff infection due to poor treatment or preparation of the injection. Sounds like a professional way to say dirty needle to me but I could be wrong. They gave another antibiotic treatment via shot to help kick the keflex in faster and again said to keep close eye on the site and return if it worsens. They also said to use cold compress on it.\n\n24hrs later, it has seemed to subside then return very angry and we went back to ER, this time was told Keflex was not a good choicde considering my wife's background with her auto-immune diseases and prescribed Doxycycline and said no, never use ice on infection and instead use heat to bring more white blood cells to the infected area.\n\nI've searched and searched online and so far have only found a few mentions of applying heat to cellulitis, mostly in bodybuilding, derma/skin health type forums but nothing that would tell me that applying heat to cellulitis is indeed the proper accompanying treatment while taking antibiotics. I don't want to make a bad situation worse if heat is not good, as of now we are just leaving it alone, no heat, no cold. If anyone can point me to where I can find the answer definitively it would be greatly appreciated.

Sometimes it's a relief just to have a name for whatever is overwhelming you. Then you might want to read up on helpful hints for non medically treating other skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis and then try these on your self. One thing is to put an ice pack on the area that's driving you crazy, leaving it until the cold makes the skin numb, about 15-20 minutes. You can try warm -- not hot -- baths with Epsom salts in it. Allergy testing probably won't be any help but I'm not a dermatologist so you might ask yours about that. I mention this mainly because my own skin problems are not caused by allergies per se, but a lot of the creams, lotions, and ointment I tried had ingredients that I'm allergic to (including some very expensive prescription ones). One of my cousins has had various skin issues throughout his life and to help control the urge to scratch, he slaps the itchy area. This might not be the best tack for you to take but it might be worthwhile talking to your doctor about it. If your doctors aren't helping much, you might try asking the nurse at the doctors office. My experience has been that they know a lot more about home remedies. In any case, keep returning to doctors and good luck!\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Welts and itching all over","resp_content":"I have chronic hives that causes welts like the one you display.

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )\n\nFirst Steps:\n\nDoctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist\n\nDermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him.\n\nDoctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life.\n\nNaturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning.\n\n\nThis is a list of the following things we have done to try and treat the condition:\n1. Mastocytosis Disease - low histamine diet & Stinging Nettle Tea, Quercetin SAP.\n2. Low histamine diet, B12 injections, & NAC SAP Antioxidant, Cyto-Calm to help with my sleepless nights.\n3. Liver Cleanse - Live SAP & Chelidonium Plex drops\n4. Parasite Cleanse - Garlic Activated Principles, Berber, Black Walnut, OIl of Oregano\n5. Going off birth control (Nueva Ring) - I was on Yasmine from age 16 - 20, went on Seasonale for about 1 year - went off the pill for 4 months - went back on to yasmine for about 1 year - swtiched to Nueva Ring, on it for approx. 6months) She has given me Femco & Chaste tree to help with the symptoms.\n\nI have been off the Nueva ring for about 1.5 months now. I got my first period normal timing. Since then, my symptoms have increased, and I have scabs all over my shins, now starting to my thighs from itching my skin so hard. Symptoms seem to be worse with clothing on. At work I get hot flash symptoms. I have been consistently waking up at 3am and having trouble falling asleep for the last 3-4 months now. Often wake up in a cold sweat. When I exercise, and sweat my scalp becomes incredibly itchy almost stinging sensation.\n\nMy libido is non-existant, and the irritability from itching doesn't help.\n\nIf anyone has any insight on something I can try, if you have experienced similar things etc. please help.","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Hives","Allergy Testing","Treatment"]},"responses":[{"author":"nvhtaxlady","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Extreme itching / crawling sensation for almost 2 years no signs of rash or treatment","resp_content":"Are you on any medications for pain?

I used to suffer with hives for years without knowing what was causing it. It's such a miserable affliction! I finally figured out I'm highly allergic to soap...all soap and shampoo! Even all natural, organic soap or shampoo will cause me to break out and itch like I'm on fire if I leave even a tiny drop of it on my skin, or fail to rinse thoroughly. I tell you this to make the point that it could be something you are around, do, or are exposed to every day, but only occasionally have enough exposure to cause hives. And since it appears to be a seasonal thing, have you tried making a list of things you eat or are around during those times? I'm thinking strawberries, or maybe fresh greens that you don't get the rest of the year. It may be pollen from nearby trees. It could be any kind of pollen actually, even grass or garden pollen. If at all possible, get the allergy patch tests that will tell you what your trigger is. Yes, I know, Doctors like to say it's not an allergy, it's urticaria.

My first suggestion is to start over from scratch and see a dermatologist. It's possible that what appears to be hives due to an allergy is nothing of the sort. In my family there have been all sorts of allergic reactions but also skin problems like psoriasis, shingles, rosacea, seborreic dermatitis, eczema, lupus (SLE) and something that looked like hives appearing only when the sufferer got cold. If your hives are due to a systemic disorder like lupus, antihistamines won't help. If it's recurring shingles, steroids won't help. So put the skin expert to work!

My allergies have been present ( I woke up every morning with mucus, but would feel better after I'd cough it out), but now my mother's 2 cats (fully grown and long hair) have had to come stay with us for a bit while she looks for a new place. I have been living in pure hell since then. The only thing that has been even remotely helping the extreme amount of mucus that chokes me is Mucinex D, but I've been becoming light headed and fatigued since I've been taking it regularly, but again, it's the only thing that helps. I've tried many different allergy meds but to no avail.\n\nMy second problem now seems to be my breathing. Every night when I go to bed I've been having to use my boyfriend's inhaler, which helps slightly, but my throat is still tight and I end up struggling to breathe still. I'm afraid of taking a prescription that isn't mine, and plus mixing it with Mucinex D, I don't want to hurt myself.\n\nMy question is, has anyone else gone through this problem and found a medicine that helped? Do I need an inhaler? No one else can take my mother's cats, so simply not having 4 cats is not an option. Also, the two long hairs are in a spare room and my boyfriend is now the care taker of them in my place.

After two doses of that medication we have seen patches didn’t go and are swollen , that’s when we rushed to emergency. They looked at him and said it is some infection as he also had fever by that time they suggested Tylenol with Benadryl and sent us back to home they also said it can’t be amoxicillin as allergy wouldn’t take that much time to come out, they asked to follow-up with family doctor. They did a blood test and we found ERCS : 5.49 High (3.90-5.30), MCV 69.4 LOW (75 – 87) and MPV 8.3 LOW (9.0-13.0) these are only values which are not as per charts.

Helpline asked us to go to doctor in ER within 3 hours, that scared us and we went to ER, ER guys made us sit for some time and moved us into Acute care, there my son was administered epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl , latter slowly hives were coming down, we were damn happy, after 2 hours hives completely went away, I thanked God for this moment. We were moved into normal observation ward and asked to wait,\n\nWednesday\n\nEarly morning : I was sleepy and my son was on my shoulders sleeping silently, I noticed some uncomfortable moments in him, when I looked at him, he was all patchy on his face, his head was red and his tummy, back was full of hives, this time lot bigger then I have ever seen, I got scared and shouted out for nurse , they moved us back to acute care and gave another dose of epinephrine 0.1 ml + Benadryl, again same thing happened, but after 4 hours hives were coming back, that’s when staff in acute care called in pediatrician, he came after 2 hours, until then nurse kept wet towel on hives, once doc was in they grilled us down until his birth and they said my son is a tuff fellow, and gave him Advil + Benadryl, this brought down the hives, doc asked us to give steroids, (2 more doses) Advil once we go home that afternoon and give Claritin one dose a day until hives stop coming , after going home, we gave him Advil and with some gap gave steroid. After giving steroid, again hives came back with full power, and he looked like a patchy boy with half of his face full of patch, now I didn’t get panic, instead I took him to bathroom and gave a Luke warm water shower , to our surprise all the hives went way in minutes and he was my darling son again, he slept like a baby as he always did,\n\nThursday\n\nbut again at 3:00 am he wakes up and cries out in pain, now, I took him into bathroom, and applied cold water on parts where he is complaining, he again slept off , I came to my work my wife stayed back home taking care of him , I called my wife she said, now patches are coming and going but aren’t that dark anymore.

They prescribed me Tylenol with Codeine 325mg & Ibuprofen 800mg. After I began taking the pain meds (day one of pain meds & day two of Amoxicillin) I noticed that I was getting a skin rash and it was very itchy. Also, my upper lip began to swell. I made an appt with the dentist again but I continued to take all the meds because I was in too much pain & I didn't want to stop the antibiotic that was supposed to be helping the infection. My mom was worried so I stopped the Amoxicillin two nights before my appt. I went in to see the dentist and told him about the rash & that I was still in pain. I hadn't actually been taking the Tylenol too much because it didn't actually help with the pain. He prescribed me a new antibiotic assuming the allergy was from that. (Note: I've never had a reaction to a medication before). He gave me Clindamycin 150mg & told me to take 50mg of Benadryl for the reaction & OTC ibuprofen for pain (I was out of the prescription).

I personally have dealt with a lot of sneezing, a runny nose, excessive phlegm, and very swollen tonsils. One week was especially hard with my throat hurting very badly, so I went to visit a walk-in clinic because my primary care doctor is in another town.

I was put on medication for strep throat, which helped a lot except my tonsils never stopped being swollen. I went back to the clinic for this and saw I different doctor.

For years living in NY I have gotten debilitating allergic rhinitis for about 1-2 months depending, in September and October. I recently moved to TX and to my surprise it got much much worse! I didn't think this was actually possible. It is to the point where I really can't function (work, leisure, move around too much) because not only is my mind focused on the frustration of the symptoms but the actual physical symptoms themselves cause me to be constantly draining my sinuses, blowing my nose, sneezing etc. Not to mention when I am at work or with clients its extremely embarrassing and probably uncomfortable for others. This happens indoors and outdoors with no relief during this part of the season. I have tried literally everything from steroids to nasal sprays to perscription pills and air filters. The only thing I have not tired is the immunotherapy which is my current doctors \"final option\" she says, however its extremely expensive, needs to be administered year round, not covered by insurance, and she can't guarantee it will actually work. The only thing I have ever been able to take that relieves most of the symptoms is Adderall. Are there any doctors out there have done any research on this or tried it with their own patients? I know it would not be typical for an allergy specialist to prescribe this type of drug for the symptoms I have but it works. My doctor looked at me like a drug addict when I asked her about it. There are many other online communities out there with people having similar experiences with Adderall relieving their nasal symptoms.

Bandages with adhesive almost always cause a small reaction for me. I will normally use gauze and a small piece of self-sticking tape. For me, that doesn't usually cause a reaction, but it is certainly different for everyone. You should work with your doctor to determine what wound covering methods won't cause a reaction for you or your wife.\n\nHere is some information on combating common skin irritants that you may find helpful: http://wb.md/2czoUSK\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/243/allergic-to-band-aids"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Addie","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Exercising with seasonal allergies???","post_content":"This one is for all you fellow seasonal allergy sufferers out there. How do you continue exercising when your allergy symptoms are really acting up? I know I could always take my workout inside, but I really love getting outside and getting some fresh air after a day in the office (except when that fresh air makes my nose run and my eyes itch).\n\nThis article (http://symptoms.webmd.com/seasonal-allergy-map-tool/allergies-and-exercising-outside?page=1 ) suggests avoiding certain times of day if you’re allergic to certain things (e.g. Allergic to ragweed? Avoid early midday outdoor time) and picking the right exercise.\n\nI’ve taken to rinsing out my nose and washing my face right when I get home – it seems to help lessen some of my reactions – and checking the allergy forecast in my area before going out (this seasonal allergy symptoms map is a good place to start if you live in the US http://symptoms.webmd.com/seasonal-allergy-map-tool/default.htm).\n\nWhat do y’all do to help stay active during allergy season?","like_count":"2","tags":["Seasonal"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Riley","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Exercising with seasonal allergies???","resp_content":"I feel you WebMD Addie!
