The \"Heart Attack\" enzyme only stays in your system for an hour or two, so lab work done at a later time would not show this. An ECG only detects abnormalities in electrical impulses, and they would only show this if you had damage done to your heart. Case in point, heart disease runs on both sides of my family. All of my Maternal ancestors have died from heart attacks, so I should have realized this when I started having chest pains. But I though, no way, I'm only 46, this can't be happening. Well the pain started at 2:00 pm and by 10:00pm I finally went to the emergency room, I was still having a heart attack, for eight hours by now. When I got to the emergency room I was still having the heart attack, In fact I was still having my heart attack by the time I went in to surgery the next day at 2:00. Which would explain the reason they were literally running me to the emergency room while shaving my chest and leg and inserting IV's at the same time. Quadruple Bypass! My cardiologist tells me this it's rare that a heart attack lasts that long, but it does happen. After all that, I had no damage whatsoever. But here's the kicker, I had another one two years later and had two stents implanted. I have an ECG every six months and my Cardiologist says by looking at the results he would never know that I had a heart attack. My ECG's and stress tests are perfect. But back to the point, if these pains come on again, get to an emergency room immediately. Better yet, call an ambulance, they'll get there faster and be able to perform the ECG and specific lab results on the spot.\nTo be fair, there are other things that have very similar symptoms, GERD, lung cancer and yes panic attacks. I too have panic attacks and had to go on disability (and to be honest, I'd rather have a heart attack than more panic attacks). But none of these things come on so suddenly and with such pain as you described. Catch it in the act.

I never figured out why my heart was beating fast for the majority of that afternoon.\n\nAnother night my heart was around 100bpm while I was trying to fall asleep. I have recorded those bpm with the Apple Watch and showed them to the cardiologist. They said I'm fine. Of course I don't believe them.\n\nSome nights when about to go to bed I become cold to the point I am shivering. AC in the room 62F, outside 80sF. This is very worrying to me because then I feel like my heart takes a beating when this happens. I have to shut off the AC and take a hot shower to lower my body temperature. This has happened to me around 3 times in the past 6 months. The 2nd one was the reason I went to ER at midnight.\n\n\nVisit to ER and Cardiologist\nAfter 8hrs of waiting. They said I was fine and referred me to a cardiologist. Cardiologist gave me heart monitor for a week.\nThey were looking for those palpitations which I had to do a \"manual entry\" to the monitor whenever I experienced those and I did. But they said my heart was fine. I did recommended me to exercise and eat small portions. I had told them than some times I do feel fatigued and even have felt the palpitations after eating. I thought it was because perhaps I ate too much fatty food or something. They think it's related to eating large portions. But again these heart palpitations have happened to me even when I am sitting in front of my computer.\n\nI visited new primary doctor and told him about my recent events with my heart. He asked me some questions and after telling him that me and my wife are expecting our first baby he thought I was just anxious about it. And honestly it very hard for me to make that the cause of what's been happening to me. Yes, things will change when our baby is born but I don't even think about it too much. I'm not going crazy about it. I am happy about it and can't wait too meet our baby but I don't think about it 24/7. Is it really affecting me without me being aware?\n\nAround 7 years ago my old primary doctor told me my cholesterol was borderline high. I started exercising/moving more but have not been consistent. Back then I was having some asthma episodes triggered by dust mites. Those are not as present anymore but if I am exposed to dust or start running I may get asthma.\n\nThe heart situation have made me start researching about heart disease, heart attacks, high cholesterol, etc. Many doctors on YouTube talking about the dos and don'ts. Things to eat for a healthy heart. I have implemented some foods into my diet that are good for lowering cholesterol, help with arteries etc. Apple cider vinegar, turmeric, walnuts, lemon juice, raw honey among others.\n\nAnyway, I now constantly live with the thought that at any moment my heart will just stop. I try to not feed that thought of course but then I am reminded every time I get heart palpitation (not everyday ), it twitches/flutters (almost everyday now), or when I start shivering when going to bed, for whatever reason (doesn't happen often).\n\nI'm posting this not expecting a magic solution. Mostly to share my experience and get some feedback from some of you.

My stress level at work had increased since my financial situation was always tenuous being self employed, I had increased my work load outside of my comfort zone. My chest pain was excruciating and I thought I was having a heart attack while on vacation. I had had chest pain almost daily for a few months prior but this was the worst. I waited till I got home. Before seeing a doctor.\n\nThe first doctor a cardiologist did an EKG and a stress test. They stopped the stress test in the middle because my blood pressure was so high. The guy put me on monopril and said come back in a month. I asked why high blood pressure was giving me chest pains when it was the silent killer with no noticeable symptoms. He seemed unconcerned so I went to another doctor this time an internal medicine specialist. Same diagnoses. High blood pressure but no explanation for chest pains. So I went to another doctor. This time to another internal medicine doctor that actually talked to me for an hour the first visit and he was the one that diagnosed me with anxiety. He was the same guy that diagnosed me with IBS when I was 28 another symptom of anxiety.\n\n21 years later I have it pretty much under control. Once I realized it wasn't a heart attack or any other medical condition and went to work on controlling my stress levels and finding ways to deal with anxiety when the attacks almost always at night would come. Falling asleep was never a problem but staying asleep was. I had to learn to not allow my work problems home with me at night. I developed hobbies to occupy my active mind. I had to start exercising again. I was a runner in my 30's but constant injuries made it impossible to continue. My financial stress levels decreased as my kids grew up and left the nest and my business became more profitable. Do not underestimate the stress money issues have on you.\n\nYou just have to learn what works for you. Doctors like to prescribe anti depressants for anxiety but I would stay away from them if possible. There are other options. A glass of wine, a beer or two in some states other substances are legal. A Xanax may be all you need on occasion. I'm just saying anxiety is a common problem and there are many ways to deal with it you just have to find what works for you. Your doctor can help but at the end of the day you will have to find the right method to help control yours.\n"},{"author":"joburgange","resp_time":"6 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Heart problem or anxiety?","resp_content":"Hi Orpheus, I am not a man but have experienced similar symptoms. Three years ago, my heart would flop around in my chest like a fish, skip beats and start beating rapidly but faintly out of the blue. I have an excellent cardiologist by accident ... he was my doctor in the ER when I went in 13 years ago with what turned out to be a panic attack. I had panic attacks regularly throughout 2006. I was then 45 years old. He recommended that I visit a psychologist for a few sessions. He explained that I was probably in peri-menopause and that hormones can do weird things to one's body. He also said that new dietary additions could be a factor. I eat no processed food, drink only water, no caffeine, fresh veggies, little fruit and little red meat. I have always been of normal weight, get 8 hours sleep a night and never get sick. I had been a smoker, however, for 26 years. He admitted me for five days and fitted me with a halter to monitor my heart. Nothing. It was fine. Fast forward to 2016. I saw him again about my flopping heart, skipped beats, etc. He did an extensive blood workup and found that my B12 levels were in the basement. He specialises in women's health along with heart health and believes that most ailments are due to nutrition. He treats what he can naturally. He said that my adrenal glands were shot due to long-term stress (my husband died after a tramatic 10-year case of a rare dementia called Pick's Disease. It was extremely stressful for me as I was putting two kids through university on a below-average paycheck) and that my ovaries were now 'dead' so my hormone levels had gone over the cliff. He put me onto a B12 injection every two weeks, a Solal product called Burnout for my adrenal glands that I took every second day, vitamin D3 daily, Homocysteine-lowering tablets daily, DHEA hormone every second day, Flaxseed oil capsules daily and a tablespoon of chia seeds daily. ... I already took vitamin C and curcumin. I had just stopped smoking when I saw him and he warned that I would probably experience anxiety due to that, which I did. He said that the palpitations and heart flopping were due to my hormone levels having dropped. He went on to explain that 1 in 4 women die of a heart attack and that our hearts are at risk after menopause. My heart went back to normal fairly quickly after I started following his regime. I still suffer from anxiety but my heart is normal and my resting pulse rate is down into the 70s. What helped a lot with the anxiety was transcendental meditation for 20 minutes twice daily and going to the gym for 30 minutes daily. Meditation lowers blood pressure and heart rate and helps with anxiety, as does exercise. I can't recommend psychotherapy enough. Just being heard is the most healing thing.

I have been having palpitations/skipped beats for several years. I've had holter monitors, event monitors, stress test, labs, etc, which is how I was diagnosed with SVT. Last year I had a episode which resulted in a HR of 190 bpm. I was taken to hospital by ambulance. The EMT's administered Adenosine. I was put on Metoprolol which I have been on for the year. I continue to have palpitations, usually daily and several times a day. When I had my major episode last year, it started as what's been called benign SVT. Anytime I have palpitations, it feels my heart wants to take off again, however, luckily it hasn't gone that far. I was told I have an electrical issue which may result in needing an ablation. I have been told even with the ablation, the palpitations will continue, the procedure may only stop the electrical path from creating the fast heart rate. I have been told the SVT's are not of concern, however many articles I read state otherwise.\n\nI have been seeing my cardiologist and PCP for many years. I have even spoken to a specialist. When I tell them what happens when I'm having the palpitations, I'm sometimes met with odd looks or at least the Dr. not understanding as though I'm the only person who experiences my symptoms.\n\nMy question, or questions, are this:\n\n*Does anyone experience the need to burp when having palpitations? I don't feel a heartburn, however just prior to the palpitations and through the episode I burp constantly. It sometimes helps to burp but it almost seems part pf the palpitations.\n\n*Does anyone experience palpitations from certain positions. Mine can happen at anytime, however it seems they are more prevalent when I'm sitting, squatting, bending over. I've also noticed they can happen when I eat.\n\nMy way of life has changed due to these experiences. I was never a fast eater, however I've slowed way down in hopes of preventing an episode. I also used to sleep on my side which I have done all my life. Since the palpitations I can only sleep on my back. If I turn on my side this position can also bring on the palpitations. I've always been on the healthy side so to have my lifestyle diminish due to fears of bringing on a major episode as last year, is frustrating not to mention scary.\n\nHas, or does, anyone experience any of the symptoms I have described? I've tried so many times to get my dr's a better understanding of what happens however as I've stated I'm met with looks of confusion.

She has always had high cholesterol levels, but as time progresses her levels continue to increase. She has tried every cholesterol lowering medication on the market, aside from injections. We have had appointments with multiple cardiologists, but ultimately nothing changes. The last cardiologist did tests to rule out peripheral artery disease, because he suspected this was going on in her legs. The test came back negative, but he said that if she did not change things it would progress to that level. She is also a smoker and has had an extremely difficult time trying to stop. In addition to this she is not physical active, aside from walking around the house. She has severe back/ body pain and COPD just to add insult to injury. She also only eats one meal a day, by choice and usually the meal is unhealthy. The bottom line here is that she is in poor health due to her lifestyle, and the cholesterol meds have had adverse effects on her body. Her liver enzymes increased after taking Crestor to the point that she had to be taken off of the drug. I am trying to find something \"natural\" that will help her. I know fish oil has worked for people, I would like her to try that. At this point, I just don't know what dosage would do her good. I know she needs to stop smoking and become more active.

As a matter of fact one time I felt on my head having to go to the ER and got 6 stitches. This past January my condition worsen I could not longer run or even walk fast because I would loose my breath. I went to my PCP and he after hearing my murmur sound so bad sent me immediately to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. One to verify all was well with my lungs and immediately he recognized that my murmur had gotten much bigger. My lungs are perfectly normal. He immediately refer me to a well known Cardiologist who discovered after having done a heart cat and also did a test inserting a camera through my esophagus and discovered it had grown 3 cm on my Septum middle of the heart left ventricle creating an obstacle to the mitral valve and the aortic valve as well. The blood would come out of the mitral and it would regurgitate back into the mitral valve creating damage to those valves. This in turn caused me to be without air and do the basic tasks of life. I had open heart surgery on March 26, 2019. All went well with my surgery except I also have a Pacemaker since they had to shaved off so much of the murmur that my lower part of the heart does not pump as much as it should but that is one reason why they invented the Pacemakers. I am doing great now, I function perfectly normal still tire at times but to get rid of the anesthesia and secondary effects takes a good 6 months to a year.\nRecommendation see a cardiologist asap and try to get a heart cat and the other procedure done. This will tell him/her of the exact condition you are going through.

Complexly, POTS can be a low and high BP pressure problem combined.\n\nDuring a Tilt Table Test, some POTS patients have large drops in BP and pass out (syncope, temporary loss of consciousness, also includes fainting), while other patients have only relatively shallow/small drops in BP, or none at all.\n\n75% of POTS patients are female with a genetic tendency to be passed down from mother to daughter.\n\n\nDysautonomia Information Network\n\nPertinent snippets\n\nPOTS can be categorized as primary, meaning it is idiopathic and not associated with other diseases, or secondary, meaning it is associated with a known disease or disorder......\n\nPeople generally develop POTS after becoming sick with a virus, giving birth, or being exposed to great bodily stressors (i.e. surgery, trauma or chemotherapy). Some people have had POTS their entire lives. Teenagers sometimes develop the disorder during the years of rapid growth, and 75-80% of them can look forward to being asymptomatic when they reach adulthood\n\n.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD Member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nGeneral info/patient resources\n\nUMD Student Helps Mayo Clinic With POTS Awareness -\nHuseby wants to tell others about POTS.\n\nEven when POTS hit her the hardest during high school, she prepared a science fair project to explain the syndrome.

I am 69 but my heart started racing about 2013 as I was hurrying into church. I felt it pounding in my chest. Then it went away. Then a few months later I went for a 20 minute walk and I got a terrible headache. So I sat down and checked my blood pressure and it was 125/110 so I went to the ER and they did an echo test and said I had diastolic dysfunction stage 1 and they said a lot of people my age have that. I have had terrible anxiety my whole life. I’ve been rushed to the hospital with panic attacks and migraine headaches. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I also have the problem of my heart jumping up when I stand up just like you; then it might come down a little if I just keep standing and don’t start walking. I’ve had 48 hour heart monitors and 30 day heart monitors because I also have extra beats. My heart beats before the blood is available to be pumped. And I’m 5’5 1/2” and weigh 159. I was 200 pounds a few years ago and lost 41 lbs. I’ve been trying for over 1 year to get down to 140 and I can’t!!! They also put me on Metoprolol 25 mg to slow down my heart rate but after a year of taking it they told me to stop taking it because my heart rate was at 45 ; so now it’s back to shooting up. This anxiety is terrible too. I feel like a walking time bomb that I’m going to go into cardiac arrest at any moment. It’s so scary when I see my heart shoot up when I stand up or I feel it pounding.

The drs. in the hospital insisted he needed to be on cholesterol med. When I told them he NEVER in his life has had high cholesterol, they said he needed it to keep plaque from forming in his vessels. They put him on 10 mg. of Zocor. I had him cut the pills in half due to my concerns about statins. So he had been taking 5 mg. of Zocor for months. It has been a year now and, luckily, MY pcp told me you can actually have problems if your cholesterol is too low. Well. my poor husband was having severe confusion and devastating short term memory loss. He was actually crying saying, \"I can't even remember things for 5 seconds\". When he had his checkup with HIS pcp recently. I asked specifically for a lipid panel to check his cholesterol. Lo and behold before the bloodwork came back, the pcp decided he should be on MORE statins. He took him off Zocor and put him on 40 mg. of Lipitor. I called the office a couple of days later to get bloodwork results. She said she would mail me a copy and in the meantime she told me chol. was 137 (normal should not be below 131, his ldl was 78 (normal should not be below 80, hdl was 42 (normal low should not be below 40. ) I hung up in disbelief. She never once said the dr. does not want him on Lipitor. We immediately stopped all statins without consulting the dr. Within 2 days my husband was 95% back to his old self. Symptoms of low cholesterol can be confusion, agitation, memory loss, hopelessness, and depression. People have been known to commit suicide if cholesterol is too low. Please, please if your loved one does not have high cholesterol, if a dr. insists they need statins, have their levels checked after being on them a few mos.

He recommended bypass surgery.\"\n\nOn an individualized case-by-case basis, sometimes, bypass (CABG) surgery is the most viable/logical option and other times catheter-based coronary stenting is.\n\nWhile bypass surgery can be a much more thorough treatment, especially in the case of diffuse (long areas of the arterial wall is affected) disease, some experts consider stents as just a Band-aid or spot treatment, however others disagree with that description, since stents have come quite a long way now in development with drug-elution, that typically prevents/eliminates or substantially reduces the chance of having any restenosis occur, which is a build-up of scar tissue at the stented site(s).\n\nFrom the WebMD Archives (Circa 2011) BUT still relevant today!\n\nFor Multiple Heart Blockages, Bypass Surgery or Stents?\n\nStudy Compares Pain, Quality of Life After Drug-Coated Stents or Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery\n\n......a large clinical trial suggests that drug-coated stents, springy lattice tubes used to prop open clogged arteries, may also work well in patients with multiple blockages. And in some patients, the stents produce equally good results with faster recovery times......\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20110316/for-multiple-heart-blockages-bypass-surgery-or-stents#1\n\n\n\"He sent me to a surgeon, who questioned my ability to handle surgery, given he may not be able to get a good vein out of my leg.\"\n\nClinical studies (some large-scale) have shown that, depending on the type of graft used, the individual himself or herself/individualized factors, bypass grafts may/can last from 10-15 years or longer.\n\nHOWEVER, in some instances, grafts may/can fail early/prematurely (e.g., 1, 2 or 3 years) or even fail right after or shortly after the surgical procedure is completed.\n\nCommon venous grafts are the greater saphenous veins (GSVs) in the leg(s), which are accustomed to low pressure. Common arterial (accustomed to high pressure and are more resistant to atherosclerosis) grafts are internal mammary or thoracic arteries (in the chest, most common is the left as opposed to the right, sometimes both can be used) and radial arteries (in the arm). Uncommon graft conduits include the right gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery and the subscapular artery.\n\nSaphenous vein graft (SVG) failure after bypass surgery may be a high as 5%-10% in the first post-operative week. Disruption of graft endothelium correlates with early graft failure. The cardiothoracic surgeon should take measures during the surgery to avoid endothelial injury to the vein graft.\n\nSymptoms of a failed or collapsed bypass graft, include that of a blocked native coronary artery, which can include (when there is no, or insufficient collaterals, backup or rescue vessels) heart attack, myocardial infarction (MI, actual death or necrosis of heart muscle), which in turn can gradually, or quickly/suddenly (acutely) lead to heart failure/congestive heart failure, and sometimes sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n\nIf/when common procedures, first time or re-do, such as bypass or angioplasty, with or without stents, are not deemed feasible, there may/can be other options that includes non-invasive EECP, laser-based TMR or PMR/PMC, and gene therapy/transfer.\n\n\"The surgeon has a very cavilier attitude about my health. Any suggestions?\"\n\nDo feel free to seek a second professional medical opinion. ALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

Me and my family were preparing for the worst, however I had one particular reason to fight for: My first child was on the way.\n\nThe next morning, I was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. I was sent for a cardiac catheterization, and that's when I met heart failure specialist Ross Zimmer, MD. I put my life in Dr. Zimmer's hands, and in under a year I was fully recovered and back on track.

She said could be a pulled muscle (don't think so), I thought it could be Pleurisy, or it could be Carotid Artery Dissection. So treatment was to go home ... take a muscle relaxer, anti inflammatory meds, and I could take Hydrocodone. Also scheduled me for a sonogram of the Carotid. I sat up on the couch into the night. Fell asleep sitting up. But did wake up in the middle of the night and they pain was gone. I crawled into bed and slept. The sonogram was done today, but I do not have any results yet. My question ... can a carotid Artery Dissection come on quickly and go away in a day or two. I seem fine now. It just seems weird to come on so quickly and leave quickly. p.s. sorry for the long post.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Carotid artery dissection","resp_content":">>>Carotid artery dissection is a separation of the layers of the artery wall (that does not come and go) supplying oxygen-bearing blood to the head and brain and is the most common cause of stroke in young adults.\n\nThe opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

I have Googled, asked everyone I know including a few nurses and her doctors, I have even read medical books! Since she has had both heart issues and breathing issues, I figured Heart Health was the appropriate place to post this.\n\nTo start with, she will be 62 in September and has for the most part been in perfect health her entire life. Her immune system is a ROCK, she NEVER gets sick even though she works in a school where kids are sick all the time. She has always been a smoker, a pack a day or sometimes less. Always had a ton of ambition, has worked full time for as long as I can remember and used to work two jobs when I was little. She is less than two months away from retirement!\n\nIt all began around 6 months ago, she started developing a nasty cough. We figured it was caused by her smoking, so I told her it was time to quit! She cut down, first to around 5 cigarettes a day, then to 1 or 2. It did no good at all with the cough, it actually got worse and she started to lose energy mid day and was very tired and lathargic at night. This persisted for a few months, so she went to the doctors. The doctor seemed to think it was caused by acid reflux and prescribed her medication for that. It seemed to help a little, but not much. Her vitamin D was also low, so she was prescribed a supplement to take each day. None of this was really helping the problem, still coughing, still low energy later in the day but felt fine early in the day. Then one morning things got worse quick, she called me and said she wasn't feeling right and needed me to check on her (I live right next door). So I ran over as fast as I could, she couldn't stand up and walk without getting weak and falling down, she was sweating bad, dizzy, heart racing. I called 911 immediately and she was brought to the local hospital, diagnosed with AFIB. I thought this could be part of the answer, the lack of oxygen to her blood is causing her fatigue, which has been the most crippling part of all of this! She was given Xarelto and a few other meds, I know she was given a blood thinner, maybe that is what the Xarelto is? Anyways, after staying there for 48 hours, she was sent home! When she first got home she was feeling a little better, she went back to work after a few days and I figured half the battle was won! This sadly has not been the case, as the cough had gotten worse, as had her breathing. A lot of the time she was wheezing, especially during a coughing spell. The cough is productive, as it does produce phglehm but it never seems to get better and in fact, worsens. She hadn't been able to sleep a full night in over 2 months at that time, it has effected her sleeping down to maybe 4-5 hours a night, sometimes less!\n\nThen about 2 1/2 weeks ago, she had a doctors appointment. At this point she had been working most days, she has as many sick days as she needs to take off before retirment but being they were intended to pay for her health insurance, she don't want to use all of them. When she got to the doctors, they found an alarming abnormality in her EKG and wanted her to go to a hospital immediatly! This time they sent her to a hospital around 50 miles away, that specializes in heart health. The hospital is well known for it's cardiac unit and I figured she was in good hands and maybe we could finally get some answers! They did an EKG there, said it was fine, blamed it on the doctors offices EKG machine and said her heart was fine. We asked what was causing the fatigue and cough to get worse and he acted like he couldn't even look at it! Basically said since he checked her heart and it was fine, he wasn't doing anything else. Not check her breathing, not refer her to anyone, nothing! There were over a DOZEN overdoses in the emergency department during the time we were there and they seemed to take precidence over her, which is absolutely obsurd! At any rate, we left there with no more information than we had, her coughing getting more persistant to the point it makes her chest hurt from coughing so much and her fatigue getting worse! Was NOT impressed by that hospital and as I have chosen not to put them on blast, if you live in central NY, ask and I shall tell!\n\nAs the past two weeks have went on, she has gotten even worse. Now just walking from her chair to the bedroom and back or through the store has her out of breath. She feels normal when she is sitting or lying down, besides the cough. She just has NO energy to do anything, even talk much sometimes. Gets winded and starts wheezing walking a short distance, especially in the heat. To recap, before 5 days ago we knew almost nothing of what is causing this. A week ago she went in and had a chest X-ray done, nothing abnormal came up on that. She had a breathing test done and her breathing is at 50% capacity. Her doctor ordered for her to have a CAT scan done 5 days ago, she went and had it done at our local hospital then came home. She couldn't have been home an hour and they called her up, wanted her to come back in right then to talk about the results! I was freaking out! All I could think was lung cancer as my brother died at 35 from germ cell carcinoma of the lungs. Turned out they found \"abnormal tissue\" at the base of her esophagaus. Her lymph nodes at the site were also swollen, which for whatever reason alarmed the doctors. This is what they are saying is causing the cough and the lack of oxygen, making her fatigued. They told her that her lungs were in great shape, which came as a surprise being she has smoked her entire life up until recently. There were no tumors or anything at the site of the abnormal tissue, her blood work also came back great. When my brother was battling cancer, there were markers in his blood which indicated cancer, none were found in my moms blood work. She has to have a scope and a culture done on her esophagaus this coming Monday, then see an oncologist. Issue is it KEEPS getting worse and is starting to worry me greatly! Sleeping a few hours a night, falling asleep during the day, she is starting to get depressed and down in her spirits which is not like her at all. I am now doing all of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, etc... as she cannot walk far at all without being out of breathe. Absolutely do not mind at all helping her, she is just an independent person who is looking forward to enjoying her retirement!\n\nAside from the scope Monday, no other appointments are scheduled including the oncologist appointment. All the doctors including her own, are on \"vacation\". I just see this as much more serious than they do, after losing my father to a stroke and my only sibling to cancer, I don't want to lose my mom. The worse she gets, the more I worry and make her call and try to find out ANY information on some action being taken. The ONLY thing that does help a little is a nebulizer, which she just got today. It helps her breathe better and I have noticed the cough is not so bad. Tonight she is sleeping much better, which is really good! She has two inhalers, one does not do anything, that is the twice daily one. The other is one she can take whenever she wants or a \"rescue inhaler\", that one makes her heart race and feel funny so she is not using that one. At this point, we are both very worried about what could be wrong and I am sick of watching my mother suffer while doctors take vacations! At very least, someone could look into the issue far enough to provide some relief from the symptoms! Problem is, no one even knows exactly what the problem is yet!\n\nIf anyone has any insight at all it would be GREATLY appreciated! As for immediate family, my mother and my son are ALL I have! They are almost all I have in general although I feel I should mention, my moms parents are still alive. My grandmother is 87 and my grandfather is 92! My great grandparents also died in their 90's, so living to be very old runs in my moms family. Good health runs in her family, there are no genetic diseases or cancer in her family history at all, other than diabetes. This is why I do not get why her health is slipping so quickly.... She was fine 7 months ago, now she can't even do most things for herself? Seeing this is killing me and the doctors aren't a ton of help or in a big hurry around here, which I personally feel they should be!

At beginning I felt this pain several times per day in waves that sometimes lasted only about 10 minutes but sometimes even 2 hours. The intensity of pain also varied, at some points I could barely notice it and other times it was pretty uncomfortable, but it never got too severe and unbearable.\n\nAfter about 3 weeks of this pain I went to my doctor, he did some basic examination, but did not found anything. He just said that I should take some vitamin B supplements and use some topical pain killer cream to manage pain. I also did some basic blood and urine tests which didn’t show anything unusual and I also got echocardiography done and doctor said that that everything looks fine.\n\nIn following couple of months intensity and frequency of pain decreased. I still felt it almost every day, but it just wasn’t bothering me as much as before so I thought it was getting better, but last week the pain started getting worse again and for past few days I feel it basically all the time. The intensity still varies, but in average it is definitely stronger than before. Now I also have noticeable pain in my left arm and shoulder and at some points I also feel light pain or stiffness in my back, neck and jaw.\n\nResearching my symptoms online suggests some kind of heart problem, but in those cases pain seems to be more periodical, but I have it all the time and I also haven’t really noticed shortness of breath and the pain doesn't get worse when I am moving around.\n\nI have scheduled another appointment with my doctor in a few days, but I still would like to know other people opinions on what might be wrong.

Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\n\n\n=\nThe opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

I'm looking for some support on my recent heart health issues. I'm a 43 y/o male nonsmoker. I have significant family history of poor heart health on my mothers side. I won't go into all of the specifics unless to keep this as short as possible. Here's my story:\n\nAround the first of this year I noticed some occasional dull achy chest pain. Was very sporadic and could happen at any time. This eventually became more and more frequent. In March I was sitting at work and was feeling the dull ache when I had an episode of sudden intense chest pain that doubled me over and caused SOB, nausea, and extreme sweating. A couple of weeks later I had some extreme SOB after moving a heavy object. My PCP did a work up (chest xray, holter monitor, ekg). All was normal except for ekg shows bradycardia (I exercise frequently). Cardiologist was not impressed but offered to order a stress test or CTA of Heart for my peace of mind. Being and xray tech, I opted for the CTA and it was positive for LAD stricture. On May 30th a Heart cath revealed an 80% \"widow maker\" stenosis in the mid LAD. Stent was placed and after increasing my workout routine I felt like a new man after a couple of weeks, all symptoms gone. Afterwards I correlated extreme fatigue and dizziness.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and the dull achy pain starts coming back along with fatigue. On 9/27 I was jogging and had some pretty intense chest pain along with nausea and sweating. A trip to the ER and a heart cath later in the day and they find another 75% stenosis even more proximal in the LAD. Another stent was placed. F/u with my cardiologist was interesting. He doesn't feel that either stenting explained any of my symptoms and he couldn't explain why the other blockage happened so quickly. I'm still having the dull achy pressure/pain along with dizziness and sporadic SOB. On 10/16 I was also having some sharp stabbing type pain as well so I went to ER AGAIN. Nothing was found, troponin was ok. Was kept overnight for observation. Eventually the pains stopped in the night.\n\nMy PCP is not satisfied that what has been done is sufficient. Based on the location of these blockages, he's concerned that maybe a bypass was the correct option from the start. Both interventionalists mentioned the possibility of by pass before each stent. My cardiologist says I need to be seen in a tertiary facility and I have an apt to see a specialist on 11/9.\n\nIt's hard to correlate all of the things that I'm experiencing, but I know that something is not right with me. Any information or ideas would be very welcome.

I would like to know your outcome if you don’t mind sharing later.","resp_content":"\nSince this post a few months ago I have been through another heart cath (3 in one year) on 11-2-18 at Barnes Jewish in St. Louis. I was told it was normal and that my heart was not the reason for the continued chest pain, dizziness, and shortness of breath. It was recommended that I have an EGD done to check my esophagus, this was normal and the pain continues. I had a follow up at Barnes on 1-18-19 and the cardiologist there continued to tell me that my heart was fine and that’s he didn’t know why I was still having pain. He offered to refer me to a colleague who runs the facilities clinic for people who have chronic chest pain. I saw him on 1-22-19 and after reviewing my chart, history and doing a physical exam he confidently diagnosed me with 2 types of coronary microvascular disorders-Coronary Slow Flow and Prinzmetal Angina. I had researched these types of things extensively and in my mind I thought this was the problem. A confirming diagnosis was extremely relieving, even though it means my heart has problems-but I already knew that in my gut. So now it’s a matter of getting the right combination of meds for me that will help control the spasms and open up the arteries. It’s a bit too soon to know for sure, but I think they are helping already.\n\nI highly recommend that if anyone who reads this and has continued, hard to explain chest pain, keep searching for a doctor who will listen to you and take you seriously. Microvascular disease is not a “made up” diagnosis. There has been a lot of literature coming out of late about the seriousness of the problems this can cause. Best of luck to anyone who reads this.\nReply\nsligamer\nover 1 year ago\nSo glad I found this article. xrayguy we are the same age with the same problem. I had a 99 blockage stented in my widow maker. Two other stents after that. One of my cardiologist suggest my symptoms \"extreme fatigue, chest pains, random feel dizzy\" were spasms caused by the stents not allow for natural contraction of the arteries. Are you able to say what the medication they prescribed?\nReply\nxrayguy\nover 1 year ago\nSligamer, sounds very familiar. Hope you get the right help. I’ve been on many different meds in the past 9 months in several different combinations. What I’m on now that is working is Diltiazem 24 Hr Er (Cardizem) 240mg twice a day along with Isosorbide Mononitrate Er (Imdur) 60mg once a day. I also take sublingual Nitro when then pain is really bad, but I’ve only done that once since put on this new regimen. I also take aspirin, Plavix, and Crestor. The Imdur does give severe headaches that do gradually go away with time. I was taking a couple of Tylenol in advance to help with that before the headaches let up. The Cardiologist that finally diagnosed me said it’s all about getting the right drugs and dosages for each patient, but he said that Cardizem works best for most. Hope this helps and best of luck to you. I know exactly how you feel and it really degrades your life.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/70820/proximal-and-mid-lad-stents"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Surprising Causes of Chest Pain","post_content":"Chest pain doesn’t always mean you’re having a heart attack.

It started on New Year’s Eve. It’s been pretty off and on but has been bugging me a lot today. I am fairly inactive and sedentary. I don’t do much exercising and I have a desk job. I’m overweight with my height being 5’7 and my weight at 230.\n\nI went to the emergency room about a week ago for this pain. I was given an ECG, a chest x day and blood tests. My heart rate is always high and was around 100 when they took it. Everything came back normal so they sent me home. I then went to my regular doctor for bloodwork on my cholesterol to see if anything noticeable or off showed up but my cholesterol was 180 and all my levels were pretty normal. Nothing crazy.\n\nAnyway, my question is what should I do next? Why am I having this pain? I do get out of breath fast from physical exertion and eating big meals gives me the sweats. I’m afraid to even attempt to exercise for fear of injuring myself or dropping dead from blowing whatever ailment this is out of wack triggering it.\n\nIf I go to a cardiologist what will they do? I am so terrified of winding up admitted and getting stents and surgeries.

I pretty much demanded another angiogram.\"\n\nInvasive X-ray angiography (angiogram, heart catheterization) is still considered as being the \"gold standard\" in imaging the coronary arteries, its branches, and in determining the degree/percentage of the blockage(s).\n\n\"Three years ago I received two stents. It did nothing for my shortness of breath, pain in throat & jaws and burning chest.\"\n\nTechnically, stenting in the coronary arteries should provide immediate relief of any symptoms that were [directtly] caused by one or more blood flow-limiting blockages (stenosis, narrowing).\n\n\"It showed my right artery to be 100% blocked. The second procedure was done by a different cardiologist. He didn't do anything and.....\"\n\n\nAs applicable, if/when a coronary artery is 100% blocked (total occlusion), there sometimes is a process that involves the formation of so-called coronary artery collaterals, a natural development, which is a gradual process, creating one's own \"bio-bypass\" so to speak, involving tiny (rescue or backup) vessels, that connect two larger coronary arteries or different segments of the same artery. These vessels provide an alternate route for blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium) when called for in an emergency.\n\nThose who have well-developed (and open) coronary artery collaterals are the lucky ones, because this form of blood supply, helps protect the heart from an attack (myocardial infarction), or limits the damage to the heart muscle from tissue death if/when the normal blood supply is totally cut off.\n\nThe main drawback is that these collaterals, if/when actually present, are not really meant to carry the whole load of the heart, though they may/can provide significant blood flow in some individuals.\n\nThese vessels seldom delivers the same amount of blood flow that the unblocked native artery or arteries originally did, but the blood flow may be/can be enough to ease/reduce chest pain/discomfort in some individuals and reduce the risk of a serious heart attack some time later on.\n\nAlways be proactive in your health care and treatment. Sometimes this requires being assertive.\n\nI hope the coming new year is better and brighter for you. :)\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n"},{"author":"healtheheart","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Blocked artery","resp_content":"\" Over the past 3 years I've had 4 stress tests and 1 with imaging.

Here in canada it is rare to have any intervention on an occlusion below 70% and even then, it depends on blood flow and location. So, it is possible that you had another artery that worsened during that time.\n\nStress tests, even with imaging can sometimes miss certain blockages. As cardiostar mentioned, an angogram is the gold standard.\n\n\"The second procedure was done by a different cardiologist.

My guess is that no one felt as though they understood your symptoms or had useful advice to give.\n\nFor that matter, I'm not going to have much either. I'm a babe in the woods in these matters. But I've just discovered that I have stage 2 hypertension. I suppose the doc will put me on some sort of medication. He's the one who brought this to my attention and this is why I've come to WebMD to research.\n\nBut.....anyway........I've also had atrial fibrillation for all of my life. (Now in my late 50s) And there are similarities to what you've described. My attacks are quite different from yours in that I've never woken up out of sleep having an attack, for instance. Mine come usually out of the blue in the middle of the day. Though being startled can also cause an attack.\n\nIt's impossible for me to tell, of course, if what you have is A fib. But I certainly do know the frightening feeling of having your heart running amok. Pounding hard and in some weird rhythm.\n\nI went to the ER once with it about 20 years ago. I went because that time it just felt as though something was really, really wrong. I had the same result as you; they couldn't find anything wrong.\n\nUsually it doesn't frighten me into worrying that I'm headed for the grave. It just makes me feel awful. I've got nothing left in me and I usually don't recover until I've had a full night's sleep. There was a period in my life a few decades back, though, where I found myself saying, in my imagination, to my heart, \"Look! If you're going to kill me, then why don't you just get it over with?\" But I haven't felt that way in some time.\n\nSince this sort of ailment gives one a much higher chance of stroke than average, I've been taking a low dose aspirin daily for many years now in order to keep my blood as thin as possible.\n\nNow........let's both remember something.........I am absolutely, positively not qualified to give you medical advice. And you have a responsibility to yourself and your family to take anything I say with a heavy grain of salt.\n\nThat said, you might consider the aspirin. It's likely that no doctor will object. But you should still consult yours because of the possibility that it might interact badly with your prescriptions. And there might be other reasons.\n\nBeyond that, your troubles could still be anxiety. Maybe you're suffering from 'night terrors'. I've no experience, that I know of, with such things. But I do get the impression that it's something different from simple nightmares. If something is frightening you deep within your soul, then it certainly could result in an elevated heart rate, blood pressure and arhythmia (spelling?). Such a result would be independent of whether or not you were consciously aware of the cause. Perhaps some aspect of your waking life which is causing you worry (happens to all of us) is subtly attacking you in your sleep?\n\nAnother piece of unqualified medical advice, which you should only follow if this makes very good sense to you, is that you ought to give up on the ER for these episodes. They can't help you.\n\nYou certainly have my sympathy. And I'm sorry that I don't know enough to make any more concrete suggestions.\n\nBut you have no choice but to view your doctors with a cooperative attitude. Try those prescriptions they wish. If one fails, then ask for another and you might stumble upon an effective treatment. It might happen even without your awareness of it. But that's fine, too.\n\nBest of luck.\n"},{"author":"puggielover","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Heart Racing/bp spikes","resp_content":"Hi I read your concerns,I went through a late menopause and my blood pressure started getting higher dr kept checking me.

She has a regular cardiologist who came and looked at all her test results and said there's nothing wrong with her heart. She was just at his office two weeks ago and he had said then that there was nothing wrong with her heart. They kept her for 3 days because of this level. Supposedly they wanted it to go down before discharging her. I just looked at her hospital patient portal for the results of these Pro BNP tests and the test was done 4 times (once was from a visit back in March) and each time the result was even higher than the last. If they kept her the first time because her level was over 4,000 - why would they discharge her with a level at over 7,000? And, why would her cardiologist be insisting there's nothing wrong with her heart? I get that her ekg's, echo's and x-rays must have been normal, but then why is this level so higher and getting higher?

The procedure was courtesy of the UK NHS, not private, so I am afraid I wasn't given a lot of information about the exact nature of the test I was subjected to. All I can do is describe what happened to me. I had to attend on two occasions. During the first visit I was injected with something - I think it was radioactive. Then I was attached to an ECG machine while a drug was injected into me which made my heart speed up. I was not scanned during this procedure. I think I was then asked to consume three cups of water before the next test - or I might be mistaken and that was required before the last test. Then I was taken to a room where I had to lie down while a machine slowly moved position around my chest taking images. After this I was rolled into a tube like machine - part of which rotated very fast - and more images were taken. The following week I was given the radioactive injection and asked to drink water and had the two types of image test again but this time I did not have the heart stress drug nor was I attached to the ECG machine.

A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly. The top number goes form 110-180 extremely quickly without any reason and the bottom number usually stays around 80, but yesterday it went to 120 multiple times. I am now always slightly dizzy and lightheaded and I cannot even do something like take the dog for a walk without losing all my color and falling. I have passed out twice after attempting to push myself. I have also gone to the ER twice, urgent care once and attempted to figure out the problem with my new primary care doctor. The ER did an EKG and bloodwork which were fine, though I I was experiencing syncopy, with my pulse at 46-49. My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally.

Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nTaking BP measurements when at rest/relaxed will help yield more consistent readings. If one has had a peaceful night's sleep, then measurements are best taken as soon as one awakes in the morning, as at this time of the day, the body will be at its lowest functioning levels, both physically and mentally, and therefore the factors that affect BP will be minimized. One should try to take the BP at the same time(s) every day.\n\nPLUS, there was a study, in which University of Virginia researchers tested 100 individuals two times, once while they perched on a doctor's table, feet dangling, and then again as they sat in a chair with both feet resting on the floor and their back and arms supported.\n\nSystolic BP, the top number, dropped by 13 points on average while sitting in the chair. Why's this? According to study author Melly Turner, RN, if your arm, back, and legs are not supported, then you're exerting energy while being tested.\n\nThe prestigious American Heart Association has been recommending the chair method, but harried medical staff often don't employ it. Sit quietly in a proper chair for 5 minutes before having the BP checked, and be sure the arm being used rests on a flat surface.\n\nTake care.\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\nGet the most out of home blood pressure monitoring\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-blood-pressure/HI00016\n"},{"author":"MikeH69701","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Why do I feel like a guinea pig ?","resp_content":"I found my blood pressure to be fairly well controlled with Losartan and Amlodipine.

Last Tuesday I had a check up with my family doctor. I felt fine, nurse checked my bp 3 times and it was 170/112. I was on 20 mg Benzaepril and my doctor added 50 mg Toporol once a day. Fast forward to Thursday, I was getting stuff done before work and just didn't feel right, took it with our home monitor and it was 193/117. H called the ambulance and to the hospital I went. EKG, stress test, blood work and echo were all ok, they kept me 48 hours to observe. In that time my pressure never dipped below 150/100. Been monitoring it since I got home and it's still been high, my Dr said Toporol could take 3 weeks to make a difference and I'm worried something is going to happen before then. Since I came home I've cut out all caffeine, processed foods, sugar, etc. I want to exercise but they told me not to because that will send it higher and not to exercise unmonitored. I have an appt next week with my family Dr and September with the cardiologist. I know to go back if the chest pains start again but at this point what else can I do?

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\n====>High BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nAdditionally, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A consistently narrow (say 20-25 or less) or consistently wide (say 60-65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

Over the past few months some really strange things have happen to me. First, I am 60 years old but for the most part VERY healthy, and I out run most of the teenagers at work. I have had high blood pressure all of my life but was told it was normal for my body?? I am not over weight and very muscular for my age.\n\nAnyway I have been having episodes of vertigo for no apparent reason. It has happen a few times at work, once while driving which scared the hell out of me. Just for a few seconds I will feel like I am going to pass out and there is ALWAYS a strange smell or taste associated with it. Can't explain the smell or taste, kind of a bitter sweet?\n\nThe episodes pass very quickly. Lasting only a minute or so but leave me feeling very unsure of my self. I can be doing something, or just standing still like today when they happen. A few weeks ago I had another strange thing happen but I kind of wrote this one off as mild heat stroke or dehydration. Was working outside all day (Texas heat) Decided to go in the house so I told my son lets go in. Saw there was one more thing I needed to get done before I went in so I told my son I was going to do that first...... All of a sudden I looked up and said ok, where the hell am I. I said lets go in. A few minutes later I told my son I was going back out to do the thing I had mentioned and he said Dad, you already did that???? I said no I didn't. He said yes you did. I went out there and YES I had, and I had lost about 45 minutes worth of time doing it. I still do not remember any of it. This board says there are 37 conditions that relate to vertigo with strange taste or smell but when I read them I can't find any that mention taste or smell.\n\nJust lately, I have had either a slight cold or \"sinus infection\" which was making me cough a lot when the sinuses would drain. I thought I had kicked it a few days ago but one of the conditions the board mentions is sinus related???\n\nOh, and I am a Doctors worst nightmare. Haven't been to see a doctor in about 10 years and that was only because of a bad accident. I do have high blood pressure, I eat one meal a day and have my entire life, I do smoke and have for the past 45 years, but at least I do not drink. Gotta do something right, right?\n\nThoughts????

It’s usually on the left side but sometimes it’s on the right side too. The pain will occasionally reside but it’s there most of the time.

The left main was 0. Circumflex 14.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar, coronary artery calcification scoring (via CT heart scan) can be calculated using a standard Agatston/Janowitz (AJ) method. When correlated with a patient’s personal information, the score can yield an estimation of a patients risk for coronary artery disease.\n\nThe problem with arterial calcification is that it is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation, though soft plaque (easier to perform angioplasty and stenting on, typically for blockages of 70/75% or greater) is more dangerous and unpredictable than hard or calcified plaque.\n\nNoteworthy, back in April 2007, in animal studies, it showed that high levels of vitamin K resulted in a 37% reduction in calcium buildup in the arteries. This first-in-animals study also showed that decreased arterial elasticity can be reversed as well.\n\nOf course, what works well in animals does not mean that it will translate into a clinical benefit in humans.\n\nVitamin K is found in many kinds of foods, and is also available in dietary supplement form, though in some cases, this can do more harm than good (due to side effects, or interactions with drugs, e.g., Coumadin).\n\nThough coronary artery disease (CAD) is a lifelong unpredictable condition (requiring a continuum of care), it has been reported, that in some individuals, it's possible to halt or even reverse/regress atherosclerotic plaque to some degree, through lifestyle changes, customized prescription drug-therapy, strict or specialized diet (e.g., Ornish), exercise regimen, and stress management.\n\nWebMD Health News - archives\n\nCalcium in Arteries May Predict Heart Risk\n\nStudy Shows a Calcium Score May Be Helpful Tool in Predicting Heart Disease - April 27, 2010\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20100427/calcium-in-arteries-may-predict-heart-risk\n\nCalcium in Arteries Signals Heart Death\n\nCalcium Buildup Could Lead to Sudden Cardiac Death Within 5 Years - 8/27/03\n\nCalcium in the coronary arteries has always been bad news, signaling the onset of heart disease.\n\nOften No Warning Signs\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20030827/calcium-arteries-death\n\n\"I have been on statins......\"\n\nAbout risk factors / Statins\n\nAs reported, it is known that a risk factor merely increases the probability that one will develop cardiovascular disease, BUT doesn't 100% guarantee that one will develop it, nor does its absence (or even the absence of ALL known risk factors) 100% guarantee that one won't have a heart attack or brain attack.\n\nL@@K Back in the Media\n\n**Intensive Cholesterol Lowering With Atorvastatin Halts Progression Of Heart Disease, Cleveland Clinic-Led Study Shows\n\n'REVERSAL' Trial\n\nThe REVERSAL trial, compared the highest doses available at the time of two popular statin drugs, pravastatin and atorvastatin....\n\n\"When we analyzed the results of REVERSAL, we realized that we had found an approach to coronary disease treatment that could LITERALLY STOP heart disease in its tracks\"......\n\n- - -\n\nAdditionally, as reported, the symptoms of artery-narrowing atherosclerosis are highly variable. Those with mild atherosclerosis may present with clinically important symptoms and signs of disease and heart attack, or absolute worst case scenario, sudden cardiac death may be the first and only symptom of coronary artery disease. However, many individuals with anatomically advanced disease may have no symptoms and experience no functional impairment.\n\nMost important, vulnerable plaque (which was reported on the program 20/20 on abc TV some years back, the cause of the majority of heart attacks via bursting or rupturing), hides well-away within the vessel wall (causing no symptoms), and thus can't be seen with invasive X-ray angiography/angiogram/heart catheterization.\n\nOn the positive side, statins may/can stabilize vulnerable plaque (VP), though on the negative side, some individuals may/can experience side effects/adverse reactions, such as memory loss, muscle aches/pains. On an individualized case-by-case basis, the benefits of taking a statin, at any dose, must clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nAdditionally, statins also have anti-inflammatory properties and as applicable to the patient, thus lowers C-reactive protein (CRP/hs-CRP). Inflammation is recognized as a major player in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMd/WebMD forums DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/56107/1200-coronary-calcium-diabetes-mother-died-of-atherosclerosis"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Not tolerate to heat","post_content":"I started having the same problem last summer.

Tachycardia can be appropriate (expected, anticipated) or inapporpriate (not expected or anticipated).\n\nAs applicable (must be 100% diagnosed, confirmed) to the patient, there is a specific condition known as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).\n\nPOTS is defined as a clinically significant increase in heart rate (anywhere from occurring immediately or to within 10-30 minutes) upon standing from a lying down or sitting position.\n\nThe length/duration of time patients diagnosed with POTS can comfortably stand varies wdely from one individual to another.\n\nPOTS often generates a temporary rise in blood pressure (BP) immediately upon standing due to rapid acceleration of the heart rate.\n\nPOTS patients often have a measurably low standing pulse pressure (that is, difference between systolic and diastolic, normal resting pulse pressure is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit), which may/can be an indicator of blood pooling (collecting).\n\nSome patients with POTS have a damaged regulatory system that may/can result in paradoxical wild swings in BP from under 50 mmHg to over 200 mmHg. Complexly, POTS can be a low and high BP pressure problem combined.\n\nDuring a Tilt Table Test, some POTS patients have large drops in BP and pass out (syncope, temporary loss of consciousness, also includes fainting), while other patients have only relatively shallow/small drops in BP, or none at all.\n\n75% of POTS patients are female with a genetic tendency to be passed down from mother to daughter.\n\n\"I’ve also been feeling a tingling feeling on my left hand (needles poking my left arm)\"\n\nTingling or numbness, the feeling or sensation thereof, is medically known as paresthesias and has various causes, some harmless, some serious to life-threatening.\n\nA tingling feeling or sensation may/can occur anywhere on the body and should always be thoroughly investigated by a qualified doctor, especially if this is occurring frequently or over a long period of time (chronic) now.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/55359/sudden-fast-heartbeats"},{"post":{"author":"badheart","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Extensive Cardiac History","post_content":"I have had a cabbage X2, Cartoid endartecomy right side, 7 stents, 4 in artery on the back of my heart.

It's hard for me to translate the pain into words, but I'll try. It happens behind my sternum. It feels... sore and heavy? It's also kind of difficult to breathe when it happens. It lasts for several minutes.\n\nI also get rib pains (not always at the same time). It kind of feels like someone is tying a corset onto me or that my ribcage is shrinking.\n\nI have a possible cause: I have lost weight in this past year. In August 2017, I was 123 pounds and started to diet. I lost 5 pounds by January. Another 5 by the end of January, and 10 since March. I'm not sure if that's considered \"rapid\" weight loss, but I know rapid weight loss can cause chest pain.\n\nOther possibilities include stress or anxiety. My job has been rather stressful since March and on, and I do suffer from anxiety.\n\nSo I have two questions:\n1. Is there a way to definitively determine the cause of the pain if I go to the doctor? Are there physical tests to find the cause? Or will it be a guessing game?\n\n2.

I weight about 285lbs and am only 5'4\". I do have known issues with acid reflux and I had a stomach ulcer within the last year and esophagitis? I am trying to eat better and less, but still I struggle. Recently, since around January, I have been having strange chest pains. My left side of my chest hurts almost every day, some days it doesn't though, but those days are rare. My left arm has an uncomfortable pain aswell... It's not really painful, like a sharp or stabbing pain would be, but it's really uncomfortable and feels like something is wrong if that makes sense. I will randomly become very weak, shaky and feel like I will pass out. I've been getting the most intense head pains, on the sides where my temples are and have never had headaches like it before in my life. Also at random times, even when not doing anything, my chest will feel like it's pumping hard and fast as if I just ran or something. I want to exercise but I am actually scared to at this point. And the worst part of it all is that I cannot sleep at all! For months now, whenever I lay down I can barely breathe. I am usually a side sleeper but that is not even an option now, and can barely sleep on my back either. I try to sleep sitting up but I am just so miserable and uncomfortable. I want to go to my doctor to maybe get my heart checked out, but she always just kind of brushes me off and says \"You're morbidly obese, you need to lose weight and exercise and you will feel better.\" Is that true or should I be pushing for more to be looked at? I mean I'm sure it would help and I know that it needs to be done but I feel like I'm about to drop dead.\n\nA few other things to mention:\n-My breasts are very very large and heavy, so heavy and large that they cover my whole stomach. Maybe they are too heavy for my chest and my arm is constantly off to the side because they can't rest against my sides due to my gigantic breasts.\n\n-I recently had a blood test done, in I think December, to see if I had a problem with my thyroid. It came back that I do not have a problem with it, but surely she would see if I had other problems right, so I should be okay?\n\n-My dad died from an undetected enlarged heart, which led to a brain aneurysm. He went to the doctor almost twice a month and the coroner told us his heart was 3x the size of a normal heart.\n\nI guess my question is just, should I look for another doctor since I feel that mine doesn't listen to me or do anything when I tell her how badly I feel or is it just because I am so fat and I have to deal with it until I lose a massive amount of weight?","like_count":"0","tags":["Exercise","Diet","Heart Failure","Heart Attack","Heart Disease"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Is something wrong or am I just fat?","resp_content":"The opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

Average resting heart rate in men is 72-78 BPM and in women 78-84 BPM. Over 100 BPM is tachycardia (fast heartbeat).\n\nAs applicable (must be confirmed, diagnosed by a qualified doctor) to the patient, there is a specific condition known as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).\n\nAs reported, POTS is defined as a clinically significant increase in heart rate (anywhere from occurring immediately or to within 10-30 minutes) upon standing from a lying down or sitting position.\n\nThe length/duration of time patients diagnosed with POTS can comfortably stand varies wdely from one individual to another.\n\nPOTS often generates a temporary rise in blood pressure (BP) immediately upon standing due to rapid acceleration of the heart rate.\n\nPOTS patients often have a measurably low standing pulse pressure (that is, difference between systolic and diastolic, normal resting pulse pressure is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit), which may/can be an indicator of blood pooling (collecting).\n\nSome patients with POTS have a damaged regulatory system that may/can result in paradoxical wild swings in BP from under 50 mmHg to over 200 mmHg. Complexly, POTS can be a low and high BP pressure problem combined.\n\nDuring a Tilt Table Test, some POTS patients have large drops in BP and pass out (syncope, temporary loss of consciousness, also includes fainting), while other patients have only relatively shallow/small drops in BP, or none at all.\n\n75% of POTS patients are female with a genetic tendency to be passed down from mother to daughter.\n\n.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"As star was saying it maybe POTS.

They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me.\n\nIn December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months. \n\nI have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened.

First off nobody can read the lab results you posted so all I have to go on is what you communicated. When they ran the d-dimer and the other labs did they tell you if they were in a normal range? If so and if the chest ct was negative then it is highly unlikely your mother has a PE or DVT. Coughing up a chunk of blood 2 weeks ago doesn't mean she has a PE. If could have come from her sinuses or her GI tract. I have had both PEs and DVTs. With a PE you have a chronic cough with pink froth and severe pain in the chest and the pain does not come and go it stays until the PE is gone. Same with a DVT. Is her leg discolored? Purplish to white with no pink nailbeds in the toes. Does your mother remember injuring her leg in anyway? Has she had to sit in 1 position for several hours like on a plane? DVT's are rarely spontaneous there has to be a reason for one to develop in a persons leg. Lack of movement in the legs or some injury are the most likely cause of DVTs. Chest CT would have shown a mass in the lung if she had lung cancer. Yes you should make a list of your and your mom's concerns to address with her primary care physician. Be ready to listen to what you are told and make notes. If you are not satisfied get a second opinion. As far as dizziness when she goes to lay down or when she lays a certain way it sounds like labyrinthitis. If she has had a sinus infection this could explain the coughed up blood and the loss of balance and the dizziness. Sinus congestion can cause congestion in both the middle and inner ears. Bloody nasal drainage goes down the back of the throat and she coughs up a chunk of blood and she gets dizzy and losses her balance because of congestion and drainage in the inner ear. Could explain the difficulty in swallowing raw throat from nasal and ear drainage there are tubes that run from the ears to the throat and they can get clogged. Also dry cough once again sounds like sinus drainage.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/49471/54-y-o-female-dangerous-symptoms-blood-test-results-included-plz-help-my-mom"},{"post":{"author":"wellhellomrc","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Blood pressure","post_content":"Anyone know if ibuprofen or acetiminophen increases blood pressure.

The coroner found asolutely nothing in the autopsy. He told my counselor that after conferring with other coroners that he felt his death was due to heart arrhythmia. His death certificate says “undetermined” because the coroner cannot prove that was the cause because an episode of arrhythmia doesn't leave any signs or cause damage that can be seen. He also told her that he felt that even if I would have been there, it would not have helped because he appeared to have died immediately. I found him so I know what the scene looked like; he had been lying there for approx. 8 hours. Actually at this point I don't want to think otherwise. I know that its probably true but my heart breaks that I wasn't there & possibly could have done something.\n\nMy son literally dropped dead. He was still holding his toothbrush so I feel certain he didn’t even try to break his fall.\n\nMy question(s) is whether it is possible that at times his heartbeat was off but he just accepted it and did not find it alarming? He played soccer from 1st grade to 12th grade. I would have thought it would have presented itself during those active times.\n\nHe was healthy and so he didn't visit the doctor on any kind of regular basis. He did have major ear infections and tubes were placed in his ears on 3 separate occasions before the age of 7. He had one other surgery at the age of 18 to have his adenoids removed , so he was in surgery four times in his life. Is it really possible that there were no signs of trouble but then have one episode that killed him?\n\nAt the time of his death he was under a lot of stress about his higher education. He had just grafuated with a bachelors degree & was under a time constraint. Although he always had a very high-strung temperament he did fine in life but at home he could be trying, lol! He was always moving, it seemed, and had some anxiety but managed to control it. He presented some depression signs when away at college which I recognized because of my own depression.\n\nI know there is no absolute final answer. It has been 8 years but as a Mother it never leaves me. I do not feel guilt so I'm not looking for absolution. I think I just want to know how someone can appear to be so healthy (he did smoke & drink but moderately) & then drop dead 4 hours later? How can that happen? Did I miss some signs? Did he?\n\nI know I rambled on & I scattered some questions throughout. I understand that knowing more information does not change anything. I really want to know if there were signs that were easily overlooked.

ALSO, it is CRUCIAL that you ask your doctor about an implanted defribillator. A defib willl restart your heart if it ever stops again or goes into an arrthymia.

I'm a female & 46 years old. On February 2 I went to the ER because I was losing vision in my right eye. I was terrified. They discovered that my blood pressure was 270/150. They treated me, got the bp down a little and sent me home (crazy!). I visited an eye doctor that day and he said that I had suffered an eye stroke in my right eye due to uncontrolled high blood pressure. Back story, I'd been diagnosed with high bp about eight years ago but quit taking my meds because I didn't like my doctor. I felt fine so I figured it was fine. Dumb! So anyhow, we're assuming my bp has been incredibly high all these years. So, fast forwarded back to February. The next morning my bp was rising again and I was concerned so we went back to the ER. They admitted me that time, thankfully, and I was there for about four days. My bp seemed to be getting under control with the medication they put me on and it was 158/99 when they released me. Still high but much better.\n\nI was placed on 2 bp meds - Carvedilol 25 MG twice a day & Amlodipine 10 MG once a day - and told to follow up with a hypertension specialist and my family doctor. I also purchased a bp monitor and began taking my bp various times throughout the day. After a few weeks it was obvious the medication was working for sure because I was averaging about 125/82, sometimes much lower too.\n\nUnfortunately, I was feeling rotten. I was sleeping 12 to 13 hours at night and still needed two or three naps throughout the day. When I was awake I felt like a complete zombie. Miserable.\n\nI had an appointment with the specialist on February 27. He said that the reason I was feeling so awful was because my body was trying to adjust to my bp being so much lower after being so incredibly high for so many years. He decided to raise my bp up to about 140/90 in hopes that I'd feel better. In order to do that he cut my Carvedilol down to 12.5 MG twice a day but left the Amlodipine the same. He said if that didn't work we'd cut the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day too.\n\nWell, it worked.....kind of. My bp is still only averaging about 130/85, sometimes alittle higher or lower. But hardly ever even close to 140/90. I'm able to stay awake more but I still feel rotten. I'm tired and weak all the time. I have some dizziness and feel out of breath sometimes. Plus my brain just feels \"foggy\" all the time. I'm frustrated!\n\nI finally had an appointment with my family doctor on March 19 (she'd had an emergency and wasn't available for quite some time). She thinks I'm okay the way I am. She wants to keep the meds the same and thinks I need to start walking on the treadmill. I am overweight and know I need to lose weight but right now the idea of walking on a treadmill is crazy to me. I'm so tired all the time. I'm lucky to stay awake and carry on a conversation.\n\nI'm seriously considering cutting the Amlodipine down to 5 MG once a day to see if that will help. I\"m thinking it'll get me closer to the 140/90 goal that my specialist wants. Plus I've read a lot that Amlodipine can be very sedating. I'll be monitoring my bp closely and if it rises too high I'll go back to taking the 10 MG.\n\nI'm just curious if any of you have had this type of thing. Have any of you lost vision in one of your eyes due to high bp? My vision still hasn't come back, by the way. The doctors say it may but it may not, they don't really know. And, also, have any of you experienced a situation like mine where you had incredibly high bp for a long time & have now lowered it significantly? Did you feel rotten all the time? How long did it take for you body to adjust to the lower bp?","like_count":"0","tags":["High Blood Pressure"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Feeling terrible from lowered bp after incredibly high bp for years","resp_content":"The opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

These things lasted 2--3 weeks.\nThen about one year ago I had this bizarre feeling that I only had partial control of my muscles. I could walk but but I just did not feel normal. I was admitted to hosp. via ER because my symptoms looked like I was having a stroke.

I now have episodes of this tingling in left arm several times (10--12?) each day. My left arm also tingles when I lie in bed on my right side (but not left). Earlier this month (12/2016) I had the overall numbness and decreased control over my entire body, again resembling a stroke. Then 2 weeks ago I started \"feeling weird\" yet again but this bizarre feeling got increasingly worse. I tried to get on my bed because my body started jerking and I was trying to be safe.

Or is it one per vein?\"\n\nOne really wants to avoid a \"full metal jacket\", that is, in which the entire length of a native coronary artery (or bypass graft) is stented.\n\nAdditionally, clinical studies (some large-scale) have shown that, depending on the type of graft used, the individual himself or herself/individualized factors, bypass grafts may/can last from 10-15 years or longer.\n\nHowever, in some instances, grafts may/can fail early/prematurely (e.g., 1, 2 or 3 years) or even fail right after or shortly after the surgical procedure is completed.\n\nCommon venous grafts are the greater saphenous veins (GSVs) in the leg(s), which are accustomed to low pressure. Common arterial (accustomed to high pressure and are more resistant to atherosclerosis) grafts are internal mammary or thoracic arteries (in the chest, most common is the left as opposed to the right, sometimes both can be used) and radial arteries (in the arm). Uncommon graft conduits include the right gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery and the subscapular artery.\n\nSaphenous vein graft (SVG) failure after bypass surgery may be a high as 5%-10% in the first post-operative week. Disruption of graft endothelium correlates with early graft failure. The cardiothoracic surgeon should take measures during the surgery to avoid endothelial injury to the vein graft.\n\nSymptoms of a failed or collapsed bypass graft, include that of a blocked native coronary artery, which can include (when there is no, or insufficient collaterals, backup or rescue vessels) heart attack, myocardial infarction (MI, actual death or necrosis of heart muscle), which in turn can gradually, or quickly/suddenly (acutely) lead to heart failure/congestive heart failure, and sometimes sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n\nIf/when common procedures, first time or re-do, such as bypass or angioplasty, with or without stents, are not deemed feasible, there may/can be other options that includes non-invasive EECP, laser-based TMR or PMR/PMC, and gene therapy/transfer.\n\nMost important, coronary artery disease (CAD) is a life-long unpredictable (which can exhibit periods of stabilization, acceleration and even some regression) condition, requiring a continuum of care.\n\nBest of luck to your father.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD message boards DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n\nWebMD DOES NOT endorse any specifc product, service or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/43166/cabg-failure-so-soon-looking-for-answers"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Chest pain","post_content":"Some quick stats first\n\n6’3 190lbs\n\nM 30\n\nPretty sedentary life and generally poor diet but no other health issues except for some anxiety.

Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110.\n\n====>Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\n====>Sometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD message boards does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/42982/blood-pressure"},{"post":{"author":"vivmay","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Stuffy head","post_content":"I am currently on heart meds and have Copd which I do oxygen and meds for, also have a pacemaker.

One night I took my friend's hydrocodone pills (please don't judge). The next day I started feeling a weird hot feeling in my sternum (not like heartburn), then I immediately felt the urge to have a BM, went to bathroom and then started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, seeing stars. Sweating profusely, laid down on bathroom floor, then felt urge for BM again, then it just kind of happened back and forth until BM was complete - all while dry heaving too.\n\nDecember 2011 - my cousin was in the hospital after a terrible car accident, he looked awful. I had to run out of the room then collapsed in the hall and had same episode as above.\n\nSeptember/October 2012 - I was really sick, might have been the flu, took a medication prescribed to my dad to help with fever, body aches, chills. Next day I went to class, started feeling sick, so I got up to go the bathroom, I collapsed in the doorway. Started having an episode - actually threw up this time. Ambulance came, but since I was 17 and coherent I could not consent to them taking me to the ER. I do remember them saying my blood pressure was low. Went to PCP and she said the only way to tell what was going on was if I was in the middle of the episode and they took my vitals.\n\nDec. 2013/Jan. 2014 - I was getting my 2nd colonoscopy done, so the day before I had to cleanse. I probably did not hydrate enough and I definitely was not eating. Morning of the colonoscopy I had an episode.\nDecember 2016 - One night went to dinner mixed different alcohols, did not eat much food. Went on to mix very strong alcohols. Woke up still drunk, went back to sleep, then woke up again and had an episode.\n\nFebruary 2017 - Went out for bachelorette party, did not eat much dinner, mixed a lot of alcohol. Woke up drunk, then when that wore off I had an episode.\n\nSeptember 2017 - It was a normal Friday, I ate dinner and was full. I had some wine 24 hours beforehand, but did not get drunk and had plenty of water and food between. I started feeling hot and sick around 3 AM, forced self to lay down - then was taken home by a friend (I was at a retreat). When I got home I had a BM and felt better. Next day I was at lunch and I was really nervous I would have another episode. Went to a store that was a little crowded, started feeling hot and sick. Stepped outside, felt a little better, then it started hitting me. Got to car and started having episode, was able to hold in BM. Got home had BM, laid down with cool rag because I was sweating so much, but cold at the same time then fell asleep.\n\nNext 2 days I was fine, that Tuesday I was in class and started feeling sick, so I stepped outside, but it didn’t help, so I went back to class grabbed my stuff and left to go home. I was lightheaded and nauseous on my way home (which I know wasn’t smart to drive), I was sweating a lot and laid down with a cool rag then fell asleep eventually.\n\nThat Friday I went to PCP, she suggested I see a cardiologist for POTS. It was hard for me to go to the cardiologist because I was out of town at school.\n\nI had anxiety in public places because I was always scared I was going to have an episode.\n\nNovember 2017 – I was driving from Lubbock to Dallas, I had eaten a grilled cheese and a few tater tots from Sonic. About an hour into the drive I started feeling dizzy, had the burning sensation in sternum, hot, shaky, felt I needed to have a BM. My friend came and picked me up and drove me home and we got my car later.\n\nDecember 2017 – I was driving from Dallas to Lubbock, I had eaten a little bit of a sandwich, and had powerade. I started feeling the burning sensation in sternum, got dizzy, pulled over, I was hot, shaky, nauseous, and I actually had a BM – I was not anywhere near a gas station/restroom. Mom drove to pick me up, about an hour and a half out. The night before I had a glass of wine, but I ate dinner and did not feel tipsy or a buzz even.\n\nJanuary 2018 – went snowboarding. Felt bad when I woke up, ate breakfast, had BM, felt ok, started driving and about 2 miles from the hotel had to turn around because I started feeling an episode. I had another BM, then rode up front the rest of the way and felt extremely nauseous the whole drive (50 minutes).\nWhile snowboarding, a little higher on the mountain (I went on the smallest ski lift), I started feeling hot, nauseous and felt a BM, I tried to breathe and cool down, then it went away.\nThere have been a few mornings where I wake up with a racing heart and feeling very hot, but I force myself to stay laying down even though I feel very nauseous or like I need to have a BM. Eventually the feeling of hot and racing heart will calm down after 30-45 minutes, then I get up and have a BM and feel better.\n\nI finally saw a cardiologist in February and told her all my symptoms, they did orthostatic vitals, and my blood pressure is lower than normal and gets lower upon standing.

I had bloodwork done to test for magnesium and a couple other things which was all normal. I got an ETT done and I don’t think the results are back for that yet.

I would have diarrhea more often than normal, have abdominal cramping, a lot of gas build up that would cause a lot of pain, etc. I’ve had 2 colonoscopies done, which came back normal. I’ve had a hytascan which came back normal. My GI suggested chronic appendicitis and had me see a general surgeon, but the surgeon wouldn’t perform the surgery without proof of appendicitis. Then I stopped seeing the GI because I am no longer a minor and I just haven’t sought out someone new. I also had a laparoscopic exploratory surgery in my uterus to check for endometriosis, which I do not have. But before the surgery I had an ultrasound and my dr told me that I definitely have some sort of colon issue because there was a lot of built up gas in my stomach and it was hurting to press down on my stomach.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: POTS or something else?","resp_content":"\"POTS or something else?\"\n\nPostural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome is a pretty much straight forward condition to diagnose these days by a qualified doctor.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

Normal resting blood BP in male and female adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal.\n\nMore About Blood Pressure\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep blood pressure (BP) within safe/acceptable limits, but sometimes changes in lifestyle, health, stressful situations, anxiety, side effects from prescription drugs, or changes in metabolism, make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nPrehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg.

(see general info below)\n\nAbout Blood Pressure\n\nBlood pressure (BP) begins to rise as one awakens, peaks in the late afternoon or evening, and then drops off gradually, becoming the lowest when sleeping. Normal resting blood BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal.\n\nTaking BP measurements when at rest/relaxed will help yield more consistent readings. If one has had a peaceful night's sleep, then measurements are best taken as soon as one awakes in the morning, as at this time of the day, the body will be at its lowest functioning levels, both physically and mentally, and therefore the factors that affect BP will be minimized. One should try to take the BP at the same time(s) every day.\n\nPLUS, there was a study, in which University of Virginia researchers tested 100 individuals two times, once while they perched on a doctor's table, feet dangling, and then again as they sat in a chair with both feet resting on the floor and their back and arms supported.\n\nSystolic BP, the top number, dropped by 13 points on average while sitting in the chair. Why's this? According to study author Melly Turner, RN, if your arm, back, and legs are not supported, then you're exerting energy while being tested.\n\nThe prestigious American Heart Association has been recommending the chair method, but harried medical staff often don't employ it. Sit quietly in a proper chair for 5 minutes before having the BP checked, and be sure the arm being used rests on a flat surface.\n\nMore About Blood Pressure\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep blood pressure (BP) within safe/acceptable limits, but sometimes changes in lifestyle, health, stressful situations, anxiety, side effects from prescription drugs, or changes in metabolism, make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\n- - -\n\nBundle branch block\n\n(Pertinent snippets)\n\nCauses, significance and treatment\n\nBundle branch block (BBB) is a relatively frequent finding on the electrocardiogram.\n\nSometimes BBB itself needs to be treated; sometimes it indicates significant underlying cardiac disease that needs to be treated; and sometimes it has so little significance that no treatment is necessary at all....\n\nWhat is the significance of bundle branch block?\n\nBBB is quite common, and occurs in a variety of medical conditions.\n\n>>>Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) occurs in medical conditions that affect the right side of the heart or the lungs, so a finding of RBBB on the ECG ought to trigger a screening exam for such conditions. These include blood clots to the lung (pulmonary embolus), chronic lung disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial and ventricular septal defects.\n\n>>>However, RBBB also commonly occurs in normal, healthy individuals, and the screening exam therefore often turns up no medical problems. In these cases, the RBBB has no apparent medical significance, and can be written off as a \"normal variant,\" and safely ignored.\n\nhttp://www.heartdisease.about.com/cs/arrhythmias/a/BBB.htm\n\nBundle Branch Block\n\nhttp://www.texasheart.org/HIC/Topics/Cond/bbblock.cfm\n\n- - -\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is caused by increased loads on the left ventricle. Examples are high blood pressure (hypertension), aortic stenosis valve narrowing) or regurgitation (valve leakage), mitral valve regurgitation, or subaortic stenosis.\n\nLVH is a thickening of the wall of the left ventricle (LV).

I just would like you to know that when you address my concerns, you can talk to me like a medical professional instead of the average layperson. I think the below entry will illustrate this to you quite effectively versus me just saying it is so. Unfortunately, with all that knowledge I have, it is my own irresponsible and potentially self-injurious behavior, that brings us to this point. And now I can start talking...\n\nFirst just some biographic info:\n31 year old, adult male in average - below average physical condition. I currently weigh about 175 lbs and am six feet tall. I take three daily medications, 450mg Buproprion XL once daily, 600mg Gabapentin twice daily, and 5.7mg Zubsolv once a day.(more common formulation wound be Suboxone, or generic buprenorphine / nalaxone). I have been on all these drugs for about the same amount of time, approximately 7-8 years. The doses have not been changed in any way for any of them in recent years, the last being a reduction of my zubsolv 2 years ago by half. I am a semi-habitual drug user for the last 4-6 months, without any particular drug of choice at the moment. I don't discriminate other than I don't touch opiates any more - haven't once since being on the maintenance medications. I will even refuse them, and have, in the face of severe, refractory pain. I have not drunk any alcohol either for the same length of time as my abstinence from opiate drugs and pharmaceuticals. I do not wish to be moralized about drug use, and how it could be my license if I am caught, or that I could face legal / severe / other health issues, or any of the other stuff that I already know but ignore. If you can handle this, and think you know stuff about drug interaction and pharmacology, please read on and try to help me out as best you can. I already know the general answer to my ultimate question and what the safest thing to do is. However, sometimes the mind and body are telling each other something entirely different - this is one of those scenarios.\n\nDrug 11 (I will refer to it at this as the bag it came in had the number 11 on it, and only the number 11) produced dose-dependent, repeatable/reproducible increases in euphoria, awareness, concentration, and a perceived increase in general mental acuity. I have utilized amphetamine and methamphetamine in past on numerous occasions, as well as several of their analogues. The intensity of these effects produced by 11, lay somewhere right between the aforesaid drugs. Given the extraordinary noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects and their affinity for the respected receptors, and ability to cause their massive release, I believe this drug to be a probable analogue of methamphetamine. I know MDMA / MDA and other drugs like this have extraordinary similarity from a structural standpoint (as in they are both also analogues of the amphetamines), but I believe that because 11 lacks the psychedelic effects produced by and intended to occur with a good, average dose of MDMA, we are dealing with something much closer structurally to regular amphetamine or, more likely, methamphetamine. So, basically lacking an attached ring structure on the molecule. I feel that we are dealing with a drug that has a very strong affinity for noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptor binding, is causing release of their associated neurotransmitters by one of many different possible MoA, is inhibiting their re-uptake (also, take your pick as to the exact science, obviously we aren't going to know that here, sorry) or some combination thereof. I feel that the physical effects that 11 has had on me are nearly identical to a very large dose of amphetamine. This is why I leave out serotonin as a key player in 11. I know it has its role and function in the way amphetamine makes you feel while you are and aren't on it, but overall, the other two NTs are far more important in controlling MoA and drug behavior. I have yet to experience any significant down from the drug, which when I inevitably go through this, will provide me with some more potential insight into pharmacodynamic action. Potentially, this will even provide me with some (limited) insight into the pharmacokinetics, to the extent of onset and duration of action, methods of metabolism / excretion, and bioavailabilty through different RoA should I choose to utilize again.\n\nMoving onto my actual concern, despite the fact that I am a vet, I am also a recreational drug user. I often venture into drugs of unknown chemical structure (aka research chemicals, unapproved for or untested for use in human use) that have had absolutely no testing performed in any official capacity by any official organization or respectable institution. My concern is how this one chemical, that very well fits the above description, has been having some mild to moderate cardiovascular side effects. I appear to have started experiencing dose-dependent sinus tachycardia, starting at 125 and reaching as high as about 150 BPM at what I imagine was the drugs peak plasma concentration. During my first course of \"experimentation\" I administered what have, if my drug concentration was what I had even come close to achieving (25-50mg / 1mL solution) was a total dose ranging in the 50-100mg over the course of about four to five hours. The total volume of fluid administered was approximately 1.8-2.0 mL through a series of five deltoid injections, spread apart both sides of my shoulders. This was for both practical and clinical purposes, as it is my understanding that exceeding 1.0 mL in a small muscle like the deltoids can effect the muscle, as well as slow / halt the absorption of whatever the substance delivered. I also know nothing about this drugs ability to cause abscess, the result of intramuscular extravasation to the subcutaneous tissue, or any possibility of tissue necrosis. Really, just picture picking up a random white powder sent to you in the mail from someone in China, diluting it in sterile water, and seeing what happens. In an attempt to have some semblance of harm reduction practice, I start with what I hope to me considered a low-dose, and titrate upward as needed, or downward when learning the hard way.\n\nI have noted four separate, but repeatably and reliably dose-dependent (in three of them) adverse effects of 11 that support my above conclusions about how the drug works. They include dry mouth, mild to moderate nausea (no resulting vomiting or causative reasons such as vertigo or vestibular disease), sinus tachycardia, and very mild perspiration (which I believe may have been an effect of coming off the drug, that I experienced for a couple of hours before making the decision to re-administer 10 mg additional IM in a new solution made at a lower (probably about 18 - 22 mg / 1 ml solution) concentration by about 15-25% . Of all the side effects the cardiac ones were most concerning, particularly as they got more pronounced with repeated, and more frequent administration. I believe that the tachycardia was likely at its highest when the drug was at its highest point of concentration in the plasma. Without know the drug's half life and a ton of other information, were not going to know what that plasma level was, and what other cardiotoxic effects this drug could cause at even higher levels. Once again, I know this is stupid, but it's what I have been doing for a long while, and I won't be stopping unless forced to by some circumstances, physical or otherwise.\n\nAnyway, if we are operating under the assumption that this drug is moderately to markedly dopaminergic, it has the ability to cause vasodilation. I know in vet med, we use dopamine at low doses CRI (range of 1-5ug/kg/min) in order to produce cardiac positive inotropic results. It is extremely effective in doing so. While I realize that dopamine can also produce the opposite, and generally not as useful effects, at (much) higher doses, a drug such as pure crystal meth isn't even known to cause dopaminnergic bradycardia until you are in danger of overdosing. In fact, I believe that the bradycardia is the most sign and reason for fatalities associated with that drug - along with the other cardiotoxic effects it has over the long-term. While the nausea and dry-mouth I mentioned previously are typically side effects more closely-associated with serotoninergic drugs, I believe that the effects were mild and controllable because of the limited effect this neurotransmitter has on 11. I wish I had an MSDS for you, I really do, or some experimental data on a group of lab rats, but I simply don't. Just working off my own experiences with known similar drugs and a solid scientific background to try and make a decision about mixing this with another drug, one that has known vasodilatory effects. In all honestly, I would have chosen pharmacology instead of heart health had the choice been available to me on this site. However, I feel that a physician who sees lots of patients with heart problems on multiple drugs or better yet, a practicing cardiologist, would be able to give me their best guess working with the little concrete information available.\n\nAlso before I completely forget to mention, there was one other cardiac abnormality. I auscultated a grade 2/6 (that's how we grade them in vet med, don't know if its the same for human cardiology, but the number in ours just an indicator of volume; 1 is pretty much inaudible and 6 is you hear it without putting the scope on the chest, as well as having a thrill)holosystolic murmur with a PMI at the most anteromedial aspect of right second intercostal space. Knowing very little about human cardiac anatomy or physiology, I had to google where to listen on the chest to hear and assess valvular health and detect / not detect sounds. Once I had the diagram, I have a very serviceable, new and recently serviced, Littman Cardiology IV that I use daily for my own job. I feel that I am well above average in detecting low - grade, often previously unnoted murmursin dogs and cats. But I have no proficiency or point to which I can compare my ability in people to hear the same. All I can tell you is that I believe, based on point of location and time in the cardiac cycle, the murmur PMI, if truly present and not a drug induced imagination, was most likely associated with the opening of the right AV valve. Once again, having limited knowledge of human medicine, I had to look up some possible differentials for newly discovered murmurs associated with this valve. I came up with very little, finding it to be the most uncommon valve to produce murmurs, or flow issues, in adults.\n\nI have a host of wild theories and possible causes for this murmur, but the most simple thing is usually the answer in my experience. In this case, I have to imagine it was induced by the drug by one of several different mechanisms, since I was not longer able to hear it approximately three hours after I had last used drug 11. When I was still able to hear it, the other more euphoric effects were also still largely present, and seem to come down at similar rate at which they rose. The murmur was also slightly louder with a PMI spanning further right laterally on deep inspiration. No difference could be appreciated on expiration. The tachycardia was also gone (92 BPM) by three hours after the last administration of the initial solution I made up.\n\nI know this has been very long, and probably going in circles for a bit now - all a result of 11, which I am sure as a physician you likely deduced long ago. But here's my sum-up and question, and my reason for wanting to do so:\nI would like to experience some sexual arousal and see if this drug has the potential to enhance sexual experience. Failure to achieve an erection despite visual and tactile stimulation by myself and/or my girlfriend was the ultimate result. Drug 11 caused sexual excitement and desire, which obviously sucked big time in the face of temporary ED. In truth, we didn't try for too long because I knew after a couple of minutes that it simply wasn't going to happen. In addition to it feeling somewhat physiologically impossible at the time, I think I was more interested in documenting the reasons for it in my experience report. I realize that sexual side effects are usually associated with drugs effecting serotonin release, making all those anti-depressant drugs all so popular. I am theorizing that their could be low level serotonergic reuptake inhibition associated with 11, just enough to cause the unpleasant sexual side effects. So here it comes...as a result of the ED, I have been toying with taking a low oral dose of sildenafil in order to try and retake control of my ability to become aroused. I have the generic tablets in the house for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in dogs. I don't know if this will help me reach orgasm (I might find that's an entirely separate problem), but I would like to at least be able to try and say I failed. I also felt that I needed to take into effect that sildenafil having its own noradrenergic effects might have the possibility to potentiate or synergize any activity being caused by the drug 11. I read in a research paper that PDE5 inhibitors have an effect on noradrenergic nerve fibers, though the MoA was getting to be a little technical for me, even on a good day. I wasn't really sure if the MoA affecting noradrenaline release in a PDE5 I would have any effect on any drugs that are presumably noradrenergic in their effect on the brain. From what I could make of the MoA, it sounded like the noradrenergic nerve fibers of the penis were the only thing it was really directly affection.\n\nSince you are a physician reading this and can't possibly advise me to take a drug that has a tachycardic (without knowing more about why it is occurring to a certain degree of assurance), I already know you are going to recommend not to take the Sildenafil, or anything like it given my cardiovascular response. I guess what I am more interested in hearing from you is, if I plan to ignore your advise on using it in conjunction with 11, what are my chances for a reaction that is going to result in a clinically (and therefore, potentially dangerous, and cardiotoxic interaction) significant tachycardia? Given that there have been no auscultated arrhythmias, is their still a potential for the two drugs together, if working by certain MoAs, will result in one that just required some additional synergy to jumpstart things? Without knowing the MoA, in general, how common are tachyarrhythmias seen with adverse drug interactions? What type would you expect if my suspicions are close to correct about the pharmacodynamics of this structure?\n\nI don't need exact science here or true stats since I haven't provided you with experimental data or chemical information with which you would need to form such an answer. All in all, my main and most important question is, how good of a chance of there being any sort of clinically negative side effect if I stick with a dose of Sildenafil, 20 mg or less? I definitely have not even been considering taking a large, Viagra-sized dose. I have taken 20-30mg previously alone when I had to wear a condom while having sex, causing me to have weak, or nonexistent function. It worked extremely quickly and effectively at that time.\n\nI am going to stop talking now, if you got all the down here and read everything all the way through, I am proud of you.

Took Lisinopril, which knocked my systolic down from the 160s to the 140s for awhile. Recently, even with Lisinopril, was spiking close to 200. New Dr. added HCTZ (diuretic) which got it back under 150, but the 2 together make me ongoingly fatigued, and dizzy upon standing up. The new doc, nor anyone else, knows why I have such high BP. I'm underweight, not overweight, never drink or smoke, eat mostly grain, veggies and a little fish with low salt, hike in the hills regularly, semi-retired, low stress life with daily meditation, definitely don't fit the profile for hypertension. Go figure rolleyes\n\nAnyway, I've recently read about studies that show a few disconcerting conclusions about BP meds, such as:\n- they frequently don't work, even with 3 combined meds (ACE, Calcium Chain + diuretic)\n- they work for awhile but then stop, and reconfiguring meds/doses doesn't help much\n- some studies have shown they actually increase, rather than decrease, rate of heart-attack/strokes in takers, as a side effect, even if the numbers seem to go down\n- other studies show the rate of heart attack/stroke in people who ran high numbers for any length of time, then successfully brought the numbers down with the meds, had just as many heart attacks/strokes as those who never brought their numbers down, indicating that once the vascular damage is done, even if meds successfully lower your numbers from that point on, it makes little difference to the damaged veins, heart and organs\nObviously, if any of those points are accurate, the BP drug-makers don't want you to know, so some of these studies seem hard to locate, but I've seen 'em\n\nSo I'm interested in the latest accurate info about these points, from people who really know. My cardio doc isn't one of them. He's a nice guy but he just writes me scrips for the pills and says that's the only fix. Please respond and help clarify, much thanks.","like_count":"0","tags":["High Blood Pressure"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Settling conflicting info about whether BP meds help or hurt the vascular system","resp_content":"The opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140-159 and diastolic of 90-99. Stage II is systolic of 160-179 and diastolic of 100-109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nHealth dangers from blood pressure vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic or diastolic pressure (or both) is elevated, and for how long.\n\nElevated blood pressure, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic blood pressure appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic pressure is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high blood pressure from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases\n\nPulse pressure is also important, This is the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit.

No one could find anything wrong. I went to multiple ENT, MRI nothing. In January I had an upper endoscopy. I had eosinophilic esophagitis, gerd, small hiatal hernia and multiple erosions in the stomach that were bleeding. Never had stomach pain go figure. I was on omeprazole for about 8 days then I stopped it. I had a VERY hard pound in my chest. No idea what it was but nothing happened after. It did it again the next day and nothing. The third and last time it did it I started getting skipped heart beats after. The first few days I had likely a thousand a day. As time went on they got less and less now I maybe have 5 to 10 a day. I used to get palpitations from proton pump inhibits in the past so I try to not take them.\nAnyway the first day I had them I saw a cardiologist. He gave me low dose atenolol. I took it at night and when I woke up in the morning all my chest muscles and neck muscles were very stiff in the morning. As the day went on it got better. Then over the next week or so I started getting pain in my left shoulder that shot down my arm and the left side of my chest. The more I did the worse it would get. Finally one day it was terrible I called an ambulance. They did an EKG when they arrived and said it looked good. They gave me nitro and took me to the ER. They did blood work and said I was fine. This continued on and off and then I started getting pain the center of the chest low just below the sternum. During this time I started getting severe anxiety as I started thinking I was going to die any second every day. As time went on I started getting this chest discomfort right in the center of the chest. Originally I only got the pain after a painful skipped beat. Most were fine but now and then I’d get one that felt sharp and then I’d get chest pain after. Now I just get the pain all the time palpitation or no.\nWhen I have this discomfort if I go somewhere i get extreme tightness along my entire ribcage, front, back and sides. Like someone giving me a bear hug. Sometime it feels tight down my arms and into my jaw as well. I have this every day and the discomfort almost all day. I even wake up with it. To date I have had 12 EKG’s all normal.\nAs one doctor put it most people would wish their EKG looked that good. I have had a lot of blood work all normal. I had an echo, halter, stress test, and nuclear stress test all normal. The only thing they see is on the halter I get bouts of tachycardia and an occasional PAC. The cardiologist says that it looks like something is irritating the heart but he doesn’t think it’s the heart. The GI doctor says my esophagus is not the problem he said take antacids which I have tried many no help. I do not know what to do. My primary, rheumatologist and cardiologist all tell me see a shrink its anxiety/panic attacks. How can this be almost all day every day? To give an example I went to my wife’s parent’s house one day and I started getting the discomfort and shaking.\nI tried walking it off but little to no help. They asked me to help move some light chairs outside all of 10 feet. I was fine during but about 5 to 10 minutes after I got the bear hug chest tightness and started panicking badly thinking I was going to die. I tried to relax to no avail. This continued till I got home and relaxed and it went away. The next day I went outside my house determined to figure this out and I started cleaning up my yard movie 35 to 50 pound blocks and other things for about 25 minutes. No pain no tightness no problems. Next morning I woke up and chest was tight but I did do heavy lifting and it didn’t feel deep. But I was home and relaxed. Other things I have noticed is I don’t care about sex as much as I did before this and I feel worn out very often. The chest discomfort feels like it’s about an inch deep right under the sternum and makes activity tiresome. I also concentrate on my heart all day.\nNothing else really runs through my head since I always feel it I can’t concentrate on anything else but solving this. I have been to the ER 3 times they said it’s likely costocondritis but I try nsaids and nothing plus it has been going on for 3 months or so now ever since that hard POUND or whatever that was. Is there a way I have a blockage and all of those tests missed it? Or am I really going insane?\nSome extra notes about me. I am male, 34 and married with a 1 year old daughter. In my entire family tree only my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack at 57 but he also smoked for many years was very overweight 300 pounds or so and was a type 2 diabetic for at least 15 years. He did survive the heart attack and is fine now at 66.I have never smoked in my life. I do not drink. I was always very skinny and healthy but about 2 years ago I started gaining some weight. I am 6’3” and topped out at about 233 in December 2016. Now in April I am 220. I normally eat healthy LOTS of fruits and veggies. The occasional french-fry etc.\nSince I developed a wheat allergy a few years back I try to eat gluten free as best I can but it can be hard. I take zyrtec every day since I developed the wheat allergy else I get hives all over head to toe even if I stay gluten free.\nI’m not the most active person in the world since I do IT work and I’m on computers a lot but I do get out. A lot in summers. Winters here in NJ get cold. I do have ehlers danlos syndrome a connective tissue disorder but that has never affected my chest before just spine and knees/shoulders. I did have an mra in May of 2016 that saw no aneurysms in my chest. They look now and then even though I do NOT have the type that affects arteries. I just wait all day expecting to have a heart attack. I even shake my legs all day which I’m told is anxiety. I have tried Xanax but all it does is make me tired nothing else. Please help me.

The pains are either in the center or the left side of my chest, beneath my rib cage. I feel constant pressure, and it's difficult to breathe deeply. It hurts even worse when I lay flat on my back or on my right side, but it's difficult to get comfortable at all, honestly. I have shortness of breath, and I get dizzy/ light headed sometimes. The pain shoots down my left arm. My left arm was numb and tingling for a few hours on Wednesday, and there were sharp pains in my left hand and fingers, as well as numbness. Today, I feel the pain in my back, as well. Yesterday, I had a nuclear stress test. The pain increased AFTER my heart rate was supposed to drop. Therefore, my heart rate didn't slow down, and my BP was elevated. They had to inject me with something to slow my heart rate; it still took several minutes to get it below 100 bpm. After I left, the vessels on either side of my neck were throbbing and bulging and my neck hurt so badly, I thought I was going to have a stroke. I feel like the cardiologist is being dismissive because I don't smoke, I'm not obese, nor do I have hypertension or high cholesterol. However, I'm a type-A personality, and I have a high stress job (middle school English teacher). I've always been high-strung, and I have a history of anxiety dating back to childhood. I also suffer from Raynaud's and migraines. Since the chest pains started, I've noticed an increase in how often my left hand is blue (2-3 times per day, versus only when I was cold or stressed before, and it would happen in both hands and my feet) and I've had severe headaches almost every day. I have never posted on a discussion forum, but I'm so tired of feeling like this doctor isn't taking me seriously. He's got it in his mind that it's not my heart, and he's acting like he's just indulging me by ordering further tests. The EKG and echocardiogram were both normal, but I wasn't having a spasm during either test. Also, he hasn't checked my vessels, which is where I think the issue lies. Meanwhile, I had to take a leave of absence from work because I can no longer perform my job well! I thought it was weird that I would get through the whole day and then be hunched over in pain when I finally sat down for planning during the last block, as well. Although there were moments when I had to step outside of the class because I felt like I was having a minor heart attack, I had a MAJOR incident one night after playing with my dog. I ended up curled in a ball on the floor, clutching my chest. It's a shame when I don't want to go to the ER because I'm worried they're just going to send me home and tell me, \"It's not your heart.\" What else could it possibly be???

What's the best test to determine if this could be the culprit?\"\n\nVasospastic angina / coronary spasm (CAS) may/can be induced (brought on) by certain methods, such as provocation test performed with acetylcholine (ACH), and confirmed with non-invasive (echocardiography) or invasive (X-ray angiography) diagnostic imaging.\n\nAs applicable to the patient, CAS is a brief or transient constriction (narrowing) or total closure of a coronary artery, slowing down (causing cardiac ischemia) or stopping blood flow [through the afftected artery> completely during the spasm(s).\n\nAcute (sudden) or recurring CAS (vasospasm, which typically causes Prinzmetal's or variant angina), as first described by Myron Prinzmetal et. al. in 1959), is a syndrome of chest pain secondary to cardiac or myocardial ischemia.\n\nCAS typically, but not 100% always, occurs while at rest, and is mainly associated with ST-segment elevation (as seen on a routine resting ECG). Attacks occur particularly from midnight to early morning, noteworthy, probably associated with a circadian rhythm variation in the tone of the large coronary arteries.\n\nThough one of the keys to the diagnosis of CAS lies in the detection of ST-segment elevation with pain, many individuals with variant angina have episodes of asymptomatic (symptomless) ST-segment elevation.\n\nMyocardial cell (heart tissue) damage, as reflected by CK-MB levels (cardiac enzyme blood test), may/can occur in prolonged attacks of CAS.

I've been in heart failure since I was 21, I'm 24 now. If your doctors are telling you to take beta blockers you should do it. What kind of side effects are you having from them? I've taken beta blockers for years and they make me feel a lot better, it might just take some getting used to but definitely give it longer than a week.\nYou asked how much it can effect your life. I don't wanna scare you but I'm not gonna lie it effected mine ALOT. Not at first but over time it got worse. I wish I could go back and take better care of myself. You should definitely stop smoking and drinking. I know that's kinda hard at our age lol but trust me you'll be kicking yourself in the ass later if you don't start taking care of yourself now.\nYou asked how long can you live? A very long time my dude... but like I said you're gonna need to take care of yourself. Ask your doctor about diuretics, if water is backing up into your lungs that means your body is retaining water because your heart isn't pumping that good and diuretics are a medication that help get all of that extra fluid out of you. They can make you feel a lot better.\nWith heart failure there is always a threat of cardiac arrest, not that much from heart attacks but from arrhythmias. If your resting heart rate is 165 bpm then you are at risk for arythmias. Getting a defribulator implanted can literally save your life if you have an arrhythmia. It's saved my life a few times. I know it's a lot to to take in and it can be overwheelming but it's not the end of the world. You can live a long healthy life if you do the things you're supposed to do like take your meds, take care of yourself and get a defibrillator. I've been through all of this stuff myself, if you ever wanna talk or have any questions just email me at Austinnn93@outlook.com. I'm more than happy to tell you anything you want to know. By the way if your doctor didn't recommend diuretics and a defribulator then I'd suggest getting a new doctor. Look up heart failure specialists in your area. You can beat this man you just gotta take charge and live your life the right way. Don't let it get you down... young people like us have the best shot at beating heart failure.

Nothing changed. To try and cut a long story short, ever since then my life has been a living hell and the pain has gotten worse, more frequent and more widespread.

My average blood pressure on 2 different meds is 150/90.\"\n\nIn general-only here, normal resting blood pressure (BP) in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\n====>Health dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\n===>High systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\n====>High diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD message boards DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"},{"author":"richardddawson","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Blood pressure and stroke","resp_content":"Maybe you can use some help of https://www.essay-have.com/ here.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little.

A few weeks ago, I was suffering from bad swollen tonsils, bad sore throat, small fever, and chills (Chills were accompanied with smaller veins on my hands and feet; smaller than usual). I tested negative for strep and negative for mono, but my primary doctor suggested that I had CMV. My blood pressure was a little higher than usual, but my doctor did not see it as a problem (I am in the average range for vitamin/blood levels; overall, very healthy).

He didn't seem worried about how my hand veins were appearing smaller during parts of the day, also. Luckily, the tonsils/throat/fever all improved within the next week and I am feeling much better now.

RBBB means Right Bundle Branch Block, an electrical conduction abnormality.\n\nBundle branch block\n\nCauses, significance and treatment\n\nBundle branch block (BBB) is a relatively frequent finding on the electrocardiogram.\n\nSometimes BBB itself needs to be treated; sometimes it indicates significant underlying cardiac disease that needs to be treated; and sometimes it has so little significance that no treatment is necessary at all....\n\nWhat is the significance of bundle branch block?\n\nBBB is quite common, and occurs in a variety of medical conditions.\n\n***Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) occurs in medical conditions that affect the right side of the heart or the lungs, so a finding of RBBB on the ECG ought to trigger a screening exam for such conditions. These include blood clots to the lung (pulmonary embolus), chronic lung disease, cardiomyopathy, and atrial and ventricular septal defects.\n\n>>>However, RBBB also commonly occurs in normal, healthy individuals, and the screening exam therefore often turns up no medical problems. In these cases, the RBBB has no apparent medical significance, and can be written off as a \"normal variant,\" and safely ignored.\n\nhttp://www.heartdisease.about.com/cs/arrhythmias/a/BBB.htm\n\nBundle Branch Block\n\nhttp://www.texasheart.org/HIC/Topics/Cond/bbblock.cfm\n\n.\n\nThe opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

When it happens, I get a little dizzy and start seeing dots in front of me. I also get chest and back of neck pain.

I asked my biology teacher about this and she told me that this is an adrenaline rush, and a doctor told me that it's normal for this to happen when I'm playing sports or anxious, but she doesn't understand that it SUDDENLY starts and stops. Could this be related to random moments when I'm casually doing something and my heart just skips a beat? This morning, this \"adrenaline rush\" happened for literally 4-5 beats and then stopped (or so I think, maybe I was dreaming).

Not a gas type pain. It was like someone was wringing or stabbing the area where my esophagus met my stomach or something. It was absolutely debilitating and brought me to my knees. It felt like something was really wrong. I stood up and stretched my arms over my head and it kind of mitigated the pain a bit, which got me thinking it was muscular? I was having some difficulty breathing, not because something was cutting off my airway, but because inhaling felt like it was pulling on something and prevented me from inhaling all the way. I kept pacing around my living room, then sitting down and rocking in the fetal position to try and find a position that made it stop, but I couldn't find one. Then it just kind of went away on it's own for a few minutes, then came back, then went away, then came back, then finally went away and hasn't come back since last night.\nI'm obviously no expert, but could this have been a diaphragm issue?

I’ve done multiple EKG’s in the past, with most of them reading “normal”. But a couple of them read “abnormal LVH”. I’ve done a little research, and what I gained was that LVH is basically a enlarged valve. I followed up and did a ultrasound of my heart, and everything came back as normal. A couple things worry me though. 1- my blood pressure sometimes spikes to 140/73. I know the bottom number is good, but the top number is not. However I am always extremely nervous when I take my blood pressure. 2- I am ALWAYS aware of my heartbeat it seems like, and I’m constantly checking my pulse. It’s the worse when I lay down on my back. I had a major panic attack back in feb 2017, where I felt like I was dying and I couldn’t catch my breath. I think it’s important to point out that I was taking adderall (prescribed not recreational) 20mg extended release during this time. And I was convinced to smoke some weed (I know, stupid) and that’s when the panic attack happened. It was horrible, and I’ve had major anxiety ever since. I had no chest pain during this attack, however my pulse was through the roof, my limbs and face were tingling and I couldn’t breathe. I did not pass out though. What I want to know is this. How can I treat this? I have not taken any adderall since that day, barely drank any alcohol, and I’m never touching weed again. But I need some help, it still feels like I have some underlying heart issue. By the way, I am a 24 year old male in great shape. Work out almost everyday. I use to be a competitive swimmer for 12+ years if that has anything tp do with it. My family has no history of heart disease, but my mom does have anxiety. The thing that bothers my the most is the heartbeat awareness.

My heart rate on a daily basis has been 113-135. I've struggled with sever depression since the clots were found, too. I had a baby march 3 2015 and gained a lot of weight. I'm now 180 and yes I am a smoker no I don't drink because I'm not able to while on the med's I'm currently taking. I'm currently prescribed to Eliquis, MetFormin, Lamictal, Olanzapine, Klonopin, albuterol, alli, Vyvanse, advair and bentyl. My medical issues include epilepsy, IBS, ADHD, major depression, PTSD, asthma, polycystic ovarian disease, raynauds,non-alcoholic chronic liver disease, kidney stones and my hematologist is still trying to figure out where the clots came from. My BP has been anywhere from 129/89-159/107. I've had many panic attacks in the past couple weeks and chest pain. Sunday I started back at the gym and went back Mon and Tues. All I did was walk on the treadmill. I walked at a minimum speed of 2.7 and my heart rate was in the 140's. I took the speed up to 3.2 and my heart rate went up to 150's-172. I made the incline 8 and walked at a speed of 3.4 and my heart rate went up to 170. So, I took it back down to no incline at a speed of 2.9 for about 10 min. and my heart rate was still between 160 and 174. I've been having a lot of trouble breathing since Sunday. I only use my albuterol inhaler as needed. I've been using it at least 3x a day with 2 puffs. My left leg and arm into my hand have really been bothering me pretty bad today. My chest, mid and left side continue to feel tight and like there's a boulder on my chest. My neck and between my shoulder blades and in my jaw on both sides have hurt pretty bad all day. Last night when I was at the gym the left side of my face had goosebumps and I was literally pouring sweat. I've been stretching and trying to get the pain to go away but nothing not even Tylenol works. I'm in a lot of pain and every time the EMT's come get me due to high blood pressure which causes me to have horrible migraines, I get to the hospital they check for clots and then I'm given medicine to make my migraine go away but they're not treating me or admitting me for the cause of the migraine which is high blood pressure. I 'd hate to go back to the ER just for them to do go through the whole process that I continue to go through and my GP is out today and I'm yet to find a cardiologist..

This is a hypothesis, but you need to CHECK.\n\n- So... figure out a protocol for yourself, with a professional nutritionist (for diet) and a professional physical therapist (for exercise : what kind, how much, how often), and then check the results with an angiography (every 2 years? every 5 years? Assess the risks and decide).\n\n- See if it's working or not... and if it's not, then, you need the medication because we're talking about stroke and heart attack down the road...\n\n- But then, is there a way to use LESS medication because of your lifestyle, would that be a reasonable compromise?\n\n- Or what if there ARE natural remedies / supplements out there that dramatically decrease cholesterol levels?\n\nI want to wish you all the best with this research. This is a serious disease and your decision is very unusual.\n\nIt's important that you keep precise records of what you do.\n\nIf you succeed, you can share your protocols and maybe help others. If you don't succeed, it's still useful to share what you've tried and what the results were. It can help others make their own choices.\n"},{"author":"kokomo3x7","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) Natural Treatment?","resp_content":"Hi again,\nIt seems like you might be right about the testosterone levels!?!!!\nhttp://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2006/7/atd/Page-01\n\nSo hormonal therapy would be a better avenue, without all the damaging side effects of drugs... ?\n\nHere you'll find good supplement tips (the author has FH)\nhttp://www.theconfidencekitchen.com/my-cholesterol-lowering-diet/\n\nAll the best!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/4532/familial-hypercholesterolemia-fh-natural-treatment"},{"post":{"author":"curtis121273","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"I need blood work done asap","post_content":"can i go in a walk in lab and request it myself or does a doctor have to do it\nThey are not responding to me and there is a good chance I have a tumor on my adrenal gland\nI needseveral tests done high protein\nmetanephrines\nTsh\nthyroid hormone\nspecific gravity urine poc\nurine ph poc\nleukcyte estererase\nepithelial\nsquamous epithilial cells\nis what I know as of now\nand CBC\npleasse help I live in york pa","like_count":"0","tags":["High Blood Pressure","Heart Failure","Heart Attack","Heart Disease","Cholesterol Control"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: I need blood work done asap","resp_content":"Usually a doctor has to do it.\n\n\"There is a good chance I have a tumor on my adrenal gland\"\n\nDo see a qualified doctor as soon as possible.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/32712/i-need-blood-work-done-asap"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Help","post_content":"I am a healthy 15 y/o female, with no pre-existing conditions.

My left chest has been hurting for the past 8 months or so. It's hard to describe, but it's a relatively numb pain with intensity that ebbs and tides yet is fairly consistent in it's presence. It sometimes becomes a bit sharp and extends to my back/shoulder. I also experience  shortness of breath and cannot run or exercise intensely any longer, which is disappointing because I really enjoy running/hiking/skiing/other sports.  I can walk downhill without problems, but walking or running uphill is very difficult and causes me to become breathless.  Even walking up a flight of stairs can leave me breathless, when prior to this I was able to hike four miles up a mountain in an hour without issues.\nSometimes I have difficulty catching my breath, even without exercise.\n\nI also experience palpitations in my chest. I feel nearly every heartbeat, and I could probably determine my pulse without pressing my fingers to my body.  The pain is not affected by moving.  I feel a similar pain when I breathe in VERY deeply, but normal breathing does not change the pain.   The pain is not palpable.  Pressing or massaging the left side of my chest does not change the pain.\n\nThere were three things that immediately preceded the onset of this pain, and I am not sure which is to be blamed.  The pain began a few days after I returned from a long flight across the country, during which I was in the same plane seat for 9 hours each way.  When I returned, I had a possible case of pneumonia during which I coughed heavily and constantly coughed up mucus.  I will also admit that I first smoked marijuana around this time.  I let the smoke sit in my lungs for a few seconds before exhaling, and I was coughing heavily.  I also experienced a rapid heart rate, palpitations and heavy left-side chest pain while intoxicated.  I have not smoked marijuana since.\n\nI visited the ER 7 months ago (about 10 days after onset) convinced that I was having a heart attack or something, and an EKG, bloodwork and chest x-ray all came up negative.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or SPIKE up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\n====>Normal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high SPIKES in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from blood pressure vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic or diastolic pressure (or both) is elevated, and for how long.\n\nElevated blood pressure, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renovascular disease.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.Hi:\n\n.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD Community Member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Most often, Heart Patients go through the dilemma of choosing between two treatments i.e. Bypass Surgery vs Angioplasty Surgery.

A few days ago I had my first panic attack, called the ambulance and went to the hospitals. All the tests showed my heart was okay and this was a panic attack. After I went to the hospital, I had 4 more panic attacks in a row in 1 hour. They were scary!\n\nI was not convinced though, because how would panic disorder create this strange feeling in my heart? I've done some research and found out that A LOT of people with panic disorders have the exact same feeling in their heart. And it was caused by excessive amount of adrenalin in the blood, causing the heart to work harder and in the end, tiring it.\n\nAnd, I've done lots of research about heart failure and I know that it's caused by an over-working heart. So... As a result of this adrenalin - over-working heart muscles, can I expect heart failure in the future if I don't cure my panic disorder? Everyone says panic disorder is harmless. But what about my heart? If my heart works harder every minute, doesn't that mean that I'll have heart failure in the future?\n\nThanks in advance.","like_count":"0","tags":["Heart Failure"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Could panic disorder lead to heart failure?","resp_content":"Heart failure, no, not necessarily.\n\nDo consult with your doctor first and foremost for ALL your medical concerns or worries.\n\n...\n\nThe opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

The ‘strange feeling’ in your chest and the fast heartbeat are common with panic attacks and can go away with treatment. You don’t need to worry about long term heart damage from panic attacks.\nSecond, panic disorder is not harmless. The fear and anxiety associated with panic attacks can be debilitating and impact the quality of your life. Luckily, treatment can be effective.\nSounds like you’ve been to the ER once, and have done research online. Now, I’d recommend you visit your doctor to talk about the panic attacks. She'll decide if any tests or evaluations are necessary. She can confirm that you have panic disorder, and then discuss with you treatment options.\nPanic disorder is treated with a type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It can also be treated with antidepressant medication. Here’s an article on our website that may help you, What Is Panic Disorder? https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-panic-disorder#1\nPanic disorder can be a tough illness to get under control, but you’re asking questions so that’s great.

I've been having weird symptoms and feel like I'm not being properly diagnosed by my doctor.\n\nI'm in the military stationed in 29 Palms and our medical staff is notorious for misdiagnosing patients.\n\nRecently I returned from 6 months in Japan and started experiencing weird symptoms that led to a full on panic attack. I've never had a panic attack before. These symptoms appeared right after a weekend of heavy drinking where in my drunken state I forced myself to vomit multiple times. Not sure if it's related but that's the exact weekend it started.\n\nSymptoms: hard to really explain, the best I can say is a constant weird sensation in the middle of my chest. Not really pain more of just an extremely weird feeling. This is followed sometimes by a weirder feeling on the left side of my chest. I understand this is vague, but it almost just feels like a muscle twitch or movement inside if my chest. Sometimes I get shortness of breathe out of nowhere, just sitting or laying down. I also suddenly have trouble sleeping because I can feel my pulse beating in my finger tips and ears while trying to fall asleep. Not beating faster just \"harder\". I believe all this led to me having a couple anxiety/panic attacks.\n\nSo I've been to the ER after one of these attacks because I was afraid I was going to pass out alone in my room and it was 2AM. I complained of pain in my chest and shortness of breathe, they ran an EKG and a chest xray and found nothing abnormal.\nThe labs they ran showed nothing abnormal other than my thyroid gland pumping out more hormones than it's supposed to, I believe they said my T3 and T4 were elevated.\nSeeing my assigned medical officer he diagnosed me with anxiety and heartburn/GIRD. Prescribed me Zantac and Atarax.\n\nMy issue is my symptoms haven't gone away at all, I constantly feel irregular. The feeling in my chest almost never goes away and I'm honestly afraid that something more serious than heartburn is going on. The cause of the anxiety is the wierd chest sensations start making me think there's an issue with my heart, but they are telling me the chest sensations are being caused by the anxiety which I believe isn't true. I feel it at all times no matter what I'm doing.\n\nI went from having no medical issues to all of a sudden having every aspect of my life interrupted by this and they want me to believe it's heartburn just because they listened to my chest with a stethoscope. On top of that there's a common trend here of misdiagnosis because there are a lot of fakers trying to get out of training by faking symptoms, so they tend to give you ibuprofen and send you on your way. I have no problem training I just want to feel normal again.\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated.","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/31925/concerned-about-diagnosis"},{"post":{"author":"bufalodog","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"resting heart rate higher than normal","post_content":"my heart rate is 140 at rest, is this dangerous, I am 60 years old, it is usually 70 to 80 beats per minute?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"cardiostarusa1","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: resting heart rate higher than normal","resp_content":"Hi:\n\n\"My heart rate is 140 at rest\"\n\n\"Is this dangerous?\"\n\nNot necessarily, though do consider consulting with a doctor, preferably a cardiologist on this.\n\nNormal resting range heart/pulse rate in adults is 60-100 beats per minute (BPM).

As soon as the heart starts to race, tighten the stomach muscles. This will cause the abdominal muscles to put pressure on a group of nerves that will tell the heart's electrical coduction system to slow down.\n\nChill. Take a deep, long breath and slowly let it out. Sometimes relaxation is all it takes to stop tachycardia. And deep breathing is frequently one of the fastest ways to relax.\n\nUse common sense. Anything that speeds up the heart, caffeine and cigarettes, for example, can trigger a rapid heartbeat. So common sense says that if one is prone to tachycardia, one should avoid any substance that might give the heart an extra kick.\n\n_ . _\n\n\nLEARN ABOUT the Heart\n\nWebMD\n\nThe Heart: (Human Anatomy) Pictures, Definition, Location in the Body and Heart Problems\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart\n\nHeartSite\n\nHeart info, diagnostic tests info, actual diagnostic images.\n\nhttp://www.heartsite.com\n\n-\n\nQuote!\n\nBe a questioning patient.

Your doctor will usually decide what medicine to start based on how high your blood pressure is and other medical problems that you may have.\n\nUsually, your body needs time to adjust to new medicines and new doses. Metoprolol is a type of medicine that lowers your blood pressure and also lowers how hard and fast your heart beats. Some people feel tired after they start taking it. It can take several days to see changes in your blood pressure.\n\nGive yourself about a solid week to let your body get used to it. After that your doctor will be able to make changes if needed. Check in with your doctor right away if you are having chest pain, severe fatigue, trouble breathing or swelling in your hands and feet. Always make sure to follow up with your doctor regularly, even if you feel fine, because they will want to make sure that your heart rate and blood pressure are in a safe range on this medicine.\n\nAll the best!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/30898/how-long-for-my-meds-to-start-working"},{"post":{"author":"lviewchiguy","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"High heart rate/Low Blood Pressure","post_content":"This is a question for my g.f.

Can anxiety cause high heart rate with low blood pressure? Can this this related to anxiety, or is it something possible in the nervous system?

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 (top number is systolic, pressure exerted on the vessel walls when the heart pumps and botton number is diastolic, pressure exerted when the heart is at rest) with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

Low BP (hypotension) is defined as being under 90/60.\n\nThe basics\n\nSome individuals normally have low BP, and is ok for them, as it doesn't cause any symptoms. They feel fine and function normally.\n\nAs reported, as applicable, low-to-very-low BP may/can quickly become a problem. If/when BP goes too low, there's a danger that the body is not getting enough oxygen-carrying blood.\n\nNormal body functions such as breathing/respiration, movement, and brain function/activity can be impaired and damage may/can even occur.\n\nSeverely low BP can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to dreaded shock, an absolutely life-threatening condition/situation.\n\nLow BP may/can also cause generally concerning symptoms such as lightheadedness or dizziness, tiredness, sleepiness, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, confusion, and syncope (which includes fainting and passing out).\n\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n\nHypotension\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hyp/hyp_whatis.html\n\n\nL@@K back in the Media\n\nLow Blood Pressure Dangers - Media Coverage Ignores Health Risk\n\nhttp://www.thehealthierlife.co.uk/natural-health-articles/high-blood-pressure/low-blood-pressure-dangers-00731.html\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD Member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/30108/bp-and-heart-rate-problems"},{"post":{"author":"thatonedudemydudes","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Which Hand...","post_content":"Has A More Direct Blood Flow To The Heart?\nI ask this question for research purposes.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/30036/which-hand"},{"post":{"author":"thatonedudemydudes","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Which Hand Has A More Direct Blood Flow To The Heart?","post_content":"Which Hand Has A More Direct Blood Flow To The Heart?\nI ask this question for research purposes.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/30035/which-hand-has-a-more-direct-blood-flow-to-the-heart"},{"post":{"author":"tcsolum","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Concerns about Lisinopril","post_content":"I had a heart attack on 8/24/17.

These include delivery issues due to the thicker struts, stent recoil, the limited ability to over-expand without breaking struts, the need for very precise sizing, and poor outcomes if the Absorb is used in coronary vessels 2.5 mm or smaller.\n\nPerhaps the biggest barrier to wider adoption was the much higher price tag for Absorb over traditional metallic DES.

Assured me that she wasnt going to be the one to do the cath, dont know why she felt she had to tell me that. I am also due for another colonoscopy, since polyps were found with the one 6 years ago. I asked the first doctor, which I should do first, she left it up to me to decided. So I did, the GI would not do the colonoscopy, because she recommeded the heart cath first, the anetheologist agreed.

Normal resting blood BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal.\n\nTaking BP measurements when at rest/relaxed will help yield more consistent readings. If one has had a peaceful night's sleep, then measurements are best taken as soon as one awakes in the morning, as at this time of the day, the body will be at its lowest functioning levels, both physically and mentally, and therefore the factors that affect BP will be minimized. One should try to take the BP at the same time(s) every day.\n\nPLUS, there was a study, in which University of Virginia researchers tested 100 individuals two times, once while they perched on a doctor's table, feet dangling, and then again as they sat in a chair with both feet resting on the floor and their back and arms supported.\n\nSystolic BP, the top number, dropped by 13 points on average while sitting in the chair. Why's this? According to study author Melly Turner, RN, if your arm, back, and legs are not supported, then you're exerting energy while being tested.\n\nThe prestigious American Heart Association has been recommending the chair method, but harried medical staff often don't employ it. Sit quietly in a proper chair for 5 minutes before having the BP checked, and be sure the arm being used rests on a flat surface.\n\nMore About Blood Pressure\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep blood pressure (BP) within safe/acceptable limits, but sometimes changes in lifestyle, health, stressful situations, anxiety, side effects from prescription drugs, or changes in metabolism, make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nSometimes, high BP can suddenly become a \"hypertensive crisis\", which is described as when diastolic is greater than 120, and there are signs or symptoms of damage to the brain, heart, kidneys or other organs. If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nBest of luck down the road of life.

When correlated with a patient’s personal information, the score can yield an estimation of a patients risk for coronary artery disease.\n\nThe problem with arterial calcification is that it is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation, though soft plaque (easier to perform angioplasty and stenting on, typically for blockages of 70/75% or greater) is more dangerous and unpredictable than hard or calcified plaque.\n\nNoteworthy, back in April 2007, in animal studies, it showed that high levels of vitamin K resulted in a 37% reduction in calcium buildup in the arteries. This first-in-animals study also showed that decreased arterial elasticity can be reversed as well.\n\nOf course, what works well in animals does not mean that it will translate into a clinical benefit in humans.\n\nVitamin K is found in many kinds of foods, and is also available in dietary supplement form, though in some cases, this can do more harm than good (due to side effects, or interactions with drugs, e.g., Coumadin).\n\nThough coronary artery disease (CAD) is a lifelong unpredictable condition (requiring a continuum of care), it has been reported, that in some individuals, it's possible to halt or even reverse/regress atherosclerotic plaque to some degree, through lifestyle changes, customized prescription drug-therapy, strict or specialized diet (e.g., Ornish), exercise regimen, and stress management.\n\nWebMD Health News - archives\n\nCalcium in Arteries May Predict Heart Risk\n\nStudy Shows a Calcium Score May Be Helpful Tool in Predicting Heart Disease - April 27, 2010\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20100427/calcium-in-arteries-may-predict-heart-risk\n\nCalcium in Arteries Signals Heart Death\n\nCalcium Buildup Could Lead to Sudden Cardiac Death Within 5 Years - 8/27/03\n\nCalcium in the coronary arteries has always been bad news, signaling the onset of heart disease.\n\nOften No Warning Signs\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20030827/calcium-arteries-death\n\nAbout risk factors / Statins\n\nAs reported, it is known that a risk factor merely increases the probability that one will develop cardiovascular disease, BUT doesn't 100% guarantee that one will develop it, nor does its absence (or even the absence of ALL known risk factors) 100% guarantee that one won't have a heart attack or brain attack.\n\nAlso, as reported, in some individuals, it's possible to halt or reverse atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries to some degree, through lifestyle changes, statin-therapy (**typically high-dose as seen in clinical trials), strict, uniquely-customized or highly-specialized diet (e.g., Ornish), exercise regimen, and stress management.\n\nL@@K Back in the Media\n\n**Intensive Cholesterol Lowering With Atorvastatin Halts Progression Of Heart Disease, Cleveland Clinic-Led Study Shows\n\n'REVERSAL' Trial\n\nThe REVERSAL trial, compared the highest doses available at the time of two popular statin drugs, pravastatin and atorvastatin....\n\n\"When we analyzed the results of REVERSAL, we realized that we had found an approach to coronary disease treatment that could LITERALLY STOP heart disease in its tracks\"......\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intensive-cholesterol-lowering-with-atorvastatin-halts-progression-of-heart-disease-cleveland-clinic-led-study-shows-58752172.html\n\nAdditionally, as reported, the symptoms of artery-narrowing atherosclerosis are highly variable. Those with mild atherosclerosis may present with clinically important symptoms and signs of disease and heart attack, or absolute worst case scenario, sudden cardiac death may be the first and only symptom of coronary artery disease. However, many individuals with anatomically advanced disease may have no symptoms and experience no functional impairment.\n\nMost important, vulnerable plaque (which was reported on the program 20/20 on abc TV some years back, the cause of the majority of heart attacks via bursting or rupturing), hides well-away within the vessel wall (causing no symptoms), and thus can't be seen with invasive X-ray angiography/angiogram/heart catheterization.\n\nOn the positive side, statins may/can stabilize vulnerable plaque (VP), though on the negative side, some individuals may/can experience side effects/adverse reactions, such as memory loss, muscle aches/pains. On an individualized case-by-case basis, the benefits of taking a statin, at any dose, must clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nAdditionally, statins also have anti-inflammatory properties and as applicable to the patient, thus lowers C-reactive protein (CRP/hs-CRP).

Identifiable parts or sections of the aorta include the aortic root, ASCENDING (goes upward) aorta, aortic arch (curved portion at the top of the aorta), descending aorta (going downward), thoracic aorta (chest area) and the abdominal aorta (stomach area).\n\nDiseased aortic tissue is characterized by degeneration of the cells composing the aortic wall. This diseased tissue is weak, lacking sufficient elastic components to stretch and contract well.\n\nThe first indication of this abnormality may be a localized enlargement/dilation in the area of weakness.

I am a 23 year old female. I have had strong pain in both my lower legs (calves and shins) for quite a while now. It all started around 2-3 years ago. Everytime I walked at a faster pace, my calves would cramp and hurt extremely until I sit down or pause in the middle of the road. The pain gets so bad that I feel like my both feet are going completely numb from the pain and that I would have to drag them around. I don´t have any pain when resting. Except that I get a weird pain in my left front thigh when I sit down with my legs straight. The walking pain has changed my life to the worse. I simply cannot walk fast and without breaks. It makes me go late to school and if I force myself to ignore the pain it gets so bad that I cry from the pain. It has gotten much worse the past few months. I have had periods without any pain at all but I don´t understand why.\nOkay, so now you think I am probably STILL too young to have PAD and that it is probably something else. But there is a huge problem. I have had severe depression for the past seven years and have barely left my house except for school. I sit all the time and I have been a strong smoker for years. Due to all the inactivity I have gained around 30kg since my depression kicked in.\nI am now obese (164cm, 90kg), a heavy smoker (25 cigarettes a day for years) and I barely do anything else than sitting infront of the pc and school. I am almost sure that it´s PAD (Peripheral artery disease) and it makes me incredibly terrified and depressed. I have talked to my doctor but she didn´t seem to take it seriously until now. I am waiting for an appointment with a specialist. But the fear is overcoming my senses and I dread the outcome. I am so scared that my concerns are true and that my life quality will greatly sink because of what I did to myself for years...\nI have to mention that I have a severe health anxiety and usually I would force myself to not dread the worst possible outcome but I can´t help it this time...

Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110.

If/when applicable, quick-acting drugs can be administered in the ER setting to reduce BP.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high spikes in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase).

To begin with I really don't know whether to describe it as a flutter, palpitation, skipped beat, extra beat or what so bear with me.\n\nSince my 30's I remember having sporadic heart palpitations, not often but nevertheless noticeable to me. There have been times where they became more often for a period of months and then went back to \"normal\".\n\nBack when I was a university student I once became so angry with my roommate that I got heart palpitations for a few seconds. This scary feeling has been with me all my adult life, I am 54 now.\n\nI am hypothyroid on a relatively low dosage (250 ug/week) since 2007. Additionally -an probably because of thyroid problem- I also have low Free Testosterone (not a lot but under the range) and I read that testosterone can cause heart issues as well.\n\nAdditionally to that, I usually have low heart rate of around 54-57 beats per minute (rest). I do not suffer from High Blood Pressure, in fact my BP tends to be relatively low 110/70, 102/79, 121/80, etc.\n\nHaving said that, in the past months I have come to another period where these palpitations have become more often. It can happen several times during the day (a few times at night) and can feel like a few beats, irregular beat, a thump, etc. the feeling varies I would say.\n\nUsually it is just an event that last only a beat or two and that is it. In the past few months I had a couple of occasions when it actually lasted like 3 or 4 seconds.\n\nDuring the events I NEVER felt dizzy, nor fainted, nor became disoriented, nor tired, at most I feel a bit breathless because of the anxiety this terrible feeling causes. I have also NEVER felt chest or shoulder pain.\n\nAlthough I am not a regular exerciser, I used to cycle every day, my work is more sitting at the computer. I do make the effort to walk 1.5 kilometers one or more times in a week, sometimes I go for a 4 km walk and quite frankly I do it happily and without feeling tired before, during or after the long walks at relatively higher pace (5.5 km/h) than most people walk, I just can't stand to walk slowly.\n\nIf I get angry or excited when talking I can get an extra beat or two. I am NOT overweight, in fact for my height (1.84 meters) I am nearly bordering underweight (65 Kg). My belly isn't large, I am slender though my belly is the only place were \"fat\" accumulates. But, sometimes when I kneel for example, or tense my tummy like to pull it in, then I get this \"event\" as well. Not always but I have noticed it happens on some of those occasions. My cholesterol levels are also good, I do not take any medication for blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI sometimes go to the gym and use the static bicycle for half an hour at different levels of resistance. Sure, I sweat a lot when I do that but at the end I am neither tired nor breathless.\n\nAt one time years ago I was taking vitamin supplements and I noticed an increase in the \"events\". I don't know if it was coincidental or what. I stopped taking them. A few weeks ago I started D3 and B12 supplements.\n\nYears ago (2008) when I was having them more often I had a chest X Ray (don't have it) and a Holter for 24-hours. The DX was that there were some events but that they were not significant.\n\nSeveral months ago I had an EKG that had Dx of \"early repolarization\" and \"sinus bradycardia\" but other than that it did not indicate anything else so I was NOT referred to a cardiologist.\n\nBut as I said, these events keep happening and I am very worried about it. I do not know if it is a heart condition or a hormone imbalance or vitamin imbalance or what.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"cardiostarusa1","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Palpitations scaring me","resp_content":"Hi:\n\nAs mentioned here often, the most common type of palpitations, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, occurs even in many heart-healthy individuals), described that the heart is flip-flopping, jumping, pausing or stopping briefly (though it's actually not doing that), pounding, skipping, thumping, or strong, hard, or forceful beats being felt in the chest, neck, throat, has various causes (cardiac and non-cardiac) or triggers.\n\nPVCs, are typically harmless/BENIGN, be it isolated (single), couplets (2-in-row), triplets (3-in-a-row) or salvos (short bursts of 3 or more in-a-row), bigeminy (occurring every other beat), trigeminy (occurring every third beat), quadrigeminy (occurring every fourth beat), etc., etc.\n\nHowever, the main problem or concern (even more so, much more emphasized for those with certain major or serious heart conditions) with PVCs is when sustained ventricular tachycardia (runs of PVCs over 30 seconds) occurs.\n\nSymptoms that may/can occur with PVCs includes none at all or chest pain/discomfort/pressure/tightness, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness or dizziness, and in uncommon to rare cases, near-syncope or syncope (temporary loss of consciousness, includes fainting and passing out).\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBe well-informed\n\nMedicineNet - We Bring Doctors' Knowledge to You\n\nPalpitations (PACs, PVCs)\n\nhttp://www.medicinenet.com/Palpitations/article.htm\n\n-\n\nQuote!\n\n\"Be a questioning patient.

The only reason this was discovered was because I've been to the ER due to feeling absolutely horrible for several weeks. I've been totally exhausted- unable to exercise for more than a few minutes without wheezing, dizziness, profuse sweating, and chest tightness. Along with the anemia, it was clear that I am also in the first trimester of pregnancy. This complicates both the symptoms of the anemia and the available treatment options for it. Of course, a developing fetus demands iron and blood flow from the body, which strains the heart on top of the lack of oxygen and overworking of the heart that are present with the anemia. My problem is this: despite the fact that I've told my doctor about the chest pains and difficulty breathing, she didn't actually give me any advice. Given the situation, I think I should have some sort of protocol to follow in case I'm having really severe symptoms. A walk from my car, up 16 stairs, and through the door of my apartment should not leave me unable to breathe properly for SEVERAL MINUTES, while I literally feel like I am DYING. Not exaggerating this here, it's that bad. After this walk, I'm usually covered in sweat and can only manage to collapse onto my bed, breathing like I'd just run countless miles. There's no way that's normal! Anemia and the complications of it have very little publicity or information available online, I've noticed, but I really think this isn't right.

Average is 72-78 BPM in men and 78-84 BPM in women. Over 100 BPM is tachycardia (fast heartbeat).\n\nAbout Blood Pressure\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep blood pressure (BP) within safe/acceptable limits, but sometimes changes in lifestyle, health, stressful situations, anxiety, side effects from prescription drugs, or changes in metabolism, make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or spike up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\n====>Normal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal.

Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little.

If/when side effects occur, this may/can diminish or disappear as the body adjusts itself to the drug, though sometimes, one will simply not be able to tolerate a certain drug (or drugs) at all, at any dose.\n\nFactors and conditions such as age height, weight, gender, genetics and metabolism may/can come into play in determining who experiences side effects and who does not.\n\nPharmacogenomics, the study of the interplay between genes and drugs, helps to explain why prescription drugs have different effects in different individuals. Genetic variation in one or more genes may be the basis for a therapeutic failure or for an adverse drug reaction.\n\nWithout lowering the dosage (unless applicable), sometimes, taking a particular prescription drug at a different time of the day or taking it with food may/can improve the side effect-related situation.\n\nSometimes, changing to another same-class drug or taking a lower dose of the drug along with another class of drug (for a combo-action) may/can impove the side effect-related situation.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

I have been to so many doctors and hospitals in the last 8 years. I have scoured the internet. I can't find an answer to my problems. I have fought tooth and nail for my health, but lately, the fight is going out of me because doctor after doctor just shrug and send me elsewhere. It is hard to find hope when no one knows how to fix you.\n\nI am a thirty one year old male. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in 2009. I was in college at the time commuting to campus and I would suddenly keep getting very dizzy on the interstate. I wouldn't be able to get a good breath, my heart would start pounding, and I'd have to pull over. For all I know now medically at this point in time, I'd have said it was anxiety, but there was no real context for anxiety, and things only got crazier from there.\n\nHigh blood pressure was the diagnosis they came up with at the time, and they slapped me with some prescriptions and sent me out the door. Unfortunately, after a couple of different medications, I began getting palpitations and low pulse. Eventually, they put me in the hospital for three days. While there, they ran a few tests. My blood pressure kept climbing and they kept giving me nitro sending it plummeting. It got very dangerously low at one point and the male nurse was scared to death. He said he thought he was going to lose me. He took the time to pray with me that night before he left his shift. All the nurses would run in everytime I got up to pee. They said my pulse would spike from a resting rate in the 70s to 140 or so just from standing up and walking to the restroom. I had a stress test and echo done, but everything seemed fine. They eventually sent me out with a 24 hour halter monitor.\n\nFast forward a few months and I am constantly in and out of the hospital with chest pain and palpitations. I had my blood pressure medicine changed several times. Had more tests ran on my heart. All the focus was entirely on it, although I still struggled greatly with dizziness and breathing difficulties. I went to one heart doctor who told me I needed a pace maker. That scared me. There didn't seem to be a real basis for such an extreme thing that I could understand but he had a really thick accent that I couldn't quite follow all of the time. I ended up going to a different heart doctor who put me on a 30 day event monitor and said the other guy must've been crazy because I was fine.\n\nI dealt with these symptoms on a daily repeat from 2009 to 2013... dizziness while driving, difficulty breathing, constantly fatigued, waking from sleep not breathing, chest pains that came on and had all the symptoms of a heart attack, dangerously high blood pressure, ridiculously low pulse, palpitations, even some strange situations with my eyes twitching and blurring and having black spots obstruct my vision. I went to sleep so many times at night wondering if I would see the next day. I was literally too scared to function, afraid to die.\n\nI don't know what I did different if anything at all, but I had a healthy spell from late 2013 maybe (I can't be too sure when it stopped) all the way through February 2016. Oddly enough, some of those times there were the most stressful times of my life (lost our house in a storm while my wife was pregnant, had a law suit try to tear me down, got laid off by my company, etc.) but my health held up. I took it for granted barely even noticing as I'd just gotten used to it being such an occurrence. I wish I would've celebrated and held on to that feeling longer, because in February of last year, it came back stronger than ever before. I had what I thought was a heart attack at work. Came out of nowhere. I got really weak and dizzy, began to shake, my chest clenched up , I lost all breath, and my arms went numb. I blacked out in the floor for a couple of seconds before being rushed to the hospital. I've not had an easy day since then.\n\nMy chest stays hurting. I've had so many doctors look at me and tests done. I can't breath well (had an 81 on a spirometry test at the ashthma doc). I wake up nightly feeling like I stopped breathing and/or having my heart jump with a feeling of electrical shock. My pulse has been very weak sometimes dropping to the mid 30's and when it gets to that, I feel I'm for sure going to die. I'm not on any beta blockers, but I am on Losartan Potassium and Amlodopine Besylate as well as a number of other things. They tried me on anxiety medicine, it never worked for me, only made things worse.\n\nThis time, a slew of things have been found... I have Alpha One Antitrypsin Deficiency. I have ulcers in my stomach. I have low breathing function. Just found out I have sleep apnea. I have an extra rhythym in my heart on occassion and mild mitral valve prolapse. I have a complex benign cyst in my kidney. Most of all concerning to me, I have 5 times the maximum suggested amount of renin in my body. I have also been having my face get dry and red (apparently a case of Seborrheic Dermatitis). I've noticed this tends to precede the worst cases of my symptoms.\n\nStill, I suffer daily and no one claims to know what exactly is going on. My blood pressure continues to stay high with the Diastolic number often being in the low 100's. My pulse continues to plummet at night. My eyes will twitch and blur. My heart will skip beats. I will get dizzy driving or playing a game or watching a movie in the theater. My arms and legs will get numb and tingly at times. I belch way too often. I wake up from mid sleep with shocks and gasps. I will bear a constant pressure and pain in my chest day in and day out.\n\nEvery doctor I have just refers me to another specialist or prescribes something new. I've been left to research this mostly on my own, because I am losing hope. Here are my theories. Snoring is a tell-tell sign of sleep apnea, yet I never snore, therefore this makes me think it may be Central Sleep Apnea caused by my brain not telling my lungs to pull in air. Seborrheic Dermatitis is also sometimes caused by diseases of the Central Nervous System. Perhaps something is going on with my nerves that are causing my body to have all kinds of issues? Could it be MS? Maybe some other CNS Disease?\n\nMy other theory is that there has to be a reason for my renin to be at 262.5 when the maximum is supposed to be 50 at the highest. I feel that it has to do with the complex cyst they found in my kidney, but I can’t get a doctor to actually agree to talk about removal. Renin is generally produced by the kidneys when blood pressure is low… but mine is never low. Why is there so much Renin? Could Renin be causing my blood pressure to stay skyrocketed? Could that in turn be causing other parts of my body to not function as well?\n\nI need a way through this. I’m without hope, afraid, and depressed. I have been ravaged by medical debt and my marriage is full of tension and disappointment. I can’t play with my doctor, can’t go for a walk, can’t go on a date, can’t even have sex without tons of pain and hurt. My wife wants another child, but I don’t know if I’d survive any of it. This has halted my life drastically. I can’t even get surprised or excited without having tons of pain follow suit. It’s like I get very flushed and dizzy and weak and then my heart and blood pressure go crazy. If anyone has any answers, any suggestions, anything at all… please help me. I am desperate.","like_count":"0","tags":["High Blood Pressure","Heart Attack","Heart Disease"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Please Help Me Solve My 8 Year Medical Mystery","resp_content":"The opinions expressed in WebMD Message Boards are solely those of the User, who may or may not have medical or scientific training.

I have been to the ER two times in one day. Almost came back the next day but gave up on the idea due to the lack of help they tend to be in my situation. But I have been fearful, and I wish it was something I could combat, but I don't see how I'm going to pull through this.\n\nThe first night, I went to the ER around 2AM. My pulse kept dropping down into the mid 30's, and I felt absolutely horrid. It was the second night in a row, and this time I just got fed up with it. I felt weak, cold, and like I had already passed out several times by the time I got a ride over there. They did some cardiac workup, kept me just a little while, and told me to go on home and follow up with my electrophysiologist. I practically begged them to admit me because I didn't want to go back home and deal with that low pulse while trying to sleep again. I am by no means an athlete of any sort, and my pulse should never be that low. In fact, my resting rate was always average (in the 60's). But anyways, I went back home around 7AM and I actually fell asleep pretty quick (from the exhaustion of the last couple of nights probably). Unfortunately, things took a turn at around 9:30AM when I suddenly woke up out of bed with the worst chest pain I ever felt. I could swear I was having a heart attack. It wasn't the first time I felt such things, but I still to this day don't know what else it could be. I feel the muscles, the heart, in my chest seize up and clench into itself, I feel a heat spread around it throughout the right side of my chest, into my left arm, down my stomach. My pulse picks up pace in an extreme measure. I get really light headed, my vision was literally skewed where I was seeing things in a way that it looked like they were coming in at an angle, and my blood pressure was insanely high. I began shaking pretty crazy... leg kicking, tremors in my arm, my body jerking like I'm freezing, teeth chattering while I try to talk and get someone to help. I took a spray of nitro, and went back to the ER. Full cardiac workup, EKG, CT Scan, chest x-ray... I've been through all of it before. Another 24 hour halter monitor. It was a longer wait this time, but they sent me home again... follow up with your electrophysiologist.\n\nI call my electrophysiologist. They can't see me today. In fact, he's pretty booked up for the next couple of months. They'll follow up with me soon.\n\nI go home, I actually manage to get a nap for once. My pulse didn't drop below the 50's. I napped a good chunk of the evening. I took a sleeping pill before bed and slept great surprisingly. The next day, the halter monitor stopped at around 7AM. I unplugged it all as it was no longer recording. All is well until shortly after lunch. Suddenly, something else... I feel a weird bubble like feeling under the left part of my chest. Thought maybe it was just gas, but as I felt it, I also felt dizzy and light headed. I get out my blood pressure machine and it is recording an irregular heartbeat. I get out my stethoscope and listen. Sure enough, everytime I feel that bubble feeling (although it is below where my heart should be), there is an extra beat... kind of like a thud... and it's not at all in rhythm with the rest of it. My heart would have it's regular beat and then almost every other time, there would be that extra thud, and sometimes that extra thud would happen twice before the second set of heart beats. There was no method to it really. But it made me uneasy, as I was getting really dizzy and woozy during it. I called the electrophysiologist again. They were all in a meeting. Someone would call me back. After about 30 minutes, it went away. I was very glad. Still felt rough though. Electrophysiologist never called back. Then around 5:30 or so in the afternoon, it came back again, this time more frequent. It did it for over 2 hours. I wished dearly that that halter monitor was still recording. I had to go to the hospital to return the halter monitor anyway, so I got a ride there and returned it and I sat in that waiting room for a couple of more hours and waited for it to stop fighting the urge to just go back there again and let them run things on me again... and let them send me home again feeling helpless and alone. Damn this medical system. I have never felt so helpless in my life...\n\nI went to sleep last night. My pulse dropped down around 32 at one point. I closed my eyes, I shivered, I shook, I fought to stay positive and stay sane mostly. I would jerk awake numerous times in the middle of the night as if my heart was shocking itself back in rhythm. I slept in sporadic chunks. And here I am again wondering what I can do, where I can go, how I can fix this... 3 fairly different symptoms (bradycardia, major chest pains, very irregular heartbeat) all in the span of a couple of days, all heart related, but I have been through that ringer and no one ever finds anything wrong. They always want to throw age in as a factor of disbelief (oh, you're too young for anything like that to be wrong, you shouldn't worry about those things, are you sure you're not imagining it?).\n\nI am very tired.

Consider cardioversion (externally shocking the heart back into normal sinus rhythm, which may/can fail). Control the ventricular response.

When too much fluid collects in the legs, the swelling can stretch the skin and cause pain, scarring, and sometimes even skin breakdown. Along with taking the diuretic medicine to remove the extra fluid and decreasing the amount of salty foods he is eating, here are a few thoughts as you work with his doctor to help him feel better.\n\nSwelling in the legs can definitely come from congestive heart failure (when your heart does not pump blood forward properly, it can back up into your legs). But other things to consider are:\n\n1) sitting or staying in one position too long (when the muscles in your legs move it actually helps to pump the blood back up to the heart), so he may want to try to elevate his legs while sitting and then get up and walk or flex his calf muscles every 30 minutes,\n\n2) eating too much salty food, so you may want to replace any of that kind of food with healthy snacks,\n\n3) certain medications can also cause swelling (like anti-inflammatory medicines that he may be taking for back pain—ibuprofen and naproxen are in this category, called NSAIDS), so you want to talk to his doctor about his medication list.\n\nBesides these thoughts, massage can also help: try stroking up the legs with firm (but not painful pressure). You can also talk to his doctor about compression stockings.

I had not had my heart checked again from that point and did not end up getting any surgery to close the VSD.\n\nMy irregular heartbeat and murmur stayed with me my whole life and I later developed asthma around the age of 10, the doctor at the time said that it was likely related to my heart condition.\n\nI have had a few episodes that have resulted with me in the hospital over my childhood-teen years that felt like massive heart pains and chest pains, but were always diagnosed as panic attacks.\n\nI am now 24 and I do feel like my heart doesn't work the same as people around me, I tend to have a high resting heart rate (90-100 bpm), my blood-pressure is usually average and I have asthma attacks when I exert myself (high intensity sports, sexual activity, etc.).

Last year I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and put on 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Starting about 6 weeks ago my blood pressure and heart rate started spiking causing me to get dizzy, have headaches, and feel a burning in my chest, like my heart was struggling to pump blood to my body. I've been to the ER 5 times since then and every time EKG's are normal, blood is normal, and I've had one X-Ray with nothing wrong. My PCP didn't want to listen to me and said I have anxiety and put me on citalopram which made my symptoms ten times worse so I stopped taking them after 5 days. I've been put on propranolol and it's actually helped with my headaches and keep my heart rate and blood pressure under control, but I've been feeling very fatigued and weak and if I leave the house and go to the store I get dizzy and feel like I'm going to fall down, which is how I was feeling before the propranolol. At this point I feel like all I can do is lay down and feel awful. I've had poor dental health most of my life and have had quite a few untreated tooth abscesses, could I have endocarditis? I asked the RN and DR at the ER and they said it would've shown up on the EKG and it didn't. I get a sensation in my chest that feels like my heart or something by my heart is swollen and protruding from my chest, like there's a patch or something under my shirt on my skin. I've also had pain in my left shoulder, neck, back and arm the last few days. Sometime's It's felt like I have a lump or food in my throat. I have an appointment with a cardiologist in a week, I'm going to ask for and echo and/or angiogram just to be sure. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind if nothing shows up at the cardiologist, has anyone heard of or been in a similar situation?

I've been getting them ever since about age 3, and have developed ways to prevent them. However, I would like to learn more about them and why they happen. So far doctors have not been able to figure out exactly what it is. Maybe someone on here can help? Here's how they go down:\n\nI'll get a stomach ache or headache. It won't go away or get better no matter what I do. Eventually, I sort of zone out for a few seconds and come back realizing something is wrong. Everything becomes blurry like my life is running at 3 frames per second, and my thinking isn't very clear. At this point I know I'm about to have a seizure (it's my aura I guess you could say). This happens for about 10-30 seconds, then I faint. I wake up and it's like in a movie, I hear people saying my name (in echoes), there's ringing in my ears, vision is blurry, and my eyes are sensitive to light. Then, I just throw up. Repeatedly. There hasn't been any magic fix, just time and sleep. Usually it takes about a week to fully recover from these episodes. Sometimes I get multiple episodes in a day (Max I've had is 3-4 in a few hours). I don't shake or anything, and I wasn't sure it was a seizure until it happened once in front of some doctors. They said it was definitely a seizure. In the ambulance once, just from throwing up (no episode) they said my heart skipped 3-4 beats. That can't be good.\n\nSo far what I've found out causes this is food dyes, (Red 40, Blue 30, etc), and stress (bleeding and stuff). Maybe it's just an anxiety reaction? Possibly the food dyes make me sick and I panic. I haven't had one in a while, now that I've avoided some of these causes. Still, sometimes I stay home because I have a certain type of stomach or headache, and it is a bit of a burden in life.\n\nSorry for the wall of text.

But I would add your HDl is so hi because you work out every day. That's important because these are the lipoproteins that will help \"sweep\" away the LDL. My cardiologist once told me he treated a patient for years that was a marathon runner and his HDL levels were high like yours. But when he had a knee injury and was no longer as active, his HDL decreased significantly. Your LDL, depending on the lab's determination of what is too high, is actually higher than borderline. The average lab says your LDL should be below 130. I suggest you have a frank conversation and be completely honest with your Dr. You're young and can still get this under control very easily. Do you have a family history of heart disease or family history of cholesterol issues? What you failed to mention is your triglyceride levels. I suspect if your LDL is high your triglycerides are also. These are all things your Dr will take into consideration if they decide to put you on any meds. All that said, your LDL isn't anything outrageous. You Dr may even suggest fish oil supplements, but don't go out and buy just any supplement. Your Dr will probably have a brand preference. If you do go on any meds, a very low dose statin will probably get that number down in about a month.\n\nI'll be 52 in 5 days.

Wich all makes sense since two years later I had another heart attack but luckily it was able to be fixed in about 15 minutes with angioplasty and a stent. So I started asking my family questions.

Would this also mean that my BP is low/normal if the medicine brings my pulse down to 60?\"\n\nNot 100% guaranteed but hopefully yes. :)\n\nNormal resting heart/pulse rate in adults is 60-100 beats per minute (BPM). Average resting heart/pulse rate in men is 72-78 BPM and in women is 78-84 BPM.\n\nBeta-blockers lowers the heart rate and blood pressure by design.\n\nAbout Blood Pressure (BP)\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep BP within acceptable limits, but sometimes, changes in lifestyle, or health (stress factors, anxiety, etc.), make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\n>Compensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nAdditionally, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A consistently narrow (say 20-25 or less) or consistently wide (say 60-65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

This can allow for a daily prophylactic aspirin, or for patients with rheumatologic conditions to regularly take aspirin or other NSAIDs.\n\nThis procedure involves starting with a low dose of the NSAID and progressively giving larger doses over time. It should be done under the supervision of a physician experienced in this procedure.\n\n***Patients who need cardiovascular prevention who cannot be desensitized to aspirin may be candidates for therapy with the non-NSAID clopidogrel (Plavix). It, too, inhibits platelet activity and is sometimes used with aspirin.\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is not an NSAID. It is usually well tolerated by those with a history of NSAID reactions. Acetaminophen can be used for fever control and treatments of some types of pain. It is not useful in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"he scoped him and wants to put a stent in\"\n\nNoteworthy, after a drug-eluting stent (DES) is implanted, it is typically 1 year of Plavix use, though researchers say that continuing studies will prove or disprove a universal benefit beyond that. With the older bare-metal stents that are still being used, it is typically 1 month of Plavix.\n\n***Aspirin (at a dose that ones' cardiologist suggests) is sometimes added to the Plavix regimen, though it has a different mechanism of action, and can increase the risk of bleeding. Aspirin-alone may be applicable in some cases, and usually continues indefinitely after Plavix is stopped.\n\nAbout Plavix\n\nPlavix prevents platelets (a component of blood) from clumping together and causing a blood clot (thrombosis).\n\nPlatelets (thrombocytes), manufactured in the bone marrow, are small cells in the bloodstream that are part of the blood clotting process.\n\nPlavix 'n Stents\n\nPlavix-therapy is extremely important. As reported, early or late-stent thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot on the struts of a DES, occurring weeks, months, or even years, after implantation, which according to one study, leads to death about half the time.\n\nDES delays a process known as endothelialization, in which a thin layer of cells gradually grows over and covers over the stent.\n\nA study published in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, detailed 4 cases in which DES patients experienced a heart attack from stent thrombosis about a year after implantation, and shortly after stopping antiplatelet-therapy.\n\nStudies have revealed that an increased potential for blood clot problems may continue on in some DES patients much longer than previously understood/realized, thus many interventional cardiologists are recommending Plavix for a year (or more), some indefinitely/for life, especially is one has had a heart attack or brain attack (stroke).\n\nBottom line\n\nCoronary stents are just a Band-aid or spot treatment, as this does not address the underlying disease process and what drives the progression.\n\nMost important, coronary artery disease (CAD) is a life-long unpredictable (which can exhibit periods of stabilization, acceleration and even some regression) condition, requiring a continuum of care.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD community (since 8/99)\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/8853/aspirin-allergy"},{"post":{"author":"amh123","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Frank's Sign?","post_content":"How do I tell if a ear lobe wrinkle is \"Frank's Sign\" and if so, how significant is it.

The cardiologist states that he won't sign off on it because of the FDA warning so I went to a psychiatrist who won't write it without cardiologist approval (although he initially agreed there is little risk). I seriously cannot function without this medication and may not have a job for long without it. I am a few pounds overweight (BMI under 30), work a sedentary job, and could eat a little better, but I was generally healthy prior to this. I have no history of alcohol or drug abuse.

I was a non-smoker, rarely drank, ate healthy and my family history of heart disease is a generation removed. What I wish I had known were the symptoms of a heart attack in women. I knew the symptoms in men. It started around 10:30pm on a Tuesday night like a light switch was flipped. My body was freaking out. It started with horrible diarrhea and I had chest pressure (had it the weekend before but thought it was asthma symptoms reappearing due to the awfully oppressive heat we were having). I also felt what I thought was heartburn so I took some tums. I got in bed and soon after I had to run to the bathroom again. Then I began sweating - but it was as if someone threw water on me - I was DRIPPING sweat! I never sweat like that before. My clothes were drenched! I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know what (and a heart attack was the last thing on my mind). I do live with my parents, but I didn't want to wake them up since they babysit my niece and nephews and wake up early. I decided to take a very cold shower and I literally sat in the bathtub letting the cold water run on me, hoping it'd cool me down. It sorta did. Once I got back to my air-conditioned bedroom I started to get hot and cold sweats, so my poor dog would go between being too hot and then freezing because sometimes I had to turn the oscillating fan on too (in addition to the ac). Over the course of the night I had about 4 episodes of diarrhea, 3 episodes of throwing up, and I began getting a pain in my neck that traveled to between my shoulder blades. I barely slept, but as a (then) insomniac it wasn't anything new. By 6am I was exhausted and felt horrible. I called out sick and I went down to my parents - I couldn't even pick my 17 lb dog up! I asked my dad to feed and take my dog out & then I asked my mom to take me to the ER. I had to walk back up 3 flights to my bedroom to get changed (which was so difficult!!), and we went to the ER. Luckily no one was in there so I went right back and they began tests. It was the blood tests that showed I had troponin levels and after running it a 2nd time they decided to do a heart cath. I remember coming to afterwards and asked if they found a blockage. They told me they found a blockage but couldn't stent me. They said my left main (or widowmaker) was blocked 100% and I would need open heart surgery to get a bypass. I was shocked!! My mom literally nearly fainted - they had to quick shove a chair under her. I had emergency open heart surgery that night. It took 4 hours. Recovery has been long and difficult, and even now 5 months out I still have days where I'm hurting. But it could be worse, so I remind myself that on my bad days. It was discovered I have an auto immune disease (Sjogrens Syndrome) that most likely caused my heart attack due to the inflammation. So I'm on medication for that too. I've become involved with the American Heart Association as I want to advocate and share my story so that others are aware of the symptoms, to know their numbers and to keep up on their heart health. I do feel more awareness has to be out there for women heart health!! I've already made a difference in a few lives and I hope to help more. But bottom line - I wish I knew the symptoms because I was lucky. I should have never survived the night, but I did. And so I share my story to try and help others.\n"},{"author":"jessiebaker","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: \"What I Wish I Knew Before I Had A Heart Attack\" -- Share Your Stories and Advice","resp_content":"I'm 44 and had a mild heart attack according to my cardiologist who did my angiogram have a 4 year old son I wish I knew you could prevent and reverse heart disease through diet before all this but I am blessed to be here and count myself as such\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/3080/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-had-a-heart-attack----share-your-stories-and-advice"},{"post":{"author":"yettiman","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"The day I almost died","post_content":"I was 46 years old when I had my first heart attack.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nAdditionally, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A consistently narrow (say 20-25 or less) or consistently wide (say 60-65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

SVT can send the heart into speeds up to 150-200 BPM, and sometimes, even as high as 300 BPM.\n\n\"I've always been told that my condition is not life threatening.\"\n\nThough SVT itself typically does not damage the heart, is typically not serious or life-threatening in a structurally normal heart, some accompanying symptoms can surely make one feel/think otherwise.\n\nSymptoms that may/can occur with SVT includes chest pain/discomfort/pressure/tightness, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness/dizziness, and in uncommon to rare cases, syncope (temporary loss of consciousness, which includes passing out or fainting).\n\nAre brief spikes in diastolic blood pressure dangerous?\n\n\"But can brief high blood pressure be life threatening?\"\n\nAbout Blood Pressure (BP)\n\nThe complex human body is usually able to keep BP within acceptable limits, but sometimes, changes in lifestyle, or health, make this difficult. This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\n>>>High diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nAlso, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit.

Seven weeks ago, the cardiologist installed a defibrillator/pacemaker combination. That may bring the output up to 30-35%. Wait and see. It should be 55 minimum. I always felt fine. Still do. I have to pace myself now that I am 75. I mow the yard. Plant bushes and small trees in my yard. Use a shovel and hole digger, of course. Lift anything not over 50 lbs. or so. I can lift more.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nAlso, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A consistently narrow (say 20-25 or less) or consistently wide (say 60-65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals are drug-resistant/non-responders or exhibit poor response to certain cardiovascular meds or treatment(s).\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBe well-informed\n\nHigh Blood Pressure\n\nChoosing blood pressure medications\n\nChoosing the right high blood pressure medication can be tricky.

What the nutrition therapy instructions do not include is how many calories she should be taking in daily. After such an extreme trauma to her body I assume that her body needs the appropriate amount of caloric nutrition daily in addition to it being low in sodium to help heal itself from this damage.

In Oct of 2016 I had my very first panic attack but initially thought it was heart related. Had used chewing tobacco for the longest time and thought it was the end of me when I had a chest muscle twitch. I checked myself in to the ER a few days later and followed up with a cardiologist the following week and again 2 months later for a stress test. Took me 15 min to get my heart rate up to 164 BPM on the stress test treadmill. My blood pressure is always around 120-133 over 79-82. Also I should mention that I am an avid runner, marathoner, cross fitter, etc.. I was convinced, prior to the test, that I had some sort of underlying heart issue or my poor tobacco decision had ruined me health-wise. I aced the stress test in the cardiologist's eyes and I had ease of mind for about a month. BTW - I have no significant family history with heart disease. My grandfather had a heart attack at age 52 and was an avid smoker and my uncle survived a stroke around the age of 55.\n\nThen I started having some of the similar symptoms back when I had my anxiety/panic attack and I don't know what the heck is considered stress/anxiety symptoms, and what is considered a potential heart issue... Sometimes when I have too much caffeine I get hyper-sensitive to any involuntary movement my upper body makes.\n\nFor example, my jaw muscles get really tense like I had just been chewing on a bag of skittles or box of JuJy Fruits candy but I get no neck pain and eventually it goes away. I also grind my teeth at night so maybe the muscles are tightening from the caffeine?? Off the caffeine symptoms, I'll get a slight pain in the left side of by back like someone has their knuckle in my back muscle just to the left of my spine. It doesn't hurt to breathe, just annoying when I feel it.\n\nThe most annoying/questionable symptom I have is when my left arm begins to feel like someone is tugging on it. It doesn't hurt when I touch my forearm, shoulder, or any part of my arm. I sleep on my left side too with my arm under my wife's pillow the right of me, so if you can envision that..? Maybe my arm is just sore from my sleeping position all the time? I used to sleep on my right side before we moved to a new house and changed sides of the bed LOL! But never noticed pain in my right arm when I slept on my right side..\n\nWhen I get these symptoms I try and remember that I aced my stress test, I'm healthy and young, but for any of those that can relate.. it is hard to ignore the physical symptoms when they're constantly there! And to be honest, I'm mentally thinking \"Ok here it comes, here it is.. here it comes..\" about some sort of heart issue about 8 hours of the day.\n\nSo am I really insane?!? What else does someone want to hear, if anything, to get a better idea? Anyone else having the same issues/symptoms, or have explanations? Can stress really beat me up like this and have heart-like symptoms? I'm to the point now where I don't want to even eat any eggs or spicy foods because I'm afraid my cholesterol is high, even though blood work is perfect, and might stroke out! I mean..

As one who has struggled with both depression and anxiety, I can identify. Anxiety makes us anxious. You sound anxious to me. Interestingly, I recently read that anxiety causes skin outbreaks and depression causes stomach pain and digestive issues. I agree with these findings as I have found them to be true. Since you have shown diligence by having all the appropriate physical tests to rule out any physical problems, why not see your doctor and ask to try an anti-anxiety medication? Many people struggle with resistance to taking psychotropic medications because of social stigma. This is rediculous. If you had a broken arm, you would get a cast, wouldn't you? Men are notorious for this since they feel as if they are somehow weak if they can't control their emotions. But, your emotions are triggered by your thoughts. Try as hard as we may, we aren't always able to control our thoughts. I have been helped greatly by taking medication.

My husband had a trucking company for 50 years. He also chewed tobacco. I was never crazy about the habit and worried about him getting cancer in his mouth. But when you're on the freeways in California fighting our notorious traffic, it causes a lot of anxiety. I guess he thought it settled his nerves. I tried for years to get him to understand that nicotine is addictive and that as he began to need a \"nicotine fix\" that in itself was causing his anxiety, which was only relieved by chewing more tobacco. So when he retired, I started in on him again. He is now nicotine free! The way he withdrew was by substituting Mint Snuff for tobacco. This provided the oral fixation he had become addicted to, without the nicotine. Little by little, the frequency of using the mint has dwindled. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in trying, you can purchase it online at: mintsnuffsecure.com (sold by Oregon Mint Snuff) and possibly at your local liquor store.

It was determined I was having panic attacks and my PCP prescribed Zoloft and some years later, Xanax. I smoke 1/2 pack per day on average. Anyway, the technicians needed to get my heart rate to 139 in order to complete the test; I had stopped my atenolol 24 hours prior as they ordered.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher, lower than normal, spike up, then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP can be related to various heart disorders, and sometimes kidney, liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nHealth dangers from BP vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic, diastolic, or both, is elevated. Isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic BP appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic BP is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high BP from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases.\n\nAdditionally, pulse pressure is important, the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A consistently narrow (say 20-25 or less) or consistently wide (say 60-65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.\n\nALWAYS be proactive in your health care and treatment.

But how much speeding-up of your heart is safe when you exercise?\n\nYou need the answer to this question in order to maximize your exercise benefits while not overworking your heart. Your target heart rate isn't one rate but a range of rates (beats per minute, or bpm), expressed as percentages of your maximum heart rate, that are safe for you to reach during exercise. For most healthy people, the American Heart Association recommends an exercise target heart rate ranging from 50% to 75% of your maximum heart rate, which is normally calculated as the number 220 minus your age.\n\nwww.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4736 .\n\nAdditionally, beyond target heart rate (THR), and maximum heart rate (MHR), heart rate recovery (HRR) is also very important. HRR is how fast the heart rate returns to normal (for the individual) after vigorous exercise/physical activity, with the first minute being the most critical or telltale.\n\nThe H/P rate should gradually and smoothly return to normal within several minutes.

Her blood pressure was 160/98. They gave her a GI cocktail and hours later sent her home. The next day we were back in the ER, same scenario. 3 days later we went to the family doctor who gave us a BP log and told us to log it for a week and come back. We didn't make it but 2 days. Within that 2 days she passed out in the hall at school and when someone got her to the office her BP was at 155/108. I picked her up. Her symptoms were pale, shakey, & blurred vision. I took her immediately to her Dr who prescribed her Cozzar 50mg with a .01 Clonidine for emergency's only. That worked for 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks we were back in the ER from school where she passed out again and they admitted her into the hospital for evaluation for 3 days. After the 3 days they still had no idea why she was having the issues and sent her home again and still no answers. Finally we got into a pediatric cardiologist and he wondered why we were there, like he just didn't understand the problem, like it was just normal or something, no big deal, so he sent us to a pediatric neurologist who is treating her for migraines which by the way she doesn't even have. The headaches are real but they are only a problem when the BP is a problem. So we drive an hour away 2 times a week for nothing and another 2 times a week to be treated for migraines. No one is addressing the BP at all. Now all the sudden, the blood pressure is low all the time, like most of the time. Yesterday the school called and I had to pick her up with a BP of 80/62 and she was pale and shakey and couldn't barely stand up. She slept all evening. Then today, they called me and I had to go get her with a BP of 155/111... It doesn't make sense to me. How does a 16 year old girl have hypo and hypertension and how do you treat that? There has to be a cause. That can't be normal. It has to be causing damage to her somewhere down the line. It can't be healthy. No one is doing anything to figure out what the problem is and I know there has to be a reason. I live in Louisiana and there aren't a lot of options here. I've thought of out of state help but idk if our insurance with cover out of state. I know medicaid won't but idk about TriCare. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm stressed and worried. Scared for what's gonna happen to her and no one is helping us. Anything you can tell me would be great. I need some ideas of what to do. Am I freaking out for nothing? Any ideas are appreciated! I will go anywhere I need to go , climb any mountain, cross any ocean, call anyone I need to or drive any amount of miles needed to get her the care she needs.

So I just had a child almost 4 months ago it's my second I'm 25 in okay health never had anything serious and don't have anything in my family. I've smoked for a lot of years over ten but I'm in the process of quitting cold turkey now. So this all started when I was pregnant about 4 months and I started having heart palpitations, told my gynecologist and they send me to the cardiologist to have an echo, and ultrasound and I also wore a monitor for a day. They said they could find nothing so I let it go. The only other thing I mentioned to my doctor was that I had bad neck pain and she just told me to go get a massage. Fast forward to about a month after having my daughter. Pregnancy went good no problems so did the first month. Then I started having post partume depression I couldn't get out of bed didn't want to do anything and didn't feel good at all. Started feeling chest pressure and shortness of breath let it go for awhile and then finally went to the er one night because I was feeling really bad. They did an EKG and a few blood tests and sent me home. Then I called my doctor and set up an appointment and told her I was having bad headaches and chest pain with shortness of breath and the headaches were causing me to talk slower and forget things. They set me up with a month ecg machine to record my incidents and an app with the eye doctor. Now from then until now which has been about a month I've went to the er twice because my chest was hurting so bad and I felt like I was going to pass out. Alls they did was ekg and blood tests and sent me home. Now I'm sitting here and lately I've been feeling horrible. Every time I exert myself my heart races and my left arm hurts. The left side of my neck has still not stoppped hurting since I went to the doctors months ago. I get shortness of breath and feel like I'm gonna pass out when I exert myself my left arm hurts and so does the bottom left side of my back. I've also been getting pretty bad headaches with brain fog. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm so miserable all the time I don't want to do anything it's effecting everything and I can't take it anymore I'm in pain all day every day and the doctors just don't seem to be taking it seriously.

SVT can send the heart into speeds up to 150-200 BPM, and sometimes, even as high as 300 BPM. Yikes right.\n\nParoxsymal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) typically causes a frightening burst/surge in heart/pulse rate that begins/starts and ends/stops suddenly (hence the term paroxsymal), which can last for just mere seconds or it can continue on for minutes to hours to days.\n\nSVT/PSVT typically does not damage the heart, is typically not serious or life-threatening in a structurally normal heart, though some symptoms that may/can occur can surely make one feel/think otherwise.\n\nSymptoms that may/can occur with SVT, PSVT includes chest pain/discomfort/pressure/tightness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness/dizziness, and in uncommon to rare cases, syncope (temporary loss of consciousness, which includes passing out or fainting). Sometimes there can be no symptoms at all.\n\nCertain drugs may/can control/suppress a fast (tachy) or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Of course, prescription drugs, in some cases, may/can the cause the condtion to worsen or cause new symptoms as side effects.\n\nBeyond drugs and ONLY WHEN DEEMED APPLICABLE to the patient, as an extreme treatment, a catheter ablation can be performed by a hightly-skilled cardiologist/electrophysiologist.\n\nThe overall results/success rates appear to be vastly improved over some years ago, especially with continuing improvements made in older standard radiofrequency energy (heat-based) technology, as well as newer technology such as cryoenergy/freezing, and high-intensity focused ultrasound.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums DOES NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n\nWebMD DOES NOT endorse any specific product, service or treatment.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/5358/will-my-svts-go-away-need-opinions"},{"post":{"author":"funcrew","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"How to find my catheter ablation records from 1999?","post_content":"Seemingly a lifetime ago, I had a catheter ablation done to correct atrial tachycardia.

Common arterial (accustomed to high pressure and are more resistant to atherosclerosis) grafts are internal mammary or thoracic arteries (in the chest, most common is the left as opposed to the right, sometimes both can be used) and radial arteries (in the arm). Uncommon graft conduits include the right gastroepiploic artery, the inferior epigastric artery and the subscapular artery.\n\nSaphenous vein graft (SVG) failure after bypass surgery may be a high as 5%-10% in the first post-operative week. Disruption of graft endothelium correlates with early graft failure. The cardiothoracic surgeon should take measures during the surgery to avoid endothelial injury to the vein graft.\n\nSymptoms of a failed or collapsed bypass graft, include that of a blocked native coronary artery, which can include (when there is no, or insufficient collaterals, backup or rescue vessels) heart attack, myocardial infarction (MI, actual death or necrosis of heart muscle), which in turn can gradually, or quickly/suddenly (acutely) lead to heart failure/congestive heart failure, and sometimes sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n\nIf/when common procedures, first time or re-do, such as bypass or angioplasty, with or without stents, are not deemed feasible, there may/can be other options that includes non-invasive EECP, laser-based TMR or PMR/PMC, and gene therapy/transfer.\n\n\"He found that the stent he originally placed had been crushed down to a tapered shape by the surgeon.

It doesn’t cause pain, but you can feel an odd discomfort in your chest.\n\nThis happens when the electrical current that paces your heart is reversed, so the chambers of the heart are activated in the wrong sequence. In other words, the lower heart chambers pump first and they do so against closed valves causing blood to be pushed backward. ‘Pounding’ and ‘flurries’ in your chest are some words used to describe these events.\n\nYou also mentioned that you have a defibrillator and these devices can also cause this to happen when activated to correct a rhythm disturbance.\n\nMy advice for now is to monitor your heart rate.

On January 3rd, 2017 I went to a clinic to have an ECG. I felt some of my symptoms might be those of a heart attack. On occasion, I felt fatigue and tiredness. I also had a sensation in my left shoulder and left leg. I did not have pain or discomfort, it just felt like a tingle. Sometimes when I was at work (teacher) I would have trouble speaking and felt out of breath when I spoke. I would have to stop speaking and take a deep breath. Sometimes I had difficulty focusing on anything, like watching a movie or when driving. Often times I had to look away and look back, but I could not focus for long periods of time. So I decided to go to the doctor.All of these issues would come and go.\n\nAfter my ECG and blood test, my doctor told me my heart was fine, but my blood pressure was very high (150/100). I did not have diabetes and my kidneys were fine. He prescribed me Valianz and said I would need to take this for the rest of my life. Blood tests revealed I my cholesterol and triglycerides was high. I took Lipitor and another medication for 30 days only.\n\nI changed my lifestyle, started going to a gym and cutting out fast food and carbs. I was going to gym for about a month and I hurt my back because I was overdoing it. I have not been in the gym for the month of February. Currently, I am only taking Valianz for medication and I maintain a low carb high protein diet. Lean meat mostly and only fast food on a few occasions. However, some of the old symptoms have returned. Like the sensation on my left side. The sensation goes away when I am not laying down.\n\nIn the past, I had sleep apnea and used a cpap machine. I stopped using it because I had lost a lot of weight but since I had been snoring a lot and not sleeping well I started using it. Now sometimes I feel like I have shortness of breath. I had some discomfort in my chest area but it is not pain or pressure. This had just started the past Wednesday night and I missed work Thursday and Friday to rest and consider going to the doctor. I also wanted to get some rest and sleep.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, should I be worried? Also, if my heart is fine or should I be considering other possibilities? Is it possible for my heart to be fine in January and not fine now?

This is because vessel narrowing, caused by atherosclerosis, TAKES MANY YEARS to develop.\n\nHowever, the process of atherosclerosis begins in childhood. For most children, atherosclerosis is mild and progresses slowly. IN SOME CHILDREN, atherosclerosis WORSENS RAPIDLY, increasing the risk of heart disease, and less commonly, stroke in EARLY ADULT LIFE.\n\n\"Did the overdose cause the heart problems or was he born with or did he have heart problems?\"\n\nBoth hydrocodone and oxycodone are effective at easing acute and chronic pain. They both cause very similar side effects.

Normal resting range LVEF is 50%/55%-70%/75%. Under 50% enters into the realm of dysfunctional territory that goes from\nmild to moderate to severe.\n\nLVEF can vary from one type of diagnostic imaging modality to another, such as non-invasive echocardiogram, MUGA/ERNA, gated-SPECT with Cardiolite or Myoview, Cardiac PET, Cardiac MRI, and invasive angiogram (heart catheterization).\n\nAs applicable, some individuals who have a low (moderate) or a really low (severe) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) feel fine and function well, while others do not.\n\nAs applicable, in some cases, along with a doctor recommended/authorized exercise regimen (unless contraindicated), LVEF can be increased, sometimes substantially, by customizing/tweaking prescription drug-therapy (e.g., Coreg, which showed, back in its clinical trial days, that it could boost LVEF in some individuals) and supplemental (complimentary or integrative medicine) therapy, as deemed applicable.\n\nJust one example of complimentary medicine is the use of the supplement Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 or ubiquinone, a vitamin-like substance) for heart failure (though currently not scientifically proven, some doctors may advise the patient to give it a try) which may/can (i.e., along with doctor directed prescription drug-therapy, and with the doctor knowing about any supplements being taken) help to improve LVEF in some, with other supplements sometimes added to the mix as needed.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBe well-informed\n\nCleveland Clinic\n\nUnderstanding Your Ejection Fraction\n\nhttp://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/heartfailure/ejectionfraction.aspx\n\nWebMD/Cleveland Clinic\n\nHeart Failure: Living with Heart Failure\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/living-with-heart-failure\n\nClassifications of Heart Failure\n\nhttp://www.heartfailurecenter.com/hfcheartfailureclassifications.shtm\n\n.\n\nWebMD/WebMD forums does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"},{"author":"danijo47","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"My husband has been having many problems and today I found that he has all the symptoms of CHF.

Of course, I did not know anything was amiss so I kept with my routines, eating in restaurants, running, biking, swimming, not getting enough sleep, oh yeah, and working 10 hr days.

I'm about 100 pounds overweight so right there I know there are issues. I have the start of pre-diabetes as well. Plus a back injury from a car accident over a year ago I'm currently going to physical therapy for as it's created a sciatic issue. Now that you know that part of it, here is my issue.\nEven being WAY overweight I've never had a blood pressure issue. Even at 120lbs my heart rate was resting in the 100-120 range. They could never tell me why. That hasn't changed. Other than having slighly high sugar, a full blood panel last month came back normal. I'm now back to exercising daily and eating well. I've lost 20 pounds in about a month. It's coming off very slowly, but I want to do it the right way and keep it off. (I gained 120lbs in 3 years) I'm watching sugar and salt as well as the bad fats. It's just a lifestyle change, nothing out of the ordinary. I don't count calories or cut out any foods. I'm just making smarter choices on what I put into my body. Anyway, my blood pressure suddenly is off the chart (for me). When I go out with my kids or go shopping I can always tell because I get stabbing headaches and tingling and numbness on the left side of my face. I don't know if that is a symptom or not. But it always goes hand in hand with my blood pressure going into the 150-160/100-110 range. At first I thought it was back pain causing it. But now with all the exercise that pain is dying down. Then I thought maybe it was blood sugar, but I've tracked it cafefully and it is pretty normal at this point. But the head keeps getting worse and nothing takes care of it. My husband almost took me into the ER this past weekend for it. I was miserable, tired, dizzy, nauseous and had major head pain after spending the day with my family at a museum. (Walking WAY more than I should have.) I had put it off until today when I finally realized when my blood pressure spikes, I feel miserable. I know the lifestyle change is a no-option deal right now. I have to get the weight off and get healthy. But I can't be debilitated when my pressure goes up. Heck, I don't want it going that high, period. Until I get where I need to be, I need a temporary solution. I'm calling my doctor when they open again next week. But is there anything I can do for the meantime to try to lower it just enough so I feel well? I'll go on meds if the doctor wants me to, but I'm hoping someone might know of something to keep it slightly down until that point. Any help is appreciated.

It is a sudden sharp pinch inside the left part of my chest, (about halfway between the center of my chest and my left nipple), and I am unable to breathe normally without severe pinching/stabbing pain for around 20-40 minutes. Each time I breathe I have to inhale at about 30% of a normal full breath, if I breathe any deeper than that it pinches or pulls or whatever is going on and its extremely painful. One time I tried to lay down but couldn't because I found the stabbing pain would happen when I leaned over or to the side. All I can do is stand as still as possible and wait it out while forcing myself to breathe shallowly. I have figured out for sure that an episode will occur when I ingest a certain amount of caffeine so I have been able to lessen the occurrences by reducing caffeine intake- but I never consumed a lot of caffeine to begin with and the last time it happened I had drank only a half cup of coffee over an hour earlier (which should have been fine). The pain is in the same spot each time- never changes. I have also gotten very mild versions where I think to myself \"uh oh, I'm going to get a heart thing...\" but it never fully develops. I also have very mild pain that almost feels like soreness very frequently in the same vicinity, though its not as localized and specific as the extreme pinching pain episodes.

As reported, atrial fibrillation (which has various causes, associated with many cardiac conditons) is an independent risk factor for a brain attack/stroke (increasing the risk about 5-fold), and significantly increases all-cause mortality in most age groups.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals with AF are at an increased risk of heart failure or cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease) or a worsening thereof in those with pre-existing heart failure and/or cardiomyopathy.\n\nThere are a small % of individuals in which a reversible cause for AF can be readily identified, e.g., alcoholism, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes, and thus AF does not recur once the cause has been alleviated.\n\nGoals for managing those with AF are to restore and maintain the normal atrial rhythm and pumping function, control the ventricular rate, prevent any correlating major adverse coronary event (MACE).\n\nAF Management:\n\nCorrect any electrolyte imbalance/defficiency, in particular, potassium and magnesium.

I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.\n\nHowever, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.\n\nWhile we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.\n\nI do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD. I am hoping that this is something muscular related or even Costochondritis and not a major cardiovascular disease or an issue related to my heart murmur. If any of you might know what is causing this, I would appreciate your help.

Daily (60 count) after 2 1/2 month prior heart attack and triple bypass. I'm a 70 y/o woman, 5 foot, 4 inches height, & weigh 120. My heart surgeon & cardiologist are concerned about my low weight, and can't seem to gain even with good appetite. I have a history of non-seizure passing out spells lasting from minutes to a few hours. I've had testing for all types of seizure in 8 hospitals as inpatient & 2 outpatient. A cause has not been found. Cardiologist now thinks the heart attack might be cause, due to decreased blood flow. Yet I did pass out three days ago for first time since HA but says my very low BP (April 74/50) could still decrease blood flow. They couldn't get it to go up except when I was in severe pain; at one time spiked to 180/110, which went back down quickly after pain decreasing. I have history of severe Restless Leg Syndrome extending into feet, toes, arms & fingers, yet usually just at night & mostly controlled with Requip. I have had 4 back surgeries, & use fentanyl pain patch 100meq for chronic pain, & no other pain meds. I'm extremely careful to follow directions completely with this & other meds, even keeping a personal charting system for at home use with names, times meds given, along with vital signs & follow up affects, weekly weight, etc. I follow my heart diet very carefully, have never used tobacco products, no alcoholic usuage ever, & no type street drugs or abused prescriptions. Although small, I've never been overweight.\n& ate basically healthy even before my health problems. I've had 3 healthy pregnancies. Never really been sickly except for migraines & what I've already named. I have an older brother who had a Heart attack at age 30, shortly after a 5 year Air Force stay in Vietnam Nam. He was a heavy smoker until his first heart attack. He's had 3, then lived on a battery heart for over a year, then had a heart transplant after which he lived 13 years, & heart still good, but died from kidney failure. No heart problems from my mother's side, & my dad died at age 54 in 1964, from perforated ulcers which caused his stomach to burst. He had 6 surgeries in 5 months, & we didn't know it until we got autopsy report, but he was diabetic, which was I'm sure why his sutures never healed, & everything he ate, came directly out onto his chest from surgical site. His family died early on, before I was born, & we never knew anything about his family health issues. I also had 3 other siblings who died from cancer, 1 breast & lung, & 2 prostate ca, & skin ca. 2 were diabetic.\nI am considering getting a DNA to see what I can learn about possible family health & risk factors, esp since I now have 3 grandchildren, & 3 great grands.\nI saw my primary physician today for my monthly prescriptions. My heart team gave my primary dr full control of my medications after end of first month post HA & surgery. He prescribed the Fludrocort, but other than for decreased BP didn't explain. I read on it, & very concerned about the side effects & found nothing about its use that close to a major HA, & bypass surgery. I called the dr back just to be told that shortly he had been called out of town for a family emergency. I did call my cardiologist, but did not get a return call.\nI'm just concerned about about the risk factors before starting a med I'm not familiar with. I apologize this has been so long, but wasn't sure what was important & not.\nThank you so very much. I frequently read from Web MD, but this is the first time I've had questions.

I am a 30 year old Asian male. I'm about 165cm and I weigh about 49.8 kg. I have been a professional copywriter for the past 7 years and for more than a year now, I've been experiencing spells of breathing problems, palpitations and chest pains. There have also been several occasions wherein I felt as though my back would heat up whenever I lie down to sleep.\nVices: I don't drink but I do smoke. And because of my work, I foolishly got into the habit of smoking a lot because it helped me concentrate. I would consider myself a heavy smoker for the past 7 years. I used to smoke about 25 sticks per day but now I'm down to 15. And towards the end of 2015, I was also drinking a lot of coffee.\nMy health problems started on November 2015, a couple of months after I started working from home. I woke up feeling as though I'm not breathing right. I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not getting enough air. I do have a pulse oximeter and my measurements are normally at somewhere between 95 to 99. But on that day, it almost felt like my lungs were struggling, like there was a thin layer covering the insides of my lungs (if that makes any sense.) No phlegm though. Towards the end of the day, I started palpitating so I went to the doctor and have my self checked.\nI underwent ECG and the only thing the doctor could find was a right bundle branch block. So, she insisted that I go for a pulmonary function test and a chest x-ray. Both of which showed nothing.\nMeanwhile, my condition continued to worsen due to sporadic chest pains. The pain would often affect random parts of my chest and upper back and they'd normally feel like they're coming from a bone or the spaces between bones (or at least that's what they felt like.)\nSo, my doctor suggested that I go for a 2d echo exam. That too yielded no results so my doctor suggested that my issue might be psychological. I'd love to think that it is. I want to agree with her but after a couple of months of my condition failing to improve, I decided to see another doctor. This one deemed the same thing though he did perscribe me to start taking Coralan for my palpitations. He gave me the smallest dosage available and ordered me to take it twice a day so long as my heart rate isn't anywhere below 60 per minute. Eventually, he reduced it to only once a day. However, my condition remains vastly unchanged. I also took a blood exam but the only problem they found was that my uric acid was too high. I took meds for that already.\nThese days, I really feel as though I'm out of breath. I'd feel out of breath whenever I walk my dog or whenever I climb up the stairs. There was also this one frightening occasion wherein I tried to jog and after a while, my sternum started hurting whenever I took deep breaths. But that only happened once.\nCould I simply be out of shape? I work from home now so I no longer have to walk 20 minutes a day for work. I try to walk every now and then but it hasn't been a regular habit. Could this simply be a side effect of my smoking? I smoke a lot less now but I still do because I find it extremely hard to concentrate while working. Or could this simply be--as my doctors said--all in my head?\nI'm writing this not expecting for a solid answer but I do hope you guys could point me toward the right direction.

I went back to the doc 2 weeks later for the same exact feelings and recorded BP around the same reading. I was given an EKG test, blood work, and a 24hr holter monitor. All of the tests came back normal, blood work was excellent. The week after I ended up in urgent care and then the emergency room for feeling the same way but I recorded a BP measure of 164/94. All of the tests came back normal as well, EKG and blood work including a chest x-ray. I did have 2 low readings in the past month which were 142/78 and a 138/76 in the ER.

This may/can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.\n\nAlso, and as applicable, individuals over 60 years of age have a possibility of low oxygen (hypoxemia) during their stay over 6500', which may/can result in adverse events should one have pre-existing cardiac (heart) lung (pulmonary), or vascular/circulatory problems/disease.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nQuote!\n\n\"Be a questioning patient.

I underwent two tests- a 24 hr Holter monitor that came back normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram which came back totally normal except for the Grade I PAVM).\n\nKnowing that I have this makes me rather anxious, though my cardiologist and primary care physician said its really nothing to worry about.

I've had good heart health for my entire life (at least as far as I know- I'm able to do strenuous aerobic exercise, for example).\n\nI was also wondering what the opinion is (if any exits) regarding the safety of using alcohol and cannabis while having a PAVM. The cold medicine I took that resulted in arrhythmia is a vasoconstrictor, whereas cannabis is a vasodilator that lowers blood pressure (my blood pressure is around 107/65 mmHg). There is one time I recall feeling my heart race after smoking cannabis, but I don't know if that was anxiety or the drug.

I have a very active lifestyle, which includes weekly cycling or hiking and daily 30-60 min exercise consisting of aerobic and strength training. My diet is very low fat vegetarian and nearly vegan (very occasional cheese or egg as a “treat”). Despite my good diet, my cholesterol is a little over 230, so I am one of those unlucky people with naturally high cholesterol. According to my cardiologist if I hadn’t been following my current diet since ~1987, I probably wouldn’t be here to write this now.\n\nStarting last year I starting getting an intense pain in my chest along my sternum/esophagus during very intense exercise (i.e. hiking up a steep mountain, cycling up a big hill, etc). A key observation, I think, is that the pain goes away as soon as I stop or the mountain/hill becomes less steep. I also feel this symptom while climbing a few flights of stairs with a full stomach. The chest pain is often accompanied by moderate dizziness and disorientation and occasionally includes pain down my left arm. This last part led me to consult my cardiologist who immediately recommended I get a stress echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization, both of which showed no issues. Given a strong family history of GERD, which can also apparently cause chest pain, I was also referred to a gastroenterologist who recommended an upper endoscopy to look for damage to my esophagus; however, this test also showed no signs of a problem.\n\nI have now been diagnosed with “cardiac small vessel disease” since my main cardiac arteries are clear, but all that I have read indicates that this condition is not necessarily tied to exercise, but rather results in general fatigue, and is more common in women (of which I am not). I am now taking blood pressure, cholesterol lowering and stomach acid reduction med’s, but I am still symptomatic. I believe the key features of this syndrome are (1) chest pain during very intense exercise, (2) immediate relief of the pain when I moderate the intensity of the exercise and (3) the occurrence of similar symptoms climbing a flight of stairs with a full stomach.\n\nThanks for reading this - Any ideas or any others with similar issues?","like_count":"0","tags":["Heart Disease"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Angina, GERD or Other?","resp_content":"Hi there.

This can cause the BP to become consistently higher or lower than normal, or SPIKE up and then drop down.\n\nCompensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140 to 159 and diastolic of 90 to 99. Stage II is systolic of 160 to 179 and diastolic of 100 to 109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV is systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nNoteworthy, temporary increases or high SPIKES in BP, which was at one time was thought as being relatively harmless, can in fact be deleterious (may/can even cause a hypertensive brain attack) in some individuals, especially in those who already have hypertension or weakened arteries in the brain.\n\nHealth dangers from blood pressure vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic or diastolic pressure (or both) is elevated, and for how long.\n\nElevated blood pressure, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renovascular disease.\n\nPulse pressure is also important, which is the difference between systolic (heart's pumping phase) and diastolic (heart's resting phase). Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a little. A consistantly narrow (say 20 or 25 mmHg or less) or wide (say 60 or 65 or more) pulse pressure is not good.Hi:\n\n.\n\nWebMD Article\n\nSpikes in Blood Pressure Don't Always Need ER Care\n\nMost cases of \"hypertensive urgency\" can be treated safely in doctor's office, large study finds\n\nwww.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/news/20160613/spikes-in-blood-pressure-dont-always-need-er-care#1\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD Community Member (since 8/99)\n1\n"},{"author":"amateur22","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Hi, cardiostar, and thanks for the info.

Taking BP measurements when at rest/relaxed will help yield more consistent readings. If one has had a peaceful night's sleep, then measurements are best taken as soon as one awakes in the morning, as at this time of the day, the body will be at its lowest functioning levels, both physically and mentally, and therefore the factors that affect BP will be minimized. One should try to take the BP at the same time(s) every day.\n\nAs reported, compensatory mechanisms that control BP involves changing the diameter of veins and small arteries (arterioles), the amount of blood pumped out from the heart per minute (cardiac output), and the volume of blood in the vessels.\n\nHigh BP, temporary or chronic, may/can be related to various heart disorders, kidney problems, and sometimes liver, or adrenal gland problems. One's susceptibility to develop it can even be caused by an imbalance somewhere within the body's precise regulating systems.\n\nNormal resting BP in adults is under 120/80 with 115/75 or 110/70 considered as being optimal/ideal. Prehypertension is defined as systolic of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic of 80-89 mmHg. Stage 1 is systolic of 140-159 and diastolic of 90-99. Stage II is systolic of 160-179 and diastolic of 100-109. Stage III is systolic greater than 180 and diastolic greater than 110. Stage IV systolic of 210 and greater, and diastolic of 120 and greater.\n\nHealth dangers from blood pressure vary among different age groups and depending on whether systolic or diastolic pressure (or both) is elevated, and for how long.\n\nElevated blood pressure, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and diastolic/systolic hypertension, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renovascular disease.\n\nHigh systolic blood pressure appears as a significant indicator for heart complications, including death, in all ages, but especially in middle-aged and older adults.\n\nHigh diastolic pressure is a strong predictor of heart attack and brain attack in young adults and in those of any age with essential hypertension, high blood pressure from unknown causes, which occurs in the great majority of cases\n\nPulse pressure is also important, This is the difference between systolic and diastolic. Usually, the resting (in sitting position) pulse pressure in healthy individuals is 40 mmHg, give or take a bit. A wide or narrow pulse pressure is not good.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD Member (since 8/99)\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/402/quite-different-blood-pressure-readings"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Jamie","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Where Salt Is Hiding (and Why You Need to Find It)","post_content":"Salt is sneaky – it hides in lots of foods that don’t even taste salty.

In someone with significant heart disease, when the heart works hard, it does not get the blood supply and oxygen that it needs (a supply 'n demand mismatch).\n\nAt rest, however, the blood adequately reaches these areas or regions; ANTERIOR/ANTERO (front wall), INFERIOR/INFERO (lower area/lower wall area), POSTERIOR/POSTERO (back wall), SEPTAL/Septum (dividing wall), APICAL/APEX (bottom tip of the heart) and LATERAL (side wall).\n\nThe heart muscle has living cells/tissue in these areas. This indicates that clearing the blockage in the affected artery will be of benefit.\n\n3:\n\nPerfusion defect AFTER exercise AND at rest (FIXED defect)\n\nThere is one or more totally blocked coronary arteries and one has had damage done to the heart muscle because of a heart attack.\n\nThere is an area/areas of the heart muscle that has become scar tissue (scarring, scarred) because of the heart attack.\n\nThis area would not be able to make functional use of any oxygen even if blood flow to that area of the heart were completely restored.\n\n4:\n\nCombined reversible and fixed defects\n\nIt is common for individuals with coronary artery disease to have different degrees of blockages in different arteries.\n\nA heart attack has left a fixed defect in one area of the heart, but there is a reversible defect in another area of the heart due to a less severe blockage.\n\n.\n\nGood doctor-patient, patient-doctor communication and understanding is so very important, essential at ALL times.\n\nTake care,\n\nCardioStar*\n\nWebMD member (since 8/99)\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nBe well-informed\n\nHeartSite\n\nCoronary artery anatomy\n\nStarting with the left anterior descending (LAD,) the most critical, next to the ultra-critical left main (LM)\n\nhttp://www.heartsite.com/html/lad.html\n\n-\n\nQuote!\n\n\"Be a questioning patient.
