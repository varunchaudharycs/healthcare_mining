I had buckle and gas in one eye which detached when gas dissipated. I then had silicone oil injected which when removed resulted in detachment. This oil has been in my eye for almost three years and I developed a capsule fairly soon after surgery.\n\nOn the other eye, I had buckle fitted three years ago and it was successful until six weeks ago when I had another detachment. I had a vitrectomy with silicone inserted. All going well so far. I have good sight and a very strong prescription in my lense. I should state, I have a capsule in my first eye so have very little sight in that eye but I can see shapes, colour etc so I know it’s working.\n\nIn my last check up, my surgeon told me that he would be taking oil from my last operated eye. I asked if we could leave that alone for now and work on the eye with the capsule - he gave me time to think about it which is constantly on my mind.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nI’m sort of thinking of asking surgeon to take oil and capsule with a view to leaving it to see how the retina reacts. Am I mad? If he does, will I be living in fear forever? During my last visit, I mentioned removing the oil and capsule and reinserting oil. Has anyone been in this situation? I was informed that oil can be left in the eye for some time but eventually has to be removed.\n\nI’m also having second thoughts regarding the eye most previously operated on. I asked surgeon if we could leave in oil indefinitely but I’m now considering getting it removed later on in the year. I’m more confident about this eye as it repaired itself from first surgery and there was a very small tear which couldn’t be identified.\n\nWhat is the success rate for silicone oil removal? Have any readers similar stories? I should note that the reason for the detachments was no vitreous gel in my eyes causing tractional tears. Is there a way to prevent this?\n\nThanks in advance for any advise given. Apologies for the long story but I’ve had a lot of trouble with my eyes the past few years.

Desperate For Answers.","post_content":"Good evening,\n\nI will try and be compact. In 2013, after a long period of emotional difficulty in which I used extended video gaming as a balm, I experienced an intense migraine. Ever since, I have not been able to look at a computer screen for more than 20mins - 2hrs without suffering the same visual attack. This has affected my life enormously and I have been unable to pursue most avenues of employment, especially those related to my skillset and education.\n\nThe migraine begins with a feeling or soreness around the eyes. The veins on my head begin to pump. My eyes feel strained and then painful. It feels like they are trying to focus on something that isn’t there. This results in nausea, confusion and then escalates into a full-blown migraine, lasting on average 3 days. Under these circumstances working with a computer is out of the question. I am tormented by this and it has defined my experiences over the last half a decade to a horrifying degree.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\nI am male, 27. I wear glasses for close work (prescription correct), otherwise healthy.\n\nI had a squint in my right eye that was surgically corrected in Janruary. We were hoping that this would fix the issue but it unfortunately has not.\n\nThese visual attacks occur only when I look at computer screens/laptop screens and sometimes under intense lighting (office lighting is often particularly bad)\n\nI have tried Migralens and various computer glasses to see if blocking out harmful light waves would help, but the symptoms remain the same.\n\nI work to adjust screen brightness/contrast/colour and my posture and environment, have used f.lux, but this only increases my buffer before a migraine by a small amount.\n\nI am unaffected by kindle screens, books, and other close work.\n\nTextured, colourful images such as computer games or videos are much more manageable than information. Reading and writing on the screen will result in a quick deterioration.\n\nI am desperate. I have seen so many ophthalmologists and opticians who, whilst professional, simply are dumbfounded. Very few have any idea how to help or what to suggest and pass me along to the next department or person. This has been years of fruitless hospital visits. Whilst I am currently awaiting transfer back to a neurology department, I simply have lost faith that there will be a close enough investigation to get to the root cause of this. I must, must take control of my life again and this is my obstacle.\n\nIf there is anyone at all who has lived with this and come out the other side, please get into contact and let me know that there’s light at the end of this miserable tunnel. I have never met anybody who suffers in the same way and it makes me feel insane. If I could somehow return to a normal 9-5 job with a computer, my life would change dramatically. I am not soliciting medical advice - I am asking for hope, for stories of people beating this awful thing. Because this - I can’t stand this.\n\nThank you.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Nicke731","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: 5 Years Unable To Work With Computer Screens Due To Intense Visual Migraines.

My eyesight is perfect 20/20 and actually has improved in 10 years (slightly). She said that I had some slight yellowing in my lenses that could develop into cataracts 5-10 years down the road. That is all good news. I am 61 years old.\n\nMy concern is glaucoma. My pressures are good 17-18 which is where they were 10 years ago. Dr. said under 20 is where you want them to be. She then took a picture of each eye - a fundus photo I think it was called and compared the two pictures from 10 years ago till now. The optic nerve from 10 years ago showed a change in the left eye. She called it something else (I think it might have been a cup but not sure) said it looked a little longer than 10 years ago. In the right eye, she did not see much of a difference and attributed that to different camera etc.\n\nSo, she wants me to have a visual field test + some sort of scan. She said she is not diagnosing glaucoma but the left eye is suspicious enough to want to check out. As a result of the scan, she says they will either want to keep monitoring or start treatment. I assume if the advice is to keep monitoring it is not glaucoma yet. If it is start treatment, sounds like it means glaucoma has started. Treatment she says would be 1 drop in each eye (or maybe just the left) once before bedtime. So I have several questions:\n\n1. Does it sound like there is glaucoma here?\n2. Can it only affect 1 eye? And, do the drops work?\n3. thought drops were to relieve pressure, but if pressures are 17-18 why would I need drops?\n4.

My history is as follows: Had Lasik (and a touch up a month later) 20 years ago and unfortunately was not able to get these records from that doctor since my records were long since destroyed. Currently posterior chamber intraocular lenses are both with mild central posterior capsular plaque, and I also have severe dry eyes. Everything else is OK. My doctor has recommended YAG laser to clear the plaques, and thinks that it may be the plaques that are causing my horrible post-op vision, but I am hesitant as I understand it may be difficult to change my IOL later on if I have the YAG laser treatment. I also wonder if the doctor maybe put in the wrong power lenses? Doctor has ‘concluded’ that I will need glasses/another Lasik procedure done to correct my vision rather than him trying to re-calculate the Toric placements or try a different lens and is trying to scare me with all the risks by going back into the operating room...blah..blah..blah. But why would I want glasses or Lasik when I have paid for the premium lenses? And how in the heck is it possible that my vision is still actually worse after surgery 2 months later?

The doctor indicated that the optic nerve was pale and there was something behind the eye and that MRIs of the brain and orbit wwo was required because brain tumor, stroke, etc. were likely.\n\nMRIs at that time were out of range; however, a 2nd doctor recommended blood tests to rule out Giant Cell Arteritis which was done and proved negative.\n\nCurrent day: Friend now has insurance. One eye is blind. The other apparently has a significant cataract. The doctor is now saying that the blindness MIGHT be glaucoma and that the 2nd eye may also have glaucoma but the diagnosis won't be known until the cataract is removed.\n\nMRI scans of the brain and orbit were done. According to the report, there is no inflammatory change in the orbital fat. Extraocular muscles are normal in caliber. Globes unremarkable. No prophosis. No orbital mas. No fluid collection. Cavernous sinuses enhance symmetrically. Optic nerves are normal in signal and morphology and do not enhance with contrast. Optic chiasm is intact.\n\nMy friend fell and had untreated head trauma about 20 years ago. (Fell off ladder) They also had some type of reaction (allergy or perhaps infection) to dental work on the same side. The eye became inflamed with redness. Later x-rays at the time confirmed infection under the tooth. Of course years ago.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a factor. Medication started 2 weeks ago. Pressure is lower but fluctuates.\n\nDuring MRI when contract was added, a burning and slightly painful sensation was experienced on the side of the blindness. Emotional state is a roll-coaster. The electrical zapping feelings behind the ear on the blindness side are still there as is hearing the heartbeat.\n\nAlso according to the report: partially empty sella, mega-cisterna magna and a tiny pineal cyst wo mass effect. So as I understand it, these are things of note which may be nothing but need to be noted.\n\nModerate nonspecific signal abnormality within supratentorial white matter, basal ganglia, and pons. The radiologist suggests add'l correlation req. Possible toxic exposure to something like carbon monoxide.\n\nOther items of possible note. Ticks are a constant battle and have been for 20 years Never tested for lyme disease. Took care of a person with severe shingles. Does not show any outward signs of infection. Experienced episodes of extremely vivid \"visions\" after a close family member death.\n\nMy question for now because the eye surgery is scheduled for the near future is:\n\nIs a diagnosis of glaucoma consistent with the orbit MRI report? If not, could having the cataract surgery prior to figuring out why there's blindness in the bad eye be detrimental to the remaining \"good\" eye?\n\nI'm inclined to get a 2nd opinion rather than jump in. My friend wants to have the surgery next week in order to save the remaining eye and hopefully get back some of their vision.","like_count":"0","tags":["Cataracts","Vision Loss","Glaucoma"]},"responses":[{"author":"nelenol","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Eye Surgery","resp_content":"Depending on the grade of the cataract in the the good eye it sounds like it is blocking the doctor from getting retinal imaging done to determine if glaucoma is present.

I think I just feel like talking and getting it out. If anyone would like to respond, though, it would be most appreciated!\n\nFour years ago, I had a retinal detachment in my left eye that was successfully treated through surgery. Thing were going along fine, eye-wise, until last year when my optometrist diagnosed me with high eye pressure, which is a risk factor for glaucoma (which runs a bit on my mom's side of the family). Anyway, I received laser treatment in April 2017 (also on my left eye) to lower the pressure -- it actually worked so well that the pressure was decreased in both eyes, something that's not all that unusual.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure how I discovered it, but i noticed that the vision in my left eye was really blurry. I had no other symptoms, but got my glaucoma specialist routine appointment moved up a few days and she super-dilated my eyes and did all kinds of tests, noting that not much ad changed from our last visit (retina and optic nerve looked fine, etc.) and that I had a cataract in my left eye (and a lesser one in my right), something that we already know. She seemed to think that that's what the trouble was. Honestly, my vision has seemed to be going downhill slowly since the laser treatment, especially when I would wear my contacts and i was expecting a prescription change at my next optometrist appointment.\n\nSO, since then, I have been experiencing symptoms that I've attributed to a possible brain tumor-- but, as I've been told, could also be anxiety. I'd like to point out, that I don't really suffer from health anxiety in general, but when something goes wrong, it seems to kick in. Last January (due to stress I think) I had a headache for a month and was convinced it was a brain tumor. My PCP prescribed supplements, etc., and the headaches eventually went away.\n\nBut for the last week or so I've been headachy (nothing too bad), occasionally nauseous with a really gurgly stomach, my ears are really ringing, I feel generally blah (better in the AM, worse as the day goes on), when I wake up during the night, my hands are usually asleep (something that's been going on for a while, actually). I don't think these things would bother me as much if I hadn't experienced the somewhat sudden vision change in my one eye. Put together, these symptoms seem to point to a brain tumor.\n\nThe only think keeping me sane is the knowledge that this is the eye I've had trouble with in the past and it would make some kind of sense if something went wrong there again. But part of me thinks that since I started worrying about it, that's what started these odd symptoms. Part of me also thinks that I just have some kind of low-grade bug that's hanging on. I don't know. I just know that if it doesn't start improving, I'm going to go insane and grown further convinced that something is really wrong. My appointment with my retina doctor, my glaucoma doctor and the cataract surgeon aren't until the end of this month!\n\nWhat does everyone think? Thank you for listening.

As I wait for insurance to come through before I go back to the doctor, I’d like to open this up to the knowledge of the masses. I’ll try to keep this long story as short as possible.\n\nMy symptoms are as follows: For at least the past four years, I’ve been experiencing an intense concentrated pressure in my right temple behind my right eye. It’s chronic, altering between quite intense to rather mild, and it often spreads to the rest of my head, face, and neck. It almost feels as if some huge wrestler like Andre the Giant had his hand on my head and is squeezing, with his thumb on my right temple providing the most pressure there. I can feel a kind of twisting of the nerves in the pressure, as if there is something is alive in there, an unsettling thought.\n\nIf I’m working or generally keeping myself busy, then I barely notice the pressure. However, if I’m still, for example during meditation, when I’m watching a movie, or lying in bed at night, it’s very potent. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, just very intense, and it’s there pretty much all the time. However, once every three weeks or so, it does get strong enough that it actually becomes quite painful. Generally speaking, the pressure is more intense at night. This pressure has also affected the vision in my right eye which has decreased significantly over the past couple of years and is often blurry. Oddly, when the pressure is strong, massaging the temple or even simple touching it makes it go away almost instantly, only to return in full force when I remove my hand. There is no bulging or anything unusual I can feel on the temple - from the outside, it seems normal.\n\nLast year, I had a brain MRI scan which did not show any obvious problems. My doctor believed it was due to anxiety and prescribed medication which did seem to reduce the pressure initially, but only about 25% or so, and it has since returned in full force even with the meds. My eye doctor has also told me that there is nothing wrong with my right eye (having only checked with equipment in his office).\n\nIn my online research of this problem, I’ve seen many postings of similar symptoms, but never any that matched entirely. The possible causes also do not seem to match completely. Migraines, cluster headaches, and a sinus infection have been ruled out by my doctor. The MRI I suppose (and certainly hope) means that a tumor is probably not the cause (knock on wood). I assume glaucoma is out after my eye doctor gave my right eye a clean bill of health. A primary suspect, anxiety, is something that I live with daily but it does not stop me from living a normal life. Tension headaches are possible, but I have a hard time believing they could be chronic and could manifest themselves so specifically to such a small area. And even during times when the rest of me feels quite relaxed, the pressure remains, which leads me to believe that it is independent of the anxiety, that there’s something wrong behind my eye. Even when I was recently in a luxurious hotspring and my body had rarely felt so relaxed, the pressure raged as strong as ever.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? Is it possible they missed anything with the MRI? Do brain MRI scans cover the eyes as well? Could anxiety really manifest itself so strongly? Is it possible that eyestrain from working with computers over the past 15 years could be the culprit?\n\nThanks a lot for your time.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"madi29","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Intense, chronic pressure behind right eye","resp_content":"Did you see an ophthalmologist or an optometrist? Do you know why your vision has declined so much and the cause of your blurry vision? Has your vision been corrected with glasses or contacts or do you live with an imbalance in your visual acuity? Are you sensitive to lights or sunlight? Do you have dry eyes or watery eyes? Do you know if your eye doctor actually checked your eye pressures? I would suggest a full exam by an ophthalmologist, if you haven't had one already, and get any of these issues that may apply to you addressed. It's possible that it could be eye strain, caused by one or a combination of these issues, which may resolve with corrective lenses, sunglasses, eye drops, lifestyle changes, etc.\n\nI would also suggest getting your thyroid levels checked - ask for TSH, free T3 and free T4. Once you rule out eye and thyroid pathology, I would then consider allergies, sinus issues other than infections, a degenerative disk in the upper cervical spine, migraines and tension headaches. I assume you are a male, otherwise, given the location of the pain and your statement about the intensity in a cycle every 3 weeks or so, it sounds typical of a peri-menopausal woman experiencing migraines. The MRI would rule out a tumor and would include your eyes so I don't think they missed anything there.

I was given a lantern test and only got a couple right. I only passed because I could see a solid red and solid green square. During the last two years it's seemed to have gotten worse rather quickly. I can't play a lot of videogames now because a lot of stuff blends in and it's really difficult to see. I tried playing a videogame I used to play when I was younger and could not tell where certain things were because they were blending in. I never had that issue when I played it a few years ago. Is this something that normally happens? I'm extremely confused as to why it's getting more and more difficult really quickly, and why I was able to pass those tests only a few years ago. Is there anything I can do to help this?","like_count":"0","tags":["Vision Loss"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Color blindness?","resp_content":"I'd like to add it seems to be a bit easier to see in the dark\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/40416/color-blindness"},{"post":{"author":"proudgeekmama","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"PLEASE HELP!

In July of '17, Sandy said she felt an \"explosion\" in her left eye. She noticed that her pupil was no longer round. It was a bit larger & looked like it had a \"bite\" taken out of it. Without going into details, Sandy has no health insurance & it's been difficult to get the help I'm sure she needs. So, she went to the County Health Dept & was told to go to a hospital emergency room. The referred her to an eye doctor. She went to the eye doctor & was told \"you're out of my league\" & they referred her to a specialist. The specialist wasn't quite sure what it was, but suspected it was some kind of bacterial or viral infection. He prescribed some drops & meds, to no avail. It was then recommended that Sandy have surgery so they can get a sample of eye fluid & run tests to determine the exact cause of her condition. Since the beginning, Sandy has slowly been losing sight in that eye & it's only getting worse. The County Health Dept has refused to approve a referral to get the necessary surgery. They told her it was probably cataracts & as you get older, \"everybody gets them\"! Sandy is in the lengthy process of trying to get some form of aid, but time is of essence & I fear she'll go totally blind in that eye if left untreated for much longer. The doctors she has already been to have suggested that it's possible that, whatever it is in her left eye could spread to her right eye. That would be horrible!

The thing is I am already tired from my computer use, but I still have to force myself to wash the dishes by hand, attend to the dog, and cook dinner. I did this for the whole week.\n\nAnyway, after that week, I noticed that my dizziness (the light-headed-ness sort and not the world-is-turning-around kind), won't leave even if I stop using computer for a long amount of time.\n\nI have noticed that whenever I strain my eyes (read a book, watch TV, computer use, but especially computer use), this light-headed-ness intensifies. And this is with me until the next day.\nLately though I've noticed that my recovery time have improved, but the dizziness is still there.\n\nI have already visited the doctor twice. Took the prescribed anti-vertigo pills for three days, changed the prescription of my glasses, and had my blood tested. My blood content is normal, my BP normal, my heart and breathing okay, I don't know what's wrong with me.\n\nI hope I get well soon. I can't forever avoid computers, since they are a necessity. And I'm not saying that because I'm fond of the internet. School and jobs rely on the internet after all.\n\nPlease help. Thank you.\n\nUpdate:\nLight-headed-ness is 24/7 though it doesn't bother me much while on the computer. It's more felt while I'm walking or moving. Feels like I'm floating somehow, almost camera-fish-eye feel but not quite.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/33862/light-headedness-for-more-than-a-month"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Wide variety of stuff going on","post_content":"One week ago I woke up with pink eye, went to the DR. the next day and it already spread to the other eye.

I'll begin with the very beginning\n\nI started a job as a Meat clerk at a grocery store. I would just put meat into the cases and clean the saw room where everything was cut. After a few months on this job I developed a really bad eye twitch in the skin of the lower part of my eyelid, this was only happening on my right eye. It eventually progressed where when I tried to focus with that eye whatever I was focusing on was moving left and right very fast. Then I lost the ability to move the top half of my lip on the right side. I also was breaking out in cold sores maybe every other week at this time. I went to the doctor and they said the twitch and breakouts were stress, the lip was bellspalsy and put me on acyclovir after a week I had regained control and the twitching stopped as well as the breakouts.\n\nI went months symptom free and now I have this going on. I started a job where I was standing stationary on a mat and just matching work gloves together and wrapping them in bundles to be cleaned. My first day on this job caused my a lot of neck pain and soreness in the legs and lower back. I ended that day and went home and took some ibuprofen and ate protein hoping to heal what I worked so i'd be ready for the next day. I started the next days shift and 1-2 hours in the pain became unreal in my neck so I took another dose of ibuprofen. I lasted another hour while the pain was getting worse to the point of anxiety and uncomfortably just trying to do the job. It got so bad I had to sit down in the restroom and I remember almost throwing up as well. I explained to my boss what was going on and asked If I could leave for the day, he said that was fine. I punched out and on the walk to my car It felt like everything was moving and I remember just walking and randomly falling to the right. The actual drive home was even worse, it felt I was looking at the rode with my head tilted and my head wasn't tilted. I had gotten a call shortly after and was relieved from the job. So I've been trying figure out whats going on. I went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and explained to him what happened. They took xrays of my neck and said the top of my spine was curving. He had me do a test where he wanted me to keep my right arm elevated in front of me at a certain height and with my eyes closed lift the left arm to the same height, I did what I thought was the same level and the left one was about a hand length lower than the right. He wanted to look at my legs as well because of my balance and after putting my legs together he said my right leg was 3/4 of an inch out of place. He did some adjustments in my legs and neck which helped things a lot. The tilted vision got better but now I have something else going on. I'm walking really goofy, a friend described it as stiff leg or drunk walk. My vision is fine looking at something straight ahead until it gets far then my vision wants to look down. I lay in bed watching tv from the side of my eyes and words will sometimes be doubled on top of the word, and just trying to keep my eyes looking at one specific thing its like everything is slowly sliding up or my eye keep wanting to drag down im not sure which is happening. Now just trying to stand in place my legs get shaky and I'll even just fall to the right or forward, never backward or left.

The term doctors use for this is \"amblyopia.\" This can cause double vision and trouble with \"depth perception.\"\n\nThe most common cause of lazy eye is crossed eyes. When people have crossed eyes, their eyes don't line up or move together. This can happen all the time or only when a person is tired. When someone has crossed eyes, each eye sees and sends a different image to the brain. This is confusing for the brain, so the brain ignores the images from one eye. Over time, the ignored eye becomes weaker and doesn't see as well.\n\nOther eye problems can also cause lazy eye. Common causes for lazy eye in adulthood include lazy eye since childhood, vision loss, and muscle or nerve weakness.\n\nTreatment for lazy eye involves making the weaker eye work harder so that it can get stronger. To make the weaker eye work harder, the doctor can do things like use an eye patch to cover over the stronger eye.\n\nTreatment for crossed eyes is focused on ways to make the eyes line up and work together. The doctor can also do this by using special prism glasses.\n\nIf these treatments don't work, or if you have severe crossed eyes, you may need surgery to fix the eye muscles. This type of surgery usually does not require hospitalization, although that depends on your health and your doctor’s recommendation. After surgery, most people return to nearly all normal activities within several days.\n\nBest of luck to you!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/19531/eye-health"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Eye Health","post_content":"I am a 54 year old and i stopped taking my eye drops for five months.

I'm a certified Ophthalmic assistant. To answer your question about the strain-No, it will not affect your eye pressure. Eye pressure is very similar to blood pressure, stress can cause it to rise, along with other factors. There are several different types of Glaucoma. There is even a type called \"Low-tension Glaucoma\", where even a normal pressure (under 20) causes damage to the optic nerve. And then there are, like you said, other people that run pressures of 25, without any damage. It all depends on the person, if there's a family history, if the patient has narrow anterior chamber angles, asymmetrical optic disc cupping, etc. then they begin to suspect Glaucoma if a patient shows elevated intraocular pressure. And yes, no matter your age, it can happen. Although, more common in older adults.\n1\n"},{"author":"shadowmedical","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Eye pressure","resp_content":"The only symptoms of glaucoma are a loss in side vision.

Looks like the opposite of tunnel vision.","post_content":"Two months ago (March) I had a migraine that lasted for a week. When it finally went away, I started getting really bad neck pains and my eyesight was bad.( This has happened twice before in the last two years but they were so spread apart that I couldn't remember how long it lasted each time.) Just before my migraine started, I went to the doctor's for help with my weight and I was put on Levothyroxine 125mg because i have an underactive thyroid and I hadn't taken my medicine in years. I also majorly changed my diet. Everyone who I would talk to blamed the migraine and neck pains on the major changes, but that wouldn't explain why it happened in the past. So I decided that I would wait it out and bring it up to my doctor in two weeks at my next appointment. When I brought everything up and explained the best I could about my vision, my doctor did very basic neurological tests to rule out the vision loss being a problem in my brain. She decided that it wasn't anything neurological and it was just a symptom of the migraine and it could be lasting longer because not only were my hormones out of wack (just ended my period), but I also made a very big lifestyle change. I was given a shot for the neck pains and was prescribed migraine medicine. The shot lasted two days and my eyes weren't any better. That was at the very end of March. Fast-forward to now when I just noticed my neck doesn't hurt anymore but my eyes... I start college in the fall and I don't have my license because I can't drive because I can't see.\nI basically am going through the opposite of tunnel vision, but only sometimes (it's happened twice while typing this). It happens all the time everyday. If I'm looking at one thing then look at something else and go back to what I was looking at before, I can't see it. It also happens when I open my eyes after sleeping, if I blink longer than usual, and when I stand up and change rooms. Most times I can see with my peripheral vision but, occasionally, all vision goes away for the most part of a minute. When I can't see, it's not pitch black but it's almost like a snowy tv channel. It sometimes seems like it's brought on by light changes but I don't know.\nIf you have has a similar experience, let me know. It would be great to know I'm not the only one. More importantly, if you know what this is or what's causing it, please let me know cause I got tired of this after one day, it's been almost 60 now.","like_count":"0","tags":["Vision Loss"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/7849/loss-of-vision-throughout-the-day-looks-like-the-opposite-of-tunnel-vision"},{"post":{"author":"ale6rbd","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Difference between two eyes","post_content":"I recently got a new pair of glasses but on the left eye I have a plain lens and for the right eye the diopter is +2.50 spherical and +1 cylindrical with an axis of 95 degrees.

By 7:00am that morning my husband and I were at the emergency room. I wasn't able to tolerate any light at all. I wore a blindfold to the hospital and had to be taken into a dark room where the doctor's made a tent and placed it over my head so they could examine my eyes. That was painful, but I had to have it done. Well, after several eye drops and exams that day I was diagnosed with Iritis. It's when your iris becomes inflamed. Two months later I am still on steroid eye drops and if I stop the drops, the symptoms return. Right now I have one more week left with the eye drops and I hope it's healed.

I have been wearing glasses for the last 15 years. In September 2016 I started having issues where mid and distance vision deteriorated to the point that I had to look out of the bottom of my glasses to read highway signs. Vertical and horizontal lines had a slight shadow alongside the line. I had surgery to remove cataracts from both my eyes. At the consultation I was offered the opportunity to upgrade the lens implant to a bifocal lens or an accommodating lens. I was told that my distance vision would be corrected with any lens I chose. I was also informed that since my prior RK correction was minor, if I chose to upgrade to an accommodating lens that I may have an opportunity to correct for near, mid and far vision. The downside would be that I may require reading glasses. I chose to upgrade and pay a premium for an accommodating lens. My left eye was done first a TRULIGN IOL lens was prescribed prior to surgery. The morning of the surgery the surgeon said that he decided to implant a normal Crystal IOL lens and that if required he would complete a laser correction at a latter date. Two weeks later a Crystal IOL lens was implanted in my right eye. Both implants are: AT-50AO, Diopter 25.50, Optic Dia 5.0mm, Overall Dia 11.5mm.\n\nI am now experiencing vision issues for mid and distance vision. I can still distinguish a shadow on lines. Near vision is good.\n\nMy 2015 and 2016 vision prior to cataract surgery was:\n\nOD +1.25 +1.00 165 Add+2.50\nOS +1.50 +1.00 179 Add+2.50\n\nAfter surgery:\n\nOD -2.00 +1.75 178. Add+2.50\nOS -1.75. +1.25 180 Add+2.50\n\nThe technician and optometrist that examined me after the surgery said that they can understand why I am concerned. My surgeon suggests that the outcome is within the acceptable range. The surgeon provided a prescription as noted above. It almost seems like they had in stock IOL's to use.

I just assumed that sitting in a dark room for a while was just irritating. I'm starting to think that isn't it. I have a double astigmatism and have prescription glasses for it, but I hardly notice the difference with my glasses on or off. The main reason why I even wear my glasses is because my eyes will get tired easily. I guess you could say it is like a pressure in my eyes that makes my whole body and mind feel like it should be tired. For the past year, it feels like my glasses aren't working anymore. My eyes get tired more regularly almost as if I'm not wearing my glasses. I had my vision checked and my prescription is the same. I'm also having a little harder time focusing on the road when it is dark out. I am still safe at driving at night, but if it gets worse then I will have to limit my driving to daytime only. I have started to get migraines as well, but those are genetic in my family and I've noticed they are only triggered when I'm stressed, so I don't think that it relates to my eye troubles. Could all of these be symptoms of something? I'm a college student and I'm taking anatomy and physiology right now and I tried asking my teacher, but he doesn't know why the movie theaters hurt my eyes and why my vision with and without my glasses doesn't matter too much.
