However, a consultant at the Barberry centre has diagnosed him with functional movement disorder. He has attended support groups for this but when seeing other patients with FMD, he feels misdiagnosed and I agree with him. A lot of patients were in wheelchairs and had ME and other restricting conditions.\n\nOne day in 2009 whilst at work, my husband just dropped down and collapsed. He wakes straight up once he has hit the floor, but he cant always feel when a black out is coming on. His boss saw it happening and sent him off sick, unfortunately with no diagnoses for the blackouts or treatment , he is left unable to drive or work...11 years later we are still in the same boat.\n\nHis tics were bought on one night after he had vomited, he started having tics mainly in the neck, head and neck jerking. Sometimes in his leg. However, they've got more prominent and new tics have recently occurred in recent years, including whistling, clicking the tongue, slapping, tapping a pattern, head jerking, head shoots up to look at the ceiling and wont come down, sniffing, facial expressions, jigging the legs when stood up.... of course this shouts tourettes to me, as it probably does to you but the consultant (before retirement) was adamant it wasnt. I also researched epilepsy and found 'absent seizures' which is identically to what he experiences before, during and after a black out but the standard epilepsy test ruled it out. Due to his journey and lack of understanding, it has resulted in anxiety, which he is managing for the first time in years without medication as he didnt feel it made a difference. It's also worth noticing, we are unsure of hereditary issues as his dad was adopted and does not know anything of his biological background.\n\nWe tried to get a second opinion but the consultant he saw was the best in the world according to the hospital 'Mr Rickards' which then focuses on the power hierarchy as no other professional would chance stepping on his toes and criticising his work.\n\nIf anybody has the same symptoms or knows of a connection between tics and black outs, please reply to this thread.\n\n\nThank you!\nNatasha (& John)","like_count":"0","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/111746/anybody-with-similar-symptoms"},{"post":{"author":"kenkulow","post_time":"1 month ago","post_title":"?

Loosing hope... :(","post_content":"Hi.\nMy name is Megan Lofthouse, I'm 24 years old and I live in the UK.\nSo after crying for what felt like hours, I've decided to contact you guys. However I keep forgetting that it's on a website and that if I minimise this, I will loose everything I've written. It's annoying because I got really far with this message! So now I'm writing it on a blank email, so that; if I forget and minimise this, I won't loose everything I've just written.\n\nSo this isn't complete because now things have got so bad that my brain is now completely blank and I've lost so much strength that I can barely type. My hands and feet have gone completely numb, I can't feel pain; its just dulled pain. I can't feel emotions, yet with a flick off a switch, I'm either angry or crying. I have no idea where it comes from either...\n\nAnyway, I'm in The Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, UK and I'm desperate for your help.\nI've been in the acute admissions unit for over 4 months and I'm progressively just getting worse.\nIt's hard for me to type now as I don't have the strength and my fingers hurt, but I'm desperate. I have my phone rested on the bottom bar of my bed, very close to me. This is because I don't have the strength to even hold my phone.\nSo, until today, I was pretty sure that I had autoimmune encephalitis. However today, I found out that my mri scan came out normal.\nHowever today (11th of January 2020) I've just realised that, Susanah (the writer and survivor, who wrote the true book brain on fire) had all normal test results too. So there is still a possibility that I have it.\nThey've sent off 4 test tubes of blood off to test for antibodies that'd indicate that I have encephalitis. However, I'm told that these blood tests won't come back for weeks. Also blood tests aren't always that reliable either. They've sent a urin sample off too.\nA neorologist saw me on the 8th of January 2020.he did several reflex tests and during it. My right leg started shaking out of control. He thinks that my reflexes are over working and that the link between my brain and my legs aren't working properly. He also moved my toes up and down and asked if I knew which way my toe was pointing. It felt weird and I could tell but not fully. (if that makes sense)\nRight now they are questioning if it's mitochondrial, however I'm not convinced. I already have a rare chromosome deletion called 2q37.3; why would I have another DNA problem..? Plus it doesn't solve why I'm having auditory and visual hallucinations.\nI'm also told they are due to do more scans.\nSomeone told me that I should request a ct scan (cat scan) would that show anything when mri doesn't..?\nI feel so low and I feel like a freak, a freak that no one knows what's wrong with..\n\nSo right now my symptoms are:\nWorsening headaches that spread too my neck\n\nJoint pain\n\nBack pain\n\nEye pain (can't open my eyes very well)\nWeakness that suddenly came on (can't sit up or even hold my head up)\n\nSeeing/ hear in things (I can \"hear\" people talk about me, that sound very real; but they aren't. I have too wait for my parents too go to bed before I go to bed, because otherwise I will \"hear\" them talking about, causing me to cry. Even if I do though, it doesn't really help. I can't talk to someone and let them walk away without \"hearing\" them talk about me. I used too have to pretend to go to the toilet, so I could go past the living room; just to check they weren't talking about me. I thought that everyone was out to get me and that they were talking about me. And I didn't believe them when they say they don't; because I can hear it. Right now I'm hearing a high pitched noise that no one else can hear, tried recording the sound but even that didn't pick it up. It happens a lot at night.\nI can't see properly, so when my dad got me to practice opening my eyes to look at a picture; every time I looked at it, the picture would change, I got it wrong every time. Plus apparently it was the same picture every time, but to me the picture kept changing. I looked at a picture, it was of my sisters on Christmas day one year; except I didn't recognise that it was of both of my sisters. Because to me, one had strands of blue hair. Later found that this was actually my sister wearing a blue Christmas cracker hat.\nI'm in hospital right now, and I was convinced my room was a different shape and bigger than it actually is. This confused me so much. I could see windows that weren't there, doors that weren't there, a bookshelf that wasn't there. A purple settee and a brown arm chair that wasn't there. A clock and stairs? That weren't there.\nI thought my bed was slanted or tilted, or thought I was high up. (my mum thought it was because I can't see)\nI thought my bed was triangular and sometimes thought I had somehow got my body the opposite way round (so my head was where my feet was and my feet were where my head was.\nObviously this still confuses me, but yeah..\n\nLack off sleep (haven't slept properly in over a month and I take strong sleeping tablets)\nThe only time I can sleep is when I cry for hours, like last night (the 10th of January 2020) I think this is because crying makes me exhausted.\n\nDramatic mood swings/ outbursts (change in behavior)\n\nSudden impulsive outbursts. (had to be restrained by two/three people a few days ago. They said I was out of control)\n\nWorsening mood and mental health (feel invisible!)\n\nIncreasing sickness (take two different types off anti sickness tablets. I used to take three but they thought that the third (metaclorfromide) caused my incontinence with number 2, back when I was in Southampton General Hospital. This wasn't the case!)\n\nDizziness\n\nMobility changes (went from walking too not even being able too sit up and its the third time! Every time it happens, it's always worse than the last!)\n\nShort term memory thats just getting worse and worse (forgot my dad's phone number a few days ago and I've known that, even before I even memorised mine.\nLast night (3.1.2020) I was talking too my friend online and I realised how much I couldn't remember. Its scary actually. So the last think I can remember talking too my friend; was actually two years ago. I don't remember any recent conversations, it's all blank. I know we had more conversations than that, because I looked at our conversation history. Also on the 9th of January 2020, my advocate from mind, was supposed too come and see me; but I forgot. I only remembered when he texted me to cancel due to car problems. On the 11th of January 2020, I completely forgot about the whole conversation with my friend online. I only remembered when I was scrolling through my phone and saw the messaging icon on my phone.)\n\nStruggling too go for a wee and so I'm now having to force myself to go (not pleasant. And now I have a catheter, because I was retaining over 500)\n\nI'm constipated and laxatives don't seem to work now.i think on the 7th of January 2020, I had to have an enema for the first time and it was so painful that I screamed. Starting from the 8th of January 2020 I became incontinent. This was just overflow and stopped after a few days, but then started again. Today, on the 11th of January 2020 I found out that I'm still being given a heavy lot of laxatives. I don't think this is the cause of my incontinence though, as; I think that I was given laxatives constantly, from before the 7th. I only had one day off them and that was on the 9th. This is strange because, normally one sachet of movicol turns me incontinent. Before I had the enema, I had been given: two sachets of movicol, docisate sodium and two lots of suppositories in one day. Nothing worked)\n\nAntidepressants, antipsychotics and painkillers not working now.\nI'm on paracetamol, oramorth (morphine sulthate) dihydrocodeine, ibuprofen, buscopan, amatriptaline, peppermint oil, deloxatine, quatiapine, omeprazole, cefalexine (my profalactic antibiotic), cyclazine, ondansatron, zopiclone, my anti histomeine, movicol, scenna, docisate sodium and suppositories.\nAnd no, the strong painkillers are not the reason of why I was so constipated. I was on them for the whole of the time I've been here and I've been here for over three months now; throughout that time, I've been incontinent several times. I've never stopped taking the strong painkillers!)\n\nWhen I could walk; at night I found myself struggling too (thought this was my quatiapine, but now I'm not so sure)\n\nStruggling too talk because I forget what I'm saying, so can't complete sentences. Sometimes I don't even make sense, forget what I've said and repeat myself; and come out with random stuff sometimes.\n\nTaking longer than usual too read stuff because of my eyesight issues.\n\nTroubles concentrating. (will read something and then forget what I'm reading. The same for listening too stuff.\n\nSaying stuff then a few hours later, forgetting what I said\n\nAlso I can't stop swearing and I get angry at anything and everything\n\nI've had a urin infection for over three months and it's reaccuring and the last one was an e coli infection.\n\n(when I could walk) At night, when it's dark; I try too stand up but quickly loose my balance and fall into things\n\nI climbed a mountain in the lake district once and I struggled. Once at the top, my legs could no longer hold my body weight. This caused me too repeatedly fall over. My dad had too help me down and it was so hard that I kept falling, getting up was also very hard.\n\nI've fainted several times and I got a black eye by fainting once.\n\nI don't really remember this but, before being admitted; apparently it looked like I passed out, my eyes were rolling too. All I can remember is feeling very low and just out off it.\n\n\nI'm having massive identity crisis, where I'm questioning who I am now and even my own identity. (voices in my head told me that if I just woke up one day, I could just push everything about me away and sayim someone else. I was convinced this would help me. I was going too deny my identity and change how I look and who I was, change everything about me)\n\nA horrible sore throat (some people thought it was oral thrush as I have a white tongue)\n\nIncreasing pain and sickness (my pain is just unbearable right now and it's just getting worse every hour and every day; as that gets worse, so does my sickness)\n\nFreaking out about stuff (so on my first night in AAU; I had these horrible nightmare dreams, where I was just floating (very complicated) then suddenly I had a reality shock of where I was, but when I woke up, it felt like I had just come back too life. Gasping as I woke up. I didn't even realise I had gone to sleep, so I screamed. It honestly felt like i had just been resuscitated back from the dead. This obviously scared me.\nHowever then I thought I heard myself scream over and over again, like they were watching a recording off me. I thought the room had like an upper office with like a huge glass window, so that they could see us. I thought I heard them say \"the doctors gonna want to see this\"\nThen later \"why would you test on her, it's just her first night\"\nI then thought they had put something down my tube and done a test on me, too make me have the nightmare dream and have that reaction and feeling of being resuscitated back too life.\nThen later on I thought I heard \"liar, liar, its all in your head\"\n\nThe next evening/night, I thought they were having a secret meeting about me in the next room. My dad said no one was talking about me, but I could \"hear\" them. It's like I could hear it and my dad couldn't.\nSo I heard t\n\n\nAlso I don't know if this is relivent or not but I have got this internal itching down below that is a mystery too my doctors\n\nSo I've got various different diagnosises and my symptoms are a mystery too my doctors.\nI have been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, anorexia, BPD (supposedly) autism, a rare chromosome deletion called 2Q37.3 and ehlers danlos syndrome.\nHowever I think I have encephalitis and that is the cause off my mystery symptoms and illnesses.\nI also have an ng tube due too NY anorexia and have been sectioned since the 12th of July 2018.

I think melatonin is a better choice for you, and hopefully that will help with your sleep . Is there no one you can get to be with you, so you can discuss your worries and treatment plan? Remember to put some nice photos, memories into your day, so you can have a focus on something positive, even if only for a few minutes to begin with.\nReply\njoolaa\n1 month ago\nAlso, I see you have been sectioned and have a feeding tube. That is along time to have not eaten normally. How did they treat your anorexia? Any psychological help? The cocktail of drugs you are on will distort your thinking processes, and ability to concentrate and remember. Can your advocate from Mind get more involved with what is happening to you? Would you reconsider your choice not to eat? Perhaps you have to break this cycle yourself, by choosing something \"normal\" which may give the Drs the motivation to really look at your care.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/109321/mystery-illness-loosing-hope"},{"post":{"author":"nadamoustafa87","post_time":"1 month ago","post_title":"help me with diagnosis please","post_content":"almost 4 or 5 years ago i experienced severe dizziness it was bad i lost track of time i used to faint had nausea i couldn't get up from bed could't concentrate or even study for my exams it was hard to even read text messages on my phone after visiting many doctors it was suggested to be benign paroxysmal vertigo i had the maneuver and i felt like the fog on my eyes and brain disappeared i experienced it for 3 times the same year and the it was suggested to be migraine i would't be able to get out of bed for as long as a month and that's when i decided i have to live with it but since that year i felt like i never returned to normal i have trouble concentrating keeping up in a conversation it fees like brain fog sometimes i feel like i can't see well sometimes when i am not home i feel like i don't know or i can't keep up where am i it feels like i don't know how my legs are moving shortly after i started having breathing problems when i wake up and severe headaches they feel different everytime\nand the i started feeling tinglings in my left arm and legs and this year i sarted having trouble in my left part of the face severe pain my face used to be a symmetrical\nover the 5 years nausea fatigue headaches all where common\ni also started having trouble during my sleep sometimes its very hard to fall a sleep others i sleep alot but i always wake up tired\ni had an MRI it was normal i removed my wisdom teeth to make sure it wasn't pressuring the nerves i felt better after a while but then its pain again my face, my neck my head its sometimes hard to get up\nsudden nausea\nalthough all tests say that i am normal but i don't feel so\nall the pain and the weird symptoms are stressing me the fact that even doctors believe i have nothing is stressing me because i feel pain one that i can't describe all the time symptoms that aren't related and i wish if i could just know what is wrong\ni even underwent depression medications but i don't feel depressed i am actually happy and proud of my achievements\ni wish if i could just wake up one day without feeling tired or without new symptoms i really need help i need to feel that people know i am actually experiencing pain and i am not happy about it\ni even stopped telling how i feel just because people around me always say that i am always sick","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/109698/help-me-with-diagnosis-please"},{"post":{"author":"hankj1953","post_time":"2 months ago","post_title":"Burning of skin","post_content":"It seems every time I have stress my body reacts with burning skin.

I am a 42 year old male of relative decent shape. Throughout my life, I thought I was having anxiety attacks as early as 15 years old which seemed relatively minor, very few occurred, and I told no one until I was about age 31 or 32 when I stared to notice gaps in time. I would have the familiar feeling that I was about to faint. I sought out medical attention, but due to my employment situation and lack of insurance, I was unable to seek out proper care. These attacks seemed to reduce in frequency until I was around the age of 38. This time the attacks were more often and more intense. I lived alone for the majority of my life and wasn’t fully aware of what was occurring during these blackouts. My girlfriend witnessed a seizure and informed me of what happened. After keeping a journal, and a frequency chart, I have been unable to see a reoccurring pattern. The seizures occur about twice a month, but one could happen in one month, then I could have five the next. I was prescribed keppra first, and more seizures occurred. Then I was prescribed lamictal, again, more problems than help. The medical bills started to pile with the addition of two ER visit.\nOk. Do you think it would be a good decision to start self physical therapy and begin workouts which such seizures occurring? My concern is; Is increasing my core and muscular strength going to result it more physical trauma when the seizures occur?

I really wish there was more awareness about the condition, hence this long post. It reveals a lot of personal information in the hope that it will help another sufferer to feel less alone, or seek help, or maybe help a doctor/neurologist to assist in the treatment of other PLMT patients. At the expense of all the info, I really hope I do not sound too introspective. I just want, above all, to help someone in a similar position to myself.\n\nA brief medical background: I am 49, of average weight (~120lb at 5' 6\"). I have never smoked, I don't drink or take illicit drugs. In my childhood I had chicken pox, very bad measles, mumps and in my mid 20's, shingles. At age 19 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia, weighing 64lb. During and after my recovery from anorexia, to the current day, I have been taking many different antidepressant medications, and other psychiatric meds, including first, second and third generation antipsychotics for severe treatment resistant depression, OCD and Bipolar disorder.\n\nPrior to the onset of my PLMT, I was very active. I participated in advanced figure skating, ballet and yoga. In my younger years, up until my inability to walk properly due to anorexia, I was a competitive, national level figure skater with a very rigorous training regime. After my illness and a a 17 year break from the sport, I continued to skate quite rigorously and compete nationally on the adult circuit, until I tore the ACL ligament in my right knee. I did not have any PLMT symptoms at that time, and I had a successful donor transplant of the ACL in 2010.\n\nThe PLMT (undiagnosed at this stage) started approx. mid 2013. I remember the first painful spasms in my upper leg (in the quad) driving home from coaching one day. It became quite impossible to continue driving the car and I had to pull over at the nearest Med Express. Just prior to this I had been having a lot of trouble sitting due to pain in the ischium ['sit bone' area]. Doctors either told me it was all in my head or that it was piriformis syndrome and sent me to rehab. Extensive rehab was ineffective. All around the same time I had a fall and tore all three hamstrings in my upper right leg near the ischium. This was disheartening as I had recently taken up ballet and loved this new found activity so much that I continued to try and dance through the pain. Subsequently, the hamstrings did not heal well. It didn't end there. Due to the leg spasms, I started experiencing problems in my ACL again where the pin was inserted, so had to have the pin removed under anesthesia. To compound the picture further, I stopped most of my psych medications suddenly at the same time. I just remember feeling extreme pain all over my body, like a thousand little gates were opening and closing on every area. Thus, it is actually hard to define what caused the PLMT.\n\nMy neurologist, Dr. Homayoun is really great, and has spent so much time trying to work out the right treatments for me and how to help this rare disorder. I too, really try and study the pattern of movement and pain. I can control the movements when I think about controlling them, but I am quickly distracted because it takes a lot of mental energy. The PLMT is worse when I am at rest or lying down, and best when my feet are on the floor, or I am standing up moving around. I have major leg spasms however, even when standing, when my medication levels drop, or I have missed my dose of Lyrica, and/or the Botox is wearing off. In fact, most of my home life when I am not standing up is conducted lying down on the bed on my belly, either with my laptop, a book, doing crafts, etc., as I cant sit down much (still experience extreme pain in both ischium).\n\nAs far as medications: Aside from my psych meds (Effexor ER, Adderal and Abilify) I take Lyrica (600mg day), clonazepam, tizanadine, and baclofen. I also have about 10 injections of Botulotoxin (botox) at one session, every 3 months in between my toes, in other foot areas, and also all up my leg. It's excruciating when given in my foot, but helps a lot with the movement disorder. Recently, after mentioning some new observations at my appointment, I found that new injection points - in the side of the calf and in the groin (where I found that movement appeared to originate in the lower and upper leg respectively) and in the ischium, helped tremendously. I would also like to say that in the beginning stages of treatment, the Botox treatments seemed useless as they would only last about 6 weeks, and the effect wasn't great. It wasn't until over a year later that the Botox started lasting almost 3 months and really quite well. So if you have started such treatment, please do not lose hope!\n\nAlthough all these meds and treatments perhaps work interactively to control my leg movements and pain, by observing missed doses of the various meds, I find that it is the Lyrica, probably along with Botox, that is the most beneficial med in the control of both pain and movement. In fact, when the Botox is wearing off (after about 2 months) and I miss a day of Lyrica, the pain is so impossibly bad that I curl up in bed and just cry. Recently I have been prescribed a Fentanyl patch (25ug/hr) to also assist in controlling pain. I find they are ok, but not fabulous, in treating the pain, but do help to some extent. One day if I am brave, I will miss my lyrica without a patch on. I found it amusing, that when I missed my last Botox injections, I observed my toes were still rhythmically moving when I had the Fentanyl patch on (thus had no pain). This is interesting with regards to theories on the pain-movement cycle.\n\nWell I hope this LONG, long dialogue /info helps anyone, and please post if you want to if you are suffering from this condition or are a doctor etc - I feel so isolated! We need to build awareness of this complicated disease. I was so active and now when trying to fight back by practicing some strengthening or yoga, I find it is a big problem. I am becoming so weak and it is getting harder to dress because I am compensating by overusing other muscles which subsequently hurt more. I sometimes lose my balance and I feel like I am becoming more and more bedridden - Yikes! I look back on my skating days with great memories but it too, is so very, very painful - it hurts my psyche. I am so very thankful to my awesome psychiatrist and therapist, Dr. L Krimer. I don't know where I would be without his unconditional support. My extremities may be weak, but the center holds.

Its amazing I saw your response - I though I deleted the original post before I posted it!","resp_content":"Wow what a story you have too! I really empathize with you. I am so, so glad I've met on this forum! I'll keep an eye on your posts now. Are the doctors really helping you or just taking an interest? Did think your injury started with a fall off your bike or anything similar or have you ever been on a neuroleptic? (I actually had a fall and have been on a neuroleptic so my whole case is confounded). I really, really advise you not to get your foot amputated. I mean I hear you, and Ive thought of it myself. But, have you heard of painful limb syndrome? What if you or I got painful phantom leg/toes syndrome? So little is known about this disease that you really cant guess at what happen.\nI was wondering if you had tried botox injections in your leg? I get them every 3 months from the neurology department- in the foot, toes and up in various places in my leg. The foot is the most painful but if you put 4% lidocaine on it even 1/2 an hr beforehand then its not too bad. At first botox did not seem to help much, but the effect grew and grew (unless you get a batch that isn't as effective as the batch before). I haven't tried tramadol; I really don't know if baclofen and klonopin are as effective as antispasmodics as they should be in me. The Fentanyl really helped the pain in my leg but the spasms still occur. The main issue is that this really started with pain in the ischium and hamstrings, mainly the former - and fentanyl does not help this pain, and its dragging me down further and further. My neurologist has an associate he knows at a pain clinic here in Pittsburgh so that's where I go. I'm not fond of the whole idea. I have not taken non prescription/illicit drugs and even though I've never doctor shopped or filled my scripts before they are due, the drug contract, I find, is already labelling me (and I do give random urine samples that samples the other controlled drugs I take too that come back really good) I started with oxycodone 1 tablet 3 times a day, and nearly 2 years later was at the same dose. This helped the ischium and hamstring and PLMT, but the pain killing effect never really did last as it wasn't an extended release formula. I was eventually put on fentanyl as its around the clock, but it doesn't help the ischium and hamstrings. I cant sit for long or drive a car for long without pain starting. When not sleeping, I'm still constantly on my belly in bed reading, doing art or on my laptop when I'm not teaching as sparsely as I do. I think a lot of that is depression too. Today was such a bad day. I was so, so stressed out today with it all. I've cried until there were no tears left.\nDue to the fact that I want to try and get fitter, I may quit fentanyl soon. Im starting with aqua therapy tomorrow as I've just grown really weak, its horrifying. I want to attempt to get back to some activities again,at least some dance or a milder form of skating. The problem is Im so competitive with myself and I always remember how I was!\nAnyway, again, Im so glad I heard from you! Please keep that foot for now until more things are tried. Im here for you, on this forum anyway, so chat away! Hang in there. Thanks so for responding and I'll keep an eye out for your posts! All the best :)\n1\nReply\nmikey44\nover 2 years ago\nMshka, you are the only person I have ever \"spoken\" with who has PLMT.\n\nMost MD's have never heard of it, including one neurologist. PLMT is \"interesting\" to them, several have asked permission to take videos for teaching purposes. I have been referred to a world expert, Dr. Tony Lang in Toronto--but he declined to see me, because \"there is currently no way of treating this disorder effectively\".\nDespite this unfortunate prognosis, I'm not depressed and am continuing to seek palliative treatment--one day at a time. So far I have avoided pain clinics, their talk-therapies would only be a source of amusement and annoyance to this critical thinker.\n\nYes, the onset was accident related. In 2013 I tripped descending a flight of cement stairs while carrying a case of champagne. No bottles broke, I saved them all!\n\nAm very interested in your use of fentanyl for PLMT. I'm seeing my faithful GP on Dec 7, and will ask him to prescribe it for me, in place of the Tramadol--can you share your dosage , means of administration and frequency with me? I currently weigh 185 pounds (6'1\" male age 73, retired college instructor, nonsmoker), and am comfortable with self-administered IV, IM or subcutaneous injection, if that is what is needed.\n\nThanks again for being there.\n\nMikeY\n1\nReply\nmshka1967\nover 2 years ago\nHi Yes Mikey,\nI know what you mean about the pain program. That is why I was in tears yesterday....Well Fentanyl is prescribed as a patch which you wear on your skin. It is slowly absorbed by the body (transdermally) at a rate of 12, 25, 50, 75 or 100micrograms. You don't get it im or iv. The patch is changed every 3 days. i find it very hard to keep on ithout tegaderm or a waterproof bandaid on top. I feel no different in the head with it which is good (but I'm the same with all the opioids I have tried) but the fact its so hard to keep on is definitely a minus for me. I took 3 that had come off back and 2 others that I hadnt opened. Just to let you know I did, also, try extended release morphine and I ended up taking the whole bottle back as it did nothing for my leg. As for the fentanyl, I am on 25micrograms and I am 120lb and 5' 6\". It is sort of strange to see your foot still moving and have little pain with the movement (most of the time) but I still get breakthrough pain flares, especially If I go without the 600mg of lyrica (pregabalin), Personally I think that the lyrica is imperative for my treatment.\n\nI cant believe that guy wouldn't see you! Its fascinating you had a fall too. The neurologist sort of believes that neuroleptics may have caused mine but I believe that it started happening after I fell and hit my butt and tore my hamstring. The thing was that I stopped my medication suddenly around the same time and I have a clenching jaw with it too - very painful when I clench down extra hard or for a long time. I think that I mainly clench or grind when the pain is so bad though.\nWell good luck when you see your neurologist. I'll also let you know how the bruprinorphine goes too. Be careful with that fentanyl.\nAll the best, mshka.\nReply\nmikey44\nover 2 years ago\nMshka, I took your medication recipe to my faithful GP today. He was interested in your report that Lyrica helped with PLMT, so wrote me a scrip for 76-- 25 microgram caps, 3 +weeks supply. They will only cost me $11.50, thanks to the Canadian profit-restrictions on Pharma.\n\nNot so lucky with Fentanyl--he does not want to get me \"hooked\" (his word!) on a powerful opioid, so we will wait to see how I do on Lyrica.\n\nI understand his caution, since a lyrica+fentanyl cocktail is an undocumented polytherapy in Canada.\n\nDo you feel that you are \"addicted\" to fentanyl---how long have you been taking it?\n\nI'm enjoying an \"indian summer\" here in Vancouver--lovely mountain view from my favorite chair--\n\nbest wishes\nMikeY\n1\nReply\nmshka1967\nover 2 years ago\nHi Mikey,\nThat's great that your GP put you on lyrics. He will gradually work up on the dose. I am currently on 450mg day but I was on 600 mg day for 2 years until the health insurance here made cutbacks. Luckily I am on the government programming as I have no assets and very low income. But that's the insurance that cuts back a lot. I understand your GP's concern about Fentanyl. It can be extremely addictive. People can misuse it in very small amounts and die. Fentanyl is approximatyly 100 times more powerful than heroin and in PA alone, is the leading cause of drug related overdose deaths. In 2016 it contributed to over 50 percent of deaths and 2017 is soaring. I am lucky in the fact that I have never felt 'hooked' to any of my prescription drugs including clonazepam, oxycodone, and Fentanyl. However, as I said I get frustrated with the patch not sticking well and it wastes a lot of medicine even if you try and stick it back on with other waterproof bandaids. Also, I want to do some aquatherapy so it's going to make it more difficult. Thud, we decided to switch to bruprenorphine ( upcoming this Thursday) My psychiatrist explained well what CAN happen though in some people. As you probably know patients on opioids can get used to the dose they are on, and then need a higher dose, then they get used to that dose and it goes on and on. They develop physical and psychological dependence on increasing doses. The other problem is that increased doses of opioids can cause people to want to stay in bed all day, and social isolation among many other things. When you are in bed a lot you decline physically, lose muscle mass and eventually don't get up to do something about your situation. I am additionally lucky in the fact that I haven't needed my doses to ever go up. I am usually over (have some left) on pills or patches at the end of the month. My pain management doctor said there are usually 2 categories of patients that people fall under. He didn't want to go into detail about them but he said I am in the category that won't 'get 'hooked'. He is actually the person that overseas all the monitoring in the state and does research on all this stuff as well. Oh well long story huh? Sorry about that. I hope that lyrics helps you. For me it was a miracle drug. I was hoping the Fentanyl would help my hamstrings and ischium and since it doesn't I'm happy to move on. I'll keep you updated. Oh I wanted to tell you one thing that really helped spasms. It's was carispodal. I had it a few times when this first started happening to me. initially I just went to a medexpress and was never at a pain center. But as you know, the spasms suddenly started causing a lot of pain and these circling toes. due to being put on oxycodone (not with Fentanyl!) I was referred to the pain Center and had to sign a contract so I can't get carispodal from another physician and they are unwilling to prescribe it at the pain Center. So that is all about meds. Try the lyrica first. Good luck. I really hope it helps you.\nAs far as weather we have been so lucky. Suddenly it has turned very cold and our hightoday will be about -0.6 Celsius. I am extremely cold as we could not afford the gas bill and it is shut off. So I am, unfortunately not in a nice chair enjoying an Indian summer- I am under the electric blanket enjoying a good book!\nAll the best! Take good care\nReply\nmshka1967\nover 2 years ago\nOh by the way, its been about 6 months on Fentanyl.\nLyrica is amazing so hopefully the dosing schedule will eventually help you when you find the place where it decreases all that awful neuropathic pain. It really helps with the toes movement too!\nBest wishes and good luck!\nReply\nmikey44\nover 2 years ago\nSo far (only 3 days!) Lyrica has only made me a bit dizzy--no effect on the pain so far, I'll keep increasing dosage for the next 2 weeks, as my doc has ordered. Without the Tramadol, my pain is very intense just now--gritting my teeth to prevent screaming. The foot amputation is looking pretty good again---\nSorry to hear that you cannot afford heat! I'm fairly well off, can I help?\nmike\nReply\nmshka1967\nover 2 years ago\nDear Mikey,\nI am so sorry to hear that you are going through this. Your doctors seem to remove one therapy when trying another. Why dont they try adjunct therapy? Lyrica does make you feel a bit dizzy at first and may take some time to kick in, but I have botox treatment (100 units) with injections in my toes, foot and up my leg with it plus antispasmodics and pain killers. if it is not working keep it up and add the tramadol. Do you think you should come to Pittsburgh? I can ask my neurologist to try and fit you in and see how much it would cost? You would see them every 3 months. I can meet you and support you. I can message him now through myupmc. You can even have my appointment if you want. It is Wednesday, February 07, 2018 at 8:00 am. Thats a long way off because I just had my treatment, and you can build antibodies if done too soon. But he might be able to get you in SOONER! Do you want me to try? He apparently has another patient too and is interested in this condition. I would have to wait again for another appointment, but I am better off than you. No one seems to know how to treat it there in Canada. Please let me know.\nOh gosh I feel for you. I wish I could do something for you. But I have nothing to give but my support\nYou are so sweet and awesome with your last comment. Thank you so, so much from the bottom of my heart. I really cannot believe someone could be so kind! I have so much to address right now, housing being the first. I have $7 to my name. I'm trying to find work again. But I could never ask for money from anyone.\nI have never met you yet I feel like I have known you so long.

The onset was 2016 so I have had this for roughly 4 years non-stop spasmodic clenching and twitching of my right toes and now muscles that I did not know existed in my right foot and also moving upward. I am beginning the same thing on my left foot but this is just beginning. The pain is not in my foot yet, but it goes up my shin. The twitching is literally non-stop.\n\nI am not athletic, however, I try to walk about 2-3 miles a day and I swim when I can. I linked this to some trauma by slipping on the stairs and as I fell, hit the bottom of my feet on the trends; however doctors do not see that this is the cause and possibly not, however, each of you has experienced trauma as well. All I know is that the constant movement of my toes and feet is disturbing and annoying. I could live with the constant moving; however it is the pain in my shin area, under my knee, and now going into my hip that is the worse.\n\nI have been prescribed Ropinirole which caused extreme sleepiness and atrial fibrillation, which is an ongoing issue for me and therefore, discontinued the medication. I have found some relief using Gabapentin for the pain in my legs, but this is not fool-proof. Every night I also have to rub my legs using something I found at Tractor Supply (Willow Balm and $10) and together with Gabapentin, this works most of the time. When it does not I need to take a Vicodin, which I now have a reasonable amount handy just for this use.\n\nHonestly, I thought I was going coo-coo until I read about other people having the same thing, as well as here, and as well as reading the research on this syndrome. Not very assuring; however it is good to know that I also am not alone.\n\nA very good neurologist at the Leahy Clinic diagnosed me in Peabody, MA. He agreed to the Vicodin and what I was doing to help with the leg pain. I would think that any doctor who understood this syndrome would be OK with pain medication, because honestly without this back-up, I would go berserk.\n\nI also had doctors who thought I was an interesting case, however, I insisted that my primary care physician find me a very good doctor in the Boston, MA area to find out what taking place (I had had MRIs, x-rays, and so forth). She did and he was fabulous taking time to really listen to me. He believed me (which was what I needed to know) and that I needed pain medication as a backup and I think he did because I was doing other preventatives. Most of all I wanted to make sure I was not going to die from it; however, this is progressing and I shudder to think of it moving into my arms, which apparently, it can do.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/30591/painful-leg-moving-toes-syndrome-plmt"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"ACTH Stim test- I have abnormal test results, anyone relate?

I am new here and have read every single thing that’s out there regarding Addison’s disease and I am hoping someone can help interpret my ACTH 60 min stimulation test. Everything I read doesn’t compare my abnormal result and can’t find much on my type of results... which may be abnormal??? The stress of waiting to find out if I have Addison’s is making me feel even worse. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 2 years ago but am not convinced that is what’s wrong with me- and have every rare disorder and diagnosis possible- I see an endocrinologist because I have a small cyst on my pituitary. I also was diagnosed with PCOS from him and I have whacky hormone levels such as testosterone, prolactin and estrogen etc. I have very low blood pressure that gets even lower after I eat. I suffer every single day to get up off the couch or out of bed. I am always extremely fatigued- blamed on my fibromyalgia by my PCP. My blood pressure is symptomatic and is around 90/50 on a regular average lately. It’s usually more like 105/69 on average - which is still low. I have never been treated for my low BO and my PCP keeps telling me it’s fine- IT’S NOT FINE! On top of my fatigue, low blood pressure and overall feeling of being unwell for almost two years, I have many other symptoms. But what I would like to know is if these ACTH test results mean I have Addison’s or anything that could answer why I am so sick. I’ve had abdominal and lower back pain accompanied by Naseau, lightheaded and dizziness for months. Here are my ACTH test results: please can anyone interpret them... my cortisol levels do rise a little bit but didn’t reach the post stimulation standard of atleast 18..\ncortisol baseline: 6.4\n30 min: 11.7\n60 min: 14.3\n\nPrior to this I did a simple cortisol am blood test that was borderline and result was 5.2.. so that’s why we did the ACTH test. I also did an MRI of my pituitary (routine to follow its growth) and my endocrinologist said it was fine and that it didn’t cause any of my symptoms. He didn’t want to give me the ACTH but I demanded answers or more tests because I was so sickly feeling and I know somethings wrong with me. He told me he didn’t expect to have adrenal insufficiency but he ordered the test I think to *** me up! I think my results prove that I was right and he was wrong.. I may be wrong here but please someone tell me the answer to these results. I can’t find anyone that had a cortisol level under 18 after peak/post stimulation while at the same time they still doubled their level from base to end like mine.

And even while working in that office I suffered an early miscarriage - to be fair, I don't have a clue if mold had anything to do with that but I definitely do wonder because the doctor couldn't tell me what caused it.\n\nI've been out of that environment since the middle of May 2017 but still experiencing symptoms (brain fog, memory loss, other cognitive issues, digestive problems, random dizziness, severe fatigue, passing out multiple times, etc.) and for the past several months I've had pretty strange menstrual irregularities, such as being late (like a week late) every month for several months, periods only lasting 2 days, bleeding between periods, etc. I'm not pregnant so that isn't the cause and just last week I was told that I have several ovarian cysts on both of my ovaries. Does anyone know if prolonged exposure to both of those molds could have caused these menstrual irregularities and the cysts? Aside from migraines with aura I get once a year, I was completely healthy before I worked in that office, never had issues with my reproductive system, memory, fatigue, nothing! And at most I got sick once or twice a year but while I was there I was sick like every 2 or 3 weeks!! Also, before working there I never had allergies before in my life but while I was in that office I developed horrible allergy issues. Thankfully those have pretty much gone away since leaving that office. Anyway, if anyone knows if prolonged toxic mold exposure can cause reproductive issues like I'm experiencing or knows a direction to point me in please let me know.

Leaving me feeling like wow! how long have I really been gone for?!? Since then, I have been able to obtain 300mg of lamictal upon request. 200mg left me feeling like there was still something missing and that if epileptic people where allowed 400mg, could I request 300mg. My doctor provided me 300mg( 100mg more than the bipolar range of treatment) but would not allow me to have epidiolex a cbd based medication. From ages 19 till 23 I smoked sativa pot a lot! This helped self-medicate. But the psychosis from the thc would get really bad at times. Eventually, pot became legal and a friend recommend pure CBD oil that was not THC at all! I took some pure CBD oil and it felt like I added 50mg-100mg of lamictal to my prescription list almost as if the I up'd my dose with the CBD oil. SInce, the product was legal I try'ed some for about a week and fell in love with the benefits. It was the second time I felt so incredible. The first time being initially prescribed the lamictal back in October 15th of 2018. And the second time obtaining CBD oil from MYNT this October 2019. The combination seemed to cure everything completely. Although I want my insurance to cover the CBD oil bill.. since it is treating my illness... although my doctor wont prescribe me the dose and this makes my own dosing( if I continue and this is safe) uncontrolled.\n\nI consulted my psychartist about the therapuetic benefits of both lamictal and CBD oil. I argued that they both point towards epilepsy based solely on the therapuetic benefits. Although, his agruement was that I have bipolar and the fact that anticolvuslants work for my illness is unrelated to the fact that they work for epilepsy. Then I argued that the theurapuetic benefits were great. He responded that he would not prescribe epidiolex on the basis that it is not needed and would not treat my illness.\n\nMy question is how do I approach MY medication and this condition. Do I try to obtain more information? What kind of information can I gather? Is this completely safe for my liver and neuro processes? Do I need to be diagnosisd epileptic instead of bipolar? Do other bipolar patients every experience a seizure in their life? Wouldn't atleast on seizure contribute to acute or minor seizure relation between bipolar and epilepsy?\n\nMy goal is to either obtain 400mg of lamictal or 300mg of lamictal and some low controlled form of CBD, or 400mg lamictal and some low controlled form of CBD( if this is safe).\n\nIn addition, I have a very very healthly life style.\n\nI bike to and from school.\nI drink tons of water.\nI weightlift and practice martial arts.\nI drink protein (about 50 grams a day with milk blended)\nI drink BCAA's with that protein daily.\nI take multivitamins.\nI take natural supplement called tumeric daily as well.\n\nI am concerned with\nBrain health\nMelanin\nSteven Jonshons disease 0.04% chance of anyone taking lamictal can contract.\nLiver health\nHeart health\n\nAny advice, recommendations, research articles, personal experiences, and general discussions would be great.","like_count":"0","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/103552/medication-discussion-epileptic-help"},{"post":{"author":"joseph06","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Feeling of fluid running down the inside of my skull.","post_content":"Hi, this problem for me started yesterday, and I am scared to death what it could be.

While the operation was successful, it left her with a hemiparesis on the LEFT side. She was also in a coma for about two days after the intervention. The nasty bugger was apparently massive and had left to a hemmorhage which had done some major damage to the pituitary gland and reached the hypothalamus. The epicrisis mentioned about 90% of the tumor having been removed.\n\nPost-operation, we've done several MRI scans since then, showing no residual mass in the location with no new signs of a tumor reappearing. We're constantly doing rehabilitation, so she is now able to walk (with our support, still losing balance when in open spaces) and perform various exercises with her hand! :) (still can't preform daily activities - long road ahead there!)\n\nFor medication - she is prescribed Dehydrocortison (5mg tablets, 1 in the morning and 1/2 before bed) and Nootropil (1200mg, twice a day - contains Piracetam). For the first few months, she was also prescribed Citicoline, but has now stopped taking it. I'm not mentioning other minor minerals, vitamins and eating supplements, but can do if need be.\n\nHowever, there are a few things worrying us as far as her current state goes, so I'd like to tell you about them here in the hope of some suggestions and opinions, in case there is something we should be worrying about...\n\n1) Vision: The RIGHT (not left!) side of her face remains somewhat numb, and her right eye can barely move in all four directions. Opening and closing of the eyelid is fine. She says she feels her ride side as if being \"extruded outwards\". This leads to a weird vision resulting in difficulty of spacial awareness, especially in open spaces outside - leading to a lack of perfect balance. One night I tested her trigeminal nerve sensitivity (temple, cheek and lower edge of the mouth) - all three locations had low sensation, lowest towards the mouth. Maybe some nerves are still constricted? She was prescribed some glasses in accordance to her state, but are there any additional things we can do? We've been told to \"wait\" and that things will slowly get better...\n\n2) Eating is very difficult. She went from eating pureed foods to regular, firmer foods, but she can't really chew properly - cheek, lips and tongue on the RIGHT side are still mostly numb, so managing food with her tongue inside her mouth is tricky. She only eats on the left side, but food tends to drip sometimes and after a few bites her entire mouth goes stiff. We were recommended injections of botulinum toxin in specific parts of the right side, because she has a hyperactive muscle which apparently needs to be relaxed. We had an \"expert\" perform the manipulation three months ago - there were no improvements... Currently, we are looking to contact another specialist in Slovenia for a second attempt, this time with different injection locations. Apart from botox, is there anything else that might relax her face and allow for easier eating? Medication suggestions are welcome, or even special types of exercises.\n\n3) Walking has progressed a lot, but she still has a major issue when it comes to gait and stance due to her left ankle twisting. Very often, the ankle goes stiff and slowly twists inwards, not allowing her to step with her entire foot on the ground. We were told her gastrocnemius muscle is hyperactive and constrictions are leading to this unwanted twist of the ankle. Some days stepping is fine, others it's a nightmare and her entire gait/walking is outright wrong. We noticed that shock occasions, such as a car passing by close or having to cross a street immediately twist her ankle. We are performing electric stimulations, in addition to lots of massages, stretches and exercises. She is now squatting and has proper strength in the leg, but due to this ankle problem walking is very difficult... Are there any other methods we might apply to improve this? Apart from the gastrocnemius muscle bit, it seems her brain is still heavily susceptible to stress and the commands she is getting are forcing this constriction...\n\nLastly, I should mention that multiple blood tests in recent months showed increased levels of calcium and B12 in her bloodstream. We have an upcoming SPECT scan of here parathyroid glands in a few days, to see if a tumor might be causing this. We were told she should drink lots of water...\n\nSo, that's that. Sorry for the wall of text! I can provide additional information if needed, like more detailed breakdown of medication regimes, MRI scan reports and so on. Any suggestions are welcome - mainly for the mouth, as eating difficulties are currently the main factor for depression and whatnot...

Losing Grip Of Reality!","post_content":"Hello ~\n\nMy name is, Cody. I am 30 y.o. I am currently going through something that I have never experienced within my lifetime before. Like, EVER! It is a seriously scary feeling, and I do not know what to do.\n\nTo explain,........\n\nOne evening (around 3 A.M.), I was laying in my bed watching comedy videos on my cellphone (YouTube). Then, unexpectedly, I instantly shot out of bed and began pacing back and fourth within my living room. My boyfriend woke up and asked me, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nI replied, \"I do not know!? I feel very terrified and scared!\"\n\nI began having racing, scary thoughts. For example, I felt as if I had a brain aneurysm and was going to die. Also, I felt as if I was losing grip of reality. The feeling was like, I was becoming \"too aware\" (if that makes sense?)\n\nThus, I instantly began cooking breakfast to take my mind off of these things. Then, when the time came (9 - 11 A.M.), I went to the E.R.\n\n*DISCLAIMER*\n\n(I do not drink alcohol, and I have never done any drugs within my lifetime AT ALL! The only bad habit I have is smoking tobacco/cigarettes. That is it!)\n\nWhile at the E.R., I explained to the Physician that I could not go to sleep due to having these thoughts. They insisted that I take Attarax (itching cream) for this issue...... Anyway, this obviously did not work for me. As the days went by, I found that this situation was becoming worse by the day. Thus, I returned to the E.R.\n\nAfter my second visit, they insisted that I take 1 Xanax and a Benedryl. I was completely scared because, remember, I DO NOT TAKE DRUGS! Yet, the Physician put my mind at ease and told me that it would definitely help me. I took the medication(s), and I discovered that it really helped me. I found that I went to sleep that night with ease and I awoke in a pretty good condition.\n\nYet, after a few days the same thoughts and feeling(s) had returned to me. I was continuing to pace back and fourth, and the feeling/thought(s) of me dieing had returned (I.E.: Brain Aneurysm, Losing grip of reality, Becoming too aware, etc.)\n\nThus, I made a third visit to the E.R. They advised me to go to a Behavioral Health Center in my location, and they informed me that I could get better help there. In this case, they were so wrong.....\n\nWhile there, they prescribed me Zoloft and Trintellix. They also informed me that, what I was going through is \"Anxiety/Panic Disorder.\" They explained to me that, I also \"might be\" depressive. Thus, this is what the Zoloft and Trintellix would help to get rid of.....\n\nOr, so they thought......\n\nAfter a week of being on these medications, I awoke one day and I felt \"SUICIDAL!!!!!\" I have NEVER, and I mean NEVER!! in my life felt suicidal at all! I instantly informed them of this and they immediately pulled me off of these medications.\n\nFinally, I received a family Physician and began seeing him for treatment. He informed me that, I do indeed have anxiety/panic disorder. Thus, he placed me on what I am currently on today.\n\nBuspirone 10 MG\nTrazodone 50 MG\nTrazodone 100 MG\n\nYet, I feel these medications are not working. I do feel as if they have subdued the thoughts a little bit, but they are still there lingering. I have constantly asked for a CT-Scan, yet to no avail.\n\nMy question is, \"what is this that I am going through!?!?\" How is it that, I can be normal one minute to all of a sudden being having these thoughts and feelings? I constantly feel that, at any moment I am going to die and/or lose my mind. I have been begging for help, yet it seems as if no one is listening to me or hearing me. Please, help me. I pray to God that, this feeling goes away. I just want to go back to how I used to be. Please, if any Physicians out there can save my life and/or help me please respond.","like_count":"1","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures","Parkinson's Disease","Alzheimer's Disease","Caregiving"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Chris","resp_time":"5 months ago","resp_title":"RE: I Feel Like I'm Going To Die, And/Or Lose My Mind!

Now I find that certain medications can trigger it or if I am under a lot of stress for any reason.\nAnti-depressants can keep it under control (I live a reasonable normal life now). However, you have to find the one that works for you. My son also has the disorder and had to be put on anti-depressants at the young age of 6 because I recognized it and took him to a child psychiatrist. Zoloft worked for him for many years, but stopped working when he was a teenager and they switched him to Prozac. Paxil was and still is a life-saver for me.\nHang in there and keep trying to get a doctor to work with you to get you on the right medication that will help.

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant).\nCan anyone help me with a diagnosis and treatment?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/94790/help-diagnose"},{"post":{"author":"johnlh","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Essential Tremor","post_content":"My understanding of this disease it is inheirted.

Read this.","post_content":"I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply \"disappear\" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.\n\nFirst things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.\n\nMy two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.\n\nDuring about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?!\n\nBefore I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.\n\nOK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!)\n\nSo anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.\n\nI want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place.\n\nGood luck!\nDC\n\nOther symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching:\n\nLong lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)\n\nShorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"facelesss","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Numbness, muscle twitching, and no diagnosis?

I've been on a preventative, Topiramate, for many years, though the side effects are very difficult to live with. Fortunately the new drug, Aimovig was approved by my insurance, and the drug company that makes it, has a 1 year program that lowers the copay, so I am now trying that drug with great success. That is allowing me to lower my Topiramate gradually. I'm not sure what I will do when my 1 year is up, as this drug is too expensive to take without financial help. The Rx drug Imitrex was helpful, yet it too brought side effects. I'd say what has helped me most was my neurologist, who I've seen for 10 years, and will fight my insurance for what he knows is best for me. I'd suggest first getting on board with a specialist, and then going further, as 10 years is far too long to suffer with such a debilitating condition!

I have found many possibilities but am so tired of doctors I am just enduring for now. It might be stress.\n\nHowever, reading your information, I am struck by your mentioning the vein enlarging and blood seeming to flow faster. I urge you to see a doctor. Headaches like you are experiencing need to be evaluated by a neurologist. It sounds scary, but you might just find your cure. Today they have non-invasive radiology procedures that can be used with far less risk and better outcomes than actual brain surgery. It very well might be vascular in nature. Apparently, most headaches unrelated to an obvious illness, are caused by the vessels in our brains. Sometimes it is simple and temporary. I don't think you fall in that category.\n\nWhat is exciting, there are several cerebral, vascular problems that can be completely reversed. Untreated, they can become very dangerous.

I decided to post this to see if anyone has any experience with this odd medical situation I’ve been having for the last week.\n\nBefore I go into further detail I just want to preface by saying that I do have a doctors appointment set up next week because I know most of the responses below are probably going to consist of recommendations to make a doctors appointment to get a proper diagnosis, which is completely understandable.\n\nSo about a couple weekends ago a buddy of mine gave me a homemade cannabis edible. It was just a gross tasting little glob about the size of a tic tac. I’m not really into taking any sort of illegal drugs but didn’t see any harm in taking it at the time. Where I believe I may have gone wrong, or at least amplified the problem, was the fact that I had already had a few drinks that night. Anyway, to make a long story short, after about an hour or so of feeling some slight euphoria, things started to take a turn for the worse. I started feeling very weak and my motor movements seemed to really be affected. My movements all seemed to be very ridged and not smooth. I also started noticing that my muscles were shaking when I would engage them. For example, touching my thumb to my index finger would cause those fingers to shake noticeably. When laying down in bed and relaxing my muscles, they wouldn’t shake but after laying down for a minute I noticed my whole body start to have this rhythmic rocking to it. Like someone sitting in a rocking chair, just to a much lesser extent. I really just felt awful and I wish I had never taken that thing and couldn’t wait for it to all be over.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the next day and thankfully I don’t feel like death anymore but I notice that I still have these symptoms, just to a lesser degree. I still felt weak and just not quite like myself. I can still feel my muscles vibrate and shake when doing certain actions. I figured I probably need more time in order to recover from whatever it is that’s causing these symptoms.\n\nFast forward another couple weeks to today, and I still don’t feel back to normal. I still feel slightly week. And the muscle shaking, although much better than that night, is still there. When I touch my thumb to my index finger at certain times and positions, I can get them to still lightly shake. If I lift my leg up, it’s a smooth motion, when I lower it back down I can feel my core shake slightly. Same goes for lifting my arm and lowering my arm as well. I have noticed that drinking caffeine (which I have always done) does amplify the effects I just described. I have also noticed that adrenaline does amplify the effects as well, such as being in a confrontation.\n\nI am a very active person. I weight train along with run 4-5 days a week. I’ve also noticed the more noticeable shaking while l weight train, and after a hard workout or a long run when I normally feel weak, the symptoms are worse then too. I’m racking my brain to try to think of things I might be doing currently that could either be contributing to this or possibly preventing me from fully recovering. Am I running too much? Am I not eating enough calories? Am I stressing too much? Should I change my diet? Should I stop my medication? (Zoloft). Am I vitamin deficient? I have no idea, especially since this all seemed to just appear out of nowhere after that incident I described.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have seen a number of posts from people that describe similar things to what I’m describing without really seeing what their outcome is. I remember back maybe 12 years ago, I had similar symptoms that seemed to come out of nowhere. I went to the doctors. They did blood tests. Numerological tests, ect. All came back normal and the doctors pretty much shrugged their shoulders and had no idea. And I believe the symptoms just completely disappeared maybe a few weeks later and have felt completely normal.\n\nI appreciate the time to read over my post and if anyone has any sort of suggestions or questions about what might be going on if anyone has had similar symptoms and what they’ve done about it. I’m going to see my doctor this Saturday and I can provide an update once I do but I’m thinking it’s just going to be another waste of time and shoulder shrugging.\n\nThanks!!","like_count":"2","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"lupy1","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Minor tremors and Ridgid muscle movements","resp_content":"I know someone that had a really bad experience with this stuff Maybe it's some ingredient or some medication they take, but she is still not over it.

I've been looking into seizure types and I don't quite fit the definitions. I am not currently diagnosed with anything more than asthma. When I was born, I was premature and had jaundice. No other complications known. I show symptoms of a dissociative disorder, AD(H)D and/or autism, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME). I have undocumented CPTSD and only have panic responses (no OCD or habits gained). I am underweight.\n\nHere's what weirdness I get:\n- Random 'neck bounces': I'll just start bouncing my neck up and down (like those videos of birds bouncing to dace to music), quite rapidly but only small movements. It rarely disrupts my ability to think and I'm always conscious. Usually only when I'm seated, but does happen when I'm stood up too. Never when I'm laying down\n- Limb bouncing: usually my arms, with the \"bounce\" originating at my wrists, or my legs with the bounce originating at my knees/thighs/hips. This sensation feels like my brain says to my body \"need to stretch legs\", but my body bounces instead of just stretching. I'm able to \"interrupt\" it, but I usually still have the \"need\" to stretch. Usually happens while sat down, sometimes while laying, rarely while standing.\n- 'Body lockup': my whole entire body just stops. I feel my eyes go vacant. Sometimes my head will drop forwards a little (only by an inch or so) and will sometimes also either tilt to the left, OR my face will drop so I'm facing left. I can still move my eyes, and when my head drops, I will continue looking at the \"normal\" eyeline, meaning I end up looking annoyed as sometimes my brow furrows slightly. My arms relax. My hands \"reset to a default position\", sometimes they feel like I have rigid gloves on, making them unable to move until I recover. Sometimes my wrists will curl in, towards my torso. I cannot move much until I forcefully regain control by remaining calm and thinking about moving. It presents like a complex partial seizure but I am completely fully aware. It feels like I'm trapped in my own body. Often afterwards I am tried or grouchy. Sometimes I get fuzzy on what happened about 5-10 minutes after the episode. Rarely, it feels like what happened before the episode was \"a day ago\", that everything that happened after is \"today\", and I forget almost everything that I was previously aware of. I think this has only happened when I've been seated. I can sometimes feel it coming on, especially if I'm stood up, but I don't really recognise it until after. When it \"comes on\" while I'm standing, I can brute-force my way out of having an episode by just maintaining action (eg: thinking about moving, the same strategy I use to break out of it). If I'm walking and its particularly bad, I will come to a stop, but this is actually jarring enough for my brain to \"snap out of it\".\n- Arms randomly curling up. I hate to be that person, but you know how some people with disorders like cerebral palsy have their arms contorted weirdly, often curled up on their chest? Sometimes I do that. I just bring my arms up and in, and my hands do the sort of hand position you make when giving someone a piece of paper (thumb angled in slightly, fingers curled around it and the base of it...) while touching the backs of my hands together. As with the leg/arm bouncing, it feels like a stretch, and I can \"interrupt\" it but I still feel like I need to do it. Happens when standing or sitting. Might happen when laying?\n- Slapping/smooshing my hands together. Not sure how to explain this one. It's a bit weird. Imagine laying on your arms until they're numb, then try to clap. Happens when sat down or standing/walking. Don't think this happens when I'm laying down.\n\nI know that these symptoms might read as autistic/AD(H)D stimming, or dissociative behaviour, but I can tell you this: The sensations inside my body and inside my head are so much different. I'm certain that these aren't caused by the things I already listed.\n\nMy questions are:\n1) Does anyone know what I might be facing?\n2) How do I bring these up to my doctor? Every way I plan it feels... Weird.\n\nAny help appreciated.\nThanks.","like_count":"0","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/67162/involuntary-body-movements-while-conscious"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Involuntary movements","post_content":"Here it goes:\n\nI'm a 24 female with historic of chorionic tonsillitis but had my tonsils removed at age 17.\nOn April I started having heart palpitations randomly so I went to the ER, general doctor there asked for an ECG which come back normal so he prescribed me Xanax 0,5mg/ once a day for 5 days, after 10 days the palpitations stoped.

I just never had so much hair loss before)\nI noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too\nMy heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.\nShowed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.\nIt takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.\nSince this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something \"flow\" on my peripheral vision but bothers me. It's like I can catch any movement or light and it is just a weird perception and I see even small particles floating on the air.\nSumming up my symptoms are:\n1- heart murmur I-II and palpitations ( tachycardia and sinus breathing arritmia)\n2- hair loss (brittle very thin hair)\n3- eye discomfort and weird vision\n4- neck stiffness and neck pain\n5- neck lymph nodes enlarged and thyroid nodules\n6- weight loss and apetite loss\n7- increase on bowel movements\n8- menstrual cycle alterations\n9- jerky involuntary movements and muscle spasms\n\nIf anybody has any idea what this can be or what other tests I should do please help me out.\nI'm so young.","like_count":"1","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures","Parkinson's Disease","Alzheimer's Disease","Caregiving"]},"responses":[{"author":"lee333","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Involuntary movements","resp_content":"I know how these days if they can't find anything then it's got to be fibromyalgia\nBut I get my fibromyalgia from family members way down the family tree and my Grandma and her son which is my father had it to I'm not sure why but it hits very hard.

I had memory issues, falling and sometimes speech problems. In 2014 was diagnosed with elevated ammonia levels, seizures and post encephalitis. I have been falling very frequently. In fact l just fell in my doctors office 2 1/2 weeks ago and l was recovering from a fractured leg which is not the first time. My first neurologist after my first TBI said l had partial seizures, the next carpal tunnel and Parkinson's disease. And my last one non epileptic seizures and conversion disorder. Now l.have fallen so many times it unreal and lots of places. My hands trembling, slurred speech, balance issues. Sometimes have one of my family member to help me go to the restroom. I finally got tired of my doctors because you are trying to tell them something is wrong and they come back with psychotic, bipolar and schizophrenia. And l been to rehab constantly in patient and outpatient. Matter fact l am going now. I had so many surgeries from falling it should tell the doctors something. I have autoimmune disease. One is encephalopathy because of my liver. And l was told before after my biopsy l didn't have cirrhosis and after this last hospital admission on my records it say l do but the doctor said everything was okay. So when l did my research l have the same symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis, when l went to the mayo clinic they said possible because l wasn't showing signs at that time. But their only 2 doctors there that specializes in it. But l definitely have autoimmune encephalopathy. I take lactulose for that. Then my neurologist that l stop seeing since l went to the hospital he works in when l was admitted l had to see him because he was the last one l saw. Now when l fell in the doctors office l hit my mouth and it was bleeding. And l thought it might have been my ammonia levels since it's been high for the last 3months and it was high 3 days before l fell. Now l had to have help for 2 days to get out vfc the bed to go to the bathroom. I remember one evening the nurse said she was giving me my keppra by lV. As soon as she gave it to me l felt a burning but l thought it was running to fast but it wou lm d be okay. Well it wasn't so.l tried to ring the call light to get help and l drop the hand control because my hands were temor so l tried to hit the call light on the bed but l couldn't. Then l felt my head shaking. The nurse came in and l didn't even know how she knew l was having a problem. Then l just blanked out. Now after all this was over l felt fine. I don't know how long this was going on. The next night it happened again l was told\nI don't know if it was meds or a seizure. Then when it was over l tried to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast but when she saw the text l couldn't understand and she told me she couldn't either. So l called my husband since l couldn't text and that was hard too. I had problems touching the numbers on my cellphone but l didn't give up. When he talked to me he couldn't understand me because he said my speech was slurred and this happens quite often. I don't know it but other people tell me that. So\nI was always asking the nurse about my ammonia levels and they were checked only twice. When l was in er and when l was discharged. Then the neurologist comes in to discharge me and he said everything came back okay. He's crazy he needs to go back to medical school because if you have autoimmune encephalitis they said everything can come back okay even your EEG. I got that from the UK and also the autoimmune encephalitis alliance that's the mayo clinic site and a women wrote a book on it she went through the same thing. They are now taking about it and trying to educate doctors because a lot of people have been diagnosed with mental illness which they said could have possibly had or have it. Now when l was discharged l didn't sign any discharged papers and the nurse gave me no instructions. I showed my text and she told me yes that's one of the symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. So now get my discharged papers and they have on hepatic encephalopathy with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, TIA, fronta lm dengentive disease which was ruled out at the mayo clinic, conversion disorder, non eplipetic seizures, depression and other things but everything was normal. My daughter called the mayo clinic and she told me liver doctor there what was going on. He told her to ask the doctor there to run a test since one of my liber shunts is slightly open snd blood was wasnt flowing. Then he said they might not do it because you have gotten a second opinion and they found something. He was definitely correct on that one. Oh forgot to say twice they gave me aspirin and l been allergic to it since 2005 and it's on all my records and so l got bruises on my legs. So today l am going to see my gp and then in October l go back to the mayo clinic because the doctors here are so blinded about diagnoses at least the ones l have gone to except 3 since 1997- 2018. I have been given meds from the doctors and pharmacy that were recalled. Thank God for wisdom. And l can say for 19yrs with memory problems and lots of prayer l can remember a lot and l am writing my first book about what l went through.","like_count":"1","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/65079/doctors-with-no-idea-of-what-s-going-on"},{"post":{"author":"nashhill","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Continuous twitching of tongue, face and body.

It's amazing that only two people have participated in this discussion, so I thought I would give you some reassurance and hope.\n\nFirst of all, I'm glad that Mexican scam surgeon didn't have a chance at amputating your foot/feet! Amputating my feet as a solution to my problem has been a family joke for some time. However, I would never consider it seriously, though my pain must not be as bad as yours. As a matter of fact, it's usually mild to moderate. It's the constant motion of my toes that's driving me and my family crazy!\n\nMy symptoms started in January or February of this year, but I didn't see a neurologist for it until May. I was put on Lyrica and Gabapentin for a month each without any improvement, so I was referred to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, where I have been seen by Dr. Anhar Hassan, who turned out the top specialist in the world, from what I have seen: she is the co-author of the largest-case study on PLMT: \"Painful Legs and Moving Toes Syndrome. A 76-Patient Case Series,\" published in August 2012 at \"Arch Neurol/vol. 69 (nr. 8).\n\nSince my main complaint is toe movement, and I think that if that is stopped, the pain will go away, Dr. Hassan is starting me on Ropinirole (Requip) 1 mg a day, gradually increasing the dose. If, after 9 weeks of treatment, I haven't felt any improvement, she'll try another medication.\n\nThis is a very rare condition indeed: Mayo Clinic had only seen 76 cases in 28 years (their study covered 1983 to 2011), and they see an average of 4 cases of PLMT per year. So we are basically guinea pigs, a rare breed. However, I am hopeful that they will find a successful treatment, if not to cure it, at least to lessen the movement and the pain. If you haven't been to Mayo Clinic, I would strongly recommend it to you.\n\nI hope you two are doing better. I'm glad we \"met\".

A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly. The top number goes form 110-180 extremely quickly without any reason and the bottom number usually stays around 80, but yesterday it went to 120 multiple times. I am now always slightly dizzy and lightheaded and I cannot even do something like take the dog for a walk without losing all my color and falling. I have passed out twice after attempting to push myself. I have also gone to the ER twice, urgent care once and attempted to figure out the problem with my new primary care doctor. The ER did an EKG and bloodwork which were fine, though I I was experiencing syncopy, with my pulse at 46-49. My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally.

It would take a long time to discuss my whole story but I'll try to sum it up. About 10 years ago my symptoms began with anxiety, memory issues, blacking out, nausea, vomiting, dizziness. Found out I have POTS, GERD, and IBS. The doctor said the memory issues and blacking out were caused from the anxiety and I tried every medicine available with no success. Sometime within the next year, my hip became numb/tingly/painful. Again, doctors had no clue what it was. Fast forward to now, I learned to cope with symptoms as best as possible and gave up with trying to get help from doctors. At this point, I still have all the same symptoms plus extreme fatigue, often feeling \"in a daze\", neuropathy, twitching, muscle pains/weakness, incontinence, and tremors.

I really don't know what yours sounds like but I'd definitely go see a neurologist if not just to rule out things.\nReply\nmelanie94\nover 1 year ago\njoacparr: I see. I've been investigating on my own on the internet to see if something is similar to what I have and so far I found several things but it'd have to be more than one disease to cause all the symptoms I been having or attribute some of the them to stress. I don't know if I can get my family support going to the neurologist. They think there's nothing wrong with me that this is anxiety. I don't know what to do. I found some mouth sores yesterday so I'm going to the dentist ( passing it as my 6 months standard cleaning). My vision also has been bothering me. I'm still waiting for my anti-thyroid anti-corps analysis to come back in a week. After that I'll see what I'll do. I pray it's thyroids that's causing this imbalance.\nGood luck on your exam\nReply\ncatfurlogic\nover 1 year ago\nSome camps discourage \"reading up\" online but it only makes sense.

Went on to do heart Eco to rule out any heart anomalies, blood tests to rule out infections or other diseases such as anemia, throat and nose checked for bacteria to rule out rheumatic fever, thyroid eco and hormones checked to rule out Graves' disease or other thyroid issues, found bacteria on my throat but the yupe was klebsiella só it couldn't cause any type of heart disease, found thyroid nodules small ones and the thyroid hormones exam came back normal so thyroid couldn't cause that either. So far nothing that could be causing the heart palpitations.

I’m now 4 months in and they are continuing - getting worse and more frequent. I actually know exactly when I had the first one – I was on holidays and departing the hotel and I got this head rush that was very sharp and lasted only a few seconds. It felt like someone stuck a needle in my brain full of adrenaline. I could feel the rush come from behind my right eye and it was so strong I got tingling down my entire body. These “rushes” only last a few seconds and don’t interfere with my balance / motor skills nor do I have any cognitive break etc.… they are just very annoying and generate a bit of anxiety. The rushes are not painful and no noise heard. After that first one, I was experiencing them 4 or 5 times every hour for the next month. For that first month, they generally only occurred when I was in situations that had a bit of anxiety involved – good or bad: i.e. playing a video game and monster jumps out, watching TV and phone rings… initially the sensation was almost pleasurable – almost like a release of sorts. Again, they only last a few seconds and once over, I do get an anxious feeling. Initially, in-between these episodes I felt fine. For the first month I just wrote these off as I must have picked up a bug while on vacation (I was in New York). Few items about me – I have never had any issues with depression or anxiety in the past and take no drugs and am a very moderate drinker.\n\nI began to get worried the second month as the head rushes started to occur every 10 minutes of so regardless of what I was doing – no anxiety needed. These new head rushes are similar to the more anxiety generated rushes just a bit milder. They also last just a few seconds. In the second and third month of this issue, I got as many as 80 of the milder rushes a day. As of right now (four months in), I get the milder rushes up to 160 a day. I swear I can feel a build up to each rush in the minute before they occur. I still get the “sharper” and more anxiety driven rushes as well but 3 or 4 an hour. These rushes also occur at night and the sharper ones will wake me up. I’m off work at the moment and have very little stress in my life.\n\nIn addition to the head rushes, in month 3 and 4 I started experiencing general fatigue and am now sleeping 12 hour a day. I usually run on my treadmill for an hour and now can only manage 20 minutes before I am exhausted and drenched in sweat. One of the worse problems I am now having related to this is I have no sex drive – never had that issue before. I am also putting on weight.\n\nAfter the first month I went to see my Doctor about this – he tested my thyroid and I was a bit low so am now on 50 mg of synthroid. My vitamin B was a bit low as well so am on a B supplement. As my symptoms are so strange and persistent, I had an MRI on my head done to ensure no tumor etc.… The MRI was clean. Doc also suspected Cushing Disease so have done 2 X 24 hour urine cortisol test. In both tests my cortisol was above average. Doc had MRI on my adrenal glands to see if there was a tumor – MRI was clean. Running out of ideas, my GP has now referred me to an Endocrinologist. The Endocrinologist had me do a blood cortisol test – it came up as abnormal but too low cortisol not too high? Endocrinologist now doesn’t think it is cushing or even endocrine issue?\n\nI have searched high and low on the Net for folks with my similar symptoms – closest I can find are for folks with antidepressant withdrawal (SSRI) however, I have never been on antidepressants and am not on any drugs.\n\nAnyways – saw this forum with folks who had similar symptoms and thought I would post in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation looking for answers.","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"headzap","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Help-160+ \"head rushes\" or \"brain zaps\" everyday!","resp_content":"Update - the head rushes continue to get milder and less frequent.

I have had this (and worse) for months and was finally dually diagnosed with Vestibular Neuritis and with having Vestibular Migraines. Vestibular is the nerve running from behind the ear to the brain having to do with balance. When swollen, it is delayed in sending motion impulses to the brain, causing the dizziness or swimming feeling. Simply turning my head or standing up can throw me down. This part was diagnosed only through an MRI. Get one asap. As for the V. Migraines, I have a history of Migraines and these episodes also include horrible headaches so I also saw a Neurologist. I do physical therapy for the first - concentrating on a letter on a wall and slowly moving my head to keep it in focus, literally restarting my brain. For the migraines, we are trying medication.

I saw an ENT two days ago and he told me I didn’t have an ear problem. He said VN goes away very quickly and that it’d be more severe than what I have, such as vertigo, throwing up, and not being able to walk at all. I’ve also read though that VN can take on a viral infection that sticks around for years sometimes. Anyway, I’m going to do the therapy anyway because it can also help with anxiety, so whether it’s anxiety or ear that’s the cause, the physical therapy will help. Because I know that there’s no medicinal cure if it’s the ear.

I wasn't wearing a seat belt, and flew into the dash. It was a very bad crash and a very hard hit. I'm not entirely sure what hit me, but something slammed at full force into my left temple (I'm assuming it had to have been the rear-view mirror). It hurt so bad, I couldn't even touch it, brush my hair, or even open my mouth for almost two weeks (It hurt my temple when I opened my mouth). It gradually improved, and got to where it would just very dully ache every other day or so. Well, as of yesterday, my entire head has been feeling pain in random, spread out places (the place that got hit months back hurting the worst). It isn't an unbearable pain or anything, but it's just worrisome. I also feel a tingling, almost numb sensation all across my head, but very amplified in my temple area. It has almost felt like something is \"moving\" where I got hit a few times over the past two days. I'm also going to clarify that I did not go to the doctor after the wreck, so I'm not 100% sure it was a concussion, but I'm just assuming it was due to how hard of a hit it was. My mom insists I'm okay, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I swam pretty vigorously around 5 days ago (hand stands, flips underwater, lots of playing around with my younger cousins). She said that may could have played a part in it, but of course my anxiety tries to tell me it is something much worse, such as a blood clot or serious brain damage. I've read about Post-Concussion Syndrome, and I'm honestly not sure if this is it (partly because I didn't get the doctor's say that it was a concussion to begin with, but I'm pretty positive myself). I'm mainly just scared that I've developed a blood clot over the past few months due to the impact, and I'm going to have a stroke or something as severe.

I have multiple neurological conditions and have had numerous MRIs. I'm 68 and had Polio in 1954, and have been on Disability since 1999. In fact, I saw my neurologist yesterday and she prescribed two MRIs for next week. It's very interesting that you mention side-effects, because that is something I have experienced. I did have complications once while in the hospital. I was brought downstairs at 3 am and wasn't very aware of what was going on. The radiologist who performed the MRI (I'm not sure if it was for a CAT scan or MRI) asked me if I was allergic to contrast dye. I said I didn't know. At that point the radiologist should NOT have used contrast dye, and only proceeded with the tests that didn't require contrast - per hospital protocol. Or, if it was absolutely necessary to use dye, I was supposed to be closely monitored for any signs of allergic reactions.\n\nSo, I was given contrast dye, and my arm where I got the injection started to swell like a balloon, an obvious sign that I was allergic to the dye. He continued with the MRIs (or CAT scan) with contrast dye anyway, which was extremely dangerous. By the time I was returned to my room I was in anaphylaxis shock, by then my lips and tongue were swelling, and I had trouble breathing. Fortunately, a nurse noticed what was happening and gave me a shot of adrenaline. The swelling went down immediately. And I was okay.\n\nWhat I learned is that the contrast dye is made from shellfish. I knew I was allergic to shellfish, and when the radiologist asked me if I was allergic to contrast dye and I didn't know, he was supposed to ask if I was allergic to shellfish, but he didn't. As for you, I would ask my neurologist and radiologist about any side-effects and to make sure that if you did, they could treat it immediately. I'm not trying to scare you, chances are you'll be fine. I've had many other scans using different contrast dye without any problems.\n\nThe other thing you should know is that the MRI is a huge machine. The older ones were closed, and you're placed inside a tunnel like opening, which scares many people.

Last week I suddenly began experiencing what I believe falls into the category of distal peripheral neuropathy. I am primarily experiencing constant dull pains that appear and vanish sporadically in my feet and hands - not necessarily the joints but more the muscles and areas away from joints. The pain will appear in one spot, last for 30 seconds, then move to a completely different location. Sometimes it appears in 2 to 3 locations at the same time. Pain varies in intensity but probably avgs a 5 out of 10. Occassionally it feels like getting stuck by a pin - ive more than once thought I was getting bit on the feet by fire ants only to discover nothing there.\n\nAdditionally, the pain is sometimes accompanied by mild burning sensations in the same general locations. I am also experiencing dull, achey pain in my knee joints, upper back, and thighs.\n\nI do not have a fever, but I'm not feeling fantastic either. I've been feeling pretty tired over the last few days and sometimes I vaugeley feel as if I'm fighting a virus.\n\nQuestion is - should I seek medical attention for this? Is this type of sudden neuropathy indicative of a serious illness/infection or could I simply be fighting off a normal virus of some type. Never experienced symptoms like this before. What kind of doctor would be best qualified to review my case?

I also felt a strong \"sinking\" feeling, which made me feel like I was going to pass out and also gave me the feeling of a potential seizure.

All indications are that I have an extremely rare (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability.\n\nBefore you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell.\n\nIn my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up.\n\nAnd today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence.\n\nAt this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.\n\nSincerely Yours,\nRobert","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/51960/where-would-i-get-this-exraordinary-ability-tested"},{"post":{"author":"akashsingh123","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"What kind of Growth is in my back of head?","post_content":"Hi Docs, I am a 24 year old, male from India.

The blurring is worse in my right eye and lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to 4-5 hours.\n\nThe blurring first started in November when I had a migraine that was so severe I went to the on base ER (in the military). I had a couple migraines as a kid but nothing for about 7 years prior to the November migraine (haven't had any since November). It started with floaters in my vision and intense pain (way over a 10/10 if that's possible, it was honestly indescribable) and progressed to being unable to walk, confusion, complete blindness, and an inability to speak. I could say garbled words and was aware enough to get really frustrated that I couldn't say what I was thinking. then I just couldn't say anything anymore even though I was thinking clearly to myself.\n\nThey did a CAT, MRI, and subsequent MRIs with Dye traces, all of which they say came back clear.

So let me start by saying im 19and have beem healthy all my life i used to get dizzy spells sometimes at a young age but nothing like how ive been feeling for a while now. About 6 months ago i began have bad heart palpitations and dizzy spells and not being able to drive at certain points because i would have panic attacks and feel like i was going to faint behind the wheel. Following that i was put on betablockers and have been back and fourth to doctors and cardiologists for months doing stress tests, being on heart monitors, echocardiograms and ekgs that all came back normal but i still feel myself getting these irregular and extremely fast heart rates when i sit up or lay down (mostly worse at night) and definitely increase with anxiety. A few months went by and the betablockers seemed to help a little so i just assumed i had terrible anxiety but come this past february i was sitting eating dinner going about my normal day and suddenly i couldnt focus on anything and i felt like i couldn't remember any short term things and i felt weak and i got up went to the bathroom and went and layed down on my bed and suddenly everything went black and the next thing i remember was my mom shaking me and asking me what happend i woke up and was llaying in a pile of blood on my pillow and felt extremely hungover and completely confused as to what happened. My mom didnt see what happened to me because i was in my room but she immediately took me to the hospital and the did many tests including a CT scan an MRI artery valve ultra sounds blood tests and xrays and everything came back normal. Prior to all of this for about a week or two before this \"seizure\"the doctors in the hospital told me i had , i had been experiencing horrible headaches id have to sleep off that would be throughout my whole head with sharp pains and into my ears. My ears also sometimes ring and feel clogged and ache and also i get pins and needles in my finger tips and toes once in a blue moon still to this day and same with the headaches. So from there on out i stayed at the hospital over night where they released me the next day and ordered an eeg test to have done. My neurologist got results back a few days later after they conducted the test for about 15 minutes and he called saying i had temporal lobe epilepsy and he started me on keppra and lamictal twice a day already on topof the beta bockers i already take and birth control i just started. Because i feel like my symptoms are getting worse including the headaches extreme dizziness earaches ,suttle confusion at times and worsened anxiety i went to get a second opinion at a doctor who i thought to be very intelligent and after hearing my symptoms and episodes ive been experiencing for months told me i may not have epilepsy at all considering ive only had the one seizure and no one even saw it happen. So for now im decreasing the amount of epilepsy medications im on and instead of taking two ill be taking one eventually (the lamictal) and hes going to be runing other tests including a second mri to make sure its not something they missed reading it the first time, more blood testing, a table tilt test because he thinks i may have POTS an ansar test and a 24 hour eeg to actually prove of theres abnormalities and any signs of epilepsy. With all of this my current fear day in and day out for on going months upon months now is that i have a brain tumor and its causing me to be extremely stressed and anxious all day and night because im scared i might die and waiting for test results and having follow up appointments woth all of that is making me slowly go insane because im just so scared for my health that i have cancer right now. So if anyones out there that maybe has ever felt the same way or a doctor that can maybe read this and help me or comfort me in anyway till i fet results back it would be highly APPRECIATEd because its making me so terrified all day everyday and its hard for me to focus on work school and relationships and i wish i just had answers thank you for anyone who toom the the time to read this i just want to feel better....:(","like_count":"0","tags":["Epilepsy/Seizures","Caregiving"]},"responses":[{"author":"em1315","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Neurological/ cardio problems","resp_content":"let me add with the supposed seizure my bottom teeth also moved and i bit\nmy tongue thats why they diagnosed it as a seizure.\n"},{"author":"em1315","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Neurological/ cardio problems","resp_content":"also ive beem having blurry/ foggy vision lately more so since i upped in mgs of the lamictal and i dont no if its a side effect of the lamictal or signs of a brain tumor and im just so scared...\n"},{"author":"e38201","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: PLEASE HELP( Neurological/ cardio problems)","resp_content":"I also have temporal lobe seizures (which have been treated with surgery) I had symptoms very similar to yours before I was diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy.

I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset.

She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me.\n\nIn December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it.

What I and others are experiencing around this topic is unrelated and has no correlation to anxiety. Anybody who says it is not going through this, is being hard headed and as well in a hurry to jump to a conclusion. Yes the symptoms include anxiety but it is not the root cause of the problem. Unfortunately when bringing up this topic with most health care \"professionals\" they just write it off as. I first started noticing the effects of this pathogen three years prior, (mid of 2015) as well as remembering controlling the entirety of my body & being completely healthy. So far roughly around every single doctor or neurologist I have went to in my area has assumed I have been incorrect about my hypothesis about my self diagnosis or to go as far and call me delusional. With regard to whether anybody believes me or not is not of my interest but to dispute and to further archive my self diagnosis is my main concern.\n\nThe brain stem is connected directly to the tongue, which is therefor essential for most of the motor functions of the human body. Now to say that if saliva embedded with pathogenic bacteria could make its way from the tongue, to the brain stem, to the peripheral nervous system, to basically spread to parts of the brain could it? The head tremor started when I felt my neck snap in certain places. It was a rather disgusting sound I felt. I feel as though as there are nerves on the back of my neck crawling, running up to my head. At times rising to the sides of my head, extending to my frontal lobe. It is followed by deterioration and tremor of the vision, cognitive impairment, consistent nightmares and other serious issues. I remember scouring the Internet for drugs that could possibly reverse the initial effects of the tremor. I came across Trazodone. I will vouch for this drug 100% My saliva is indeed the root cause of all of this. Within the first initial week of taking the drug my saliva regenerated, became thick again and every single part of my body became free of any sort of tremor.\n\nUnfortunately for me I ended up distorting my sleep schedule which ultimately ended up (no idea how) slimming my saliva back down to this cottony, weak texture. With that brought back the tremor. Saliva in all cases tells how healthy person is. If it is thick and sticky that usually means a person is fine and healthy. If it is vice versa, generally the person is not. I'm certainly most likely experiencing a case of nerodegeneration. To make things worse my family and personal doctor think I am making this up and do not believe me. Adding to the palm to the face I have no money for an MRI or \"decent\" health insurance. I have been reading studies about the drugs Trazodone and Dibenzoyl methane to possibly slow the effects of the spreading disease. Taking the first medication I can say it indeed does but does not eliminate it.\n\nI argue that this was passed orally and is slowly worsening . I am certain it is a pathogenic bacteria but not entirely sure. To reiterate my intention is to archive my findings and possibly to spread awareness. Let me also say there are more people than me going through this. This is a severe issue that I will not label as just anxiety. the image uploaded shows parts of the brain affected. To go into detail, the red areas that I've circled are parallel to the health issues. The vision / eye tremor being caused by infected optical lobe, tremor on the face being caused by the infected facial nerves. ect.... Pretty much my entire body is subjected to it. The bacteria or pathogen is slowly spreading across the brain. Yes I am absolutely terrified. By next year I can be put in a state of dementia and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I can get the help i'm in dire need of.\n\nNo I am not over analyzing my situation. Reason why my personal doctor does not believe me is because he says impossible to be transmitted anything via saliva . I may look normal when you see me but I feel a tremor on my brain stem and twitch constantly. Feelings of depression hit even harder than they used to.I heard phage treatment may be an answer and I am willing to spend the rest of my money on it, but I have no way of knowing how to diagnose myself. I can't get that kind of treatment unless I get a diagnosis that shows what is wrong. A blood test shows my white cell count normal. Unless the location I went to get my testing done did not correctly run my information , to be honest I am lost. I would not be pressing this issue if there wasn't anything wrong with me.","like_count":"1","tags":["Parkinson's Disease","Alzheimer's Disease"]},"responses":[{"author":"lavendergirl711","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: lightning bolt spasms back of the head , followed by tremor, brain fog ect...","resp_content":"Look at Pseudo Cranial Tumor Symptoms or Increased inner cranial pressure ....\nI call it my Ghost Tumor.

I did not see rainbows.

I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving slight water logged head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. Decreased cognitive ability. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are \"grabbing\" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point. When my eyes turn red I also feel a strong sensation of my pulse at the tips of my fingers and increased awareness of my heartbeat, but the doctor says everything about my heartbeat is normal. I feel a throbbing sensation in other parts of my body too.\nAlso when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related. When it goes back to feeling mostly normal and I feel better, my head still feels \"not solid\" and feels like I need to avoid bending over. I think I've also had a couple of small seizures, I fainted once in the bathroom and when becoming conscious again it was like my arms were locked together.\n\nSymptom Triggers:\nSome are stronger than others.\nPushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Bending over. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing. Also sudden or inconsistent sounds or flashing lights feel like they are \"grabbing\" at my heart or cause pain in my head.\n-----\nNow years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica from what I've read, except Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.\n\nNot sure if this has anything to do with it, I didn't feel different after this even, but also when about about 10 years old I was riding my bike in the street and I got knocked out, I remembered something about a lady saying something like \"Its your fault!\" I think I got hit by a car. I came home, later people told me for a few hours I didn't know who my family was and then I went to sleep for a few hours and woke up normal. They didn't take me to the ER or doctor for that either. I had scrapes on my body including my head. No scar or stitches from that. Broken bike though.\n\nConsidering all of the above, I have many symptoms and many theories. Could part of my brain be getting pinched in a crack in my cranium? Could my brain be swelling for some reason? Could I have a hernia in my nasal cavity somehow? How could that affect my brain?\nWhat connects my heels to my back and my head? I'm not sure.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/48828/possible-head-nerve-and-or-nasal-cavity-injury-many-confusing-undiagnosed-symptoms"},{"post":{"author":"mshka1967","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"painful leg moving toes","post_content":"Hi WebMD, I posted on here a number of times about Painful Leg Moving Toes Syndrome, from which I suffer.

I will be standing there, start to feel light headed and hot, my vision will get blurry, and within a minute or two I will pass out. I am only out for about 5 seconds but each time I am told my eyes are wide open staring at the ceiling. The first two times I was completely out. The most recent occurance however was a little different. I was at a concert and began to feel the effects coming on. I tried to fight it off but all of a sudden it hit me. This time however I was fully conscious when I fell. I could hear the music but it sounded like a weird distorted version of it, I could see shapes and patterns, and I was honestly unaware that I had fallen until I regained my vision and people were helping me up. It was almost as if I could feel my mind but not my body. As weird as it sounds it felt as if I was tripping on some sort of drug for a couple seconds. Each time it happens, if I try to stand back up afterwards, it happens again.

I am a young woman who was diagnosed with POTS since September of 2017. It took a very long time to get this diagnosis but has me questioning the diagnosis along with another reputable doctor. I am convinced it could be a CFS leak- based on my symptoms and findings. Hear me out and I’d love feedback if this could sound like it.\nMy first baby was born in 2014. Prior, I had been healthy, very active and fit; a gym rat. I had an epidural which worked well. Came out of that birth fine with some minor back pain, got back to getting fit and was in the best shape of my life.\nFeb of 2016, I fell pregnant again and the back pain really started up, where I had gotten my epidural over a year earlier. I saw a spinal specialist who couldn’t do much because I was pregnant. I had an extremely rough pregnancy, had home health care, very sick. Had another epidural, it was botched. I felt almost everything and it mostly numbed my right side. Coming out of that birth was rough. I started having worsening spine pain, headaches, tremors, nausea. I was convinced I had a spinal tumor. An X-ray showed nothing of my spine. I then was diagnosed Hashimoto’s, my thyroid was out of whack. I still continued to suffer from horrible headaches, tachycardia, exercise intolerance and the nausea is constant. All day, every day. That along with the horrendous fatigue, it’s hard to manage my children.\n\nI was diagnosed with POTS and kept having horrible headaches, more like very horrible head pressure. With a family history of aneurysms, they did an MRI/MRA. The imagine showed nothing but it was very much there. I had a “seizure” (in quotes because it was not). I thought I was having a TIA, I stiffened up and started convulsing. Prior to this moment, I was feeling like I was going out of my body, I couldn’t say any words, I couldn’t move, I was frozen but very aware. I was shaking and had a horrible headache. My husband called 911 and it took me to the nearest hospital. They did a CT without contrast which showed no migraine, no seizure, no stroke. I was very happy about that but it didn’t explain what just happened. I was so scared. The neurologist brushed it off as POTS, called it a clonic seizure intractable (HCC).\n\nI saw Dr. Jaeger, the director of autonomic disorders at Cleveland Clinic. He was the one who signed off on my tilt table test and he said it wasn’t impressive and didn’t show POTS, but my neurologist is going off of my symptoms and the poor man’s tilt table he did in his office. My neurologist said “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”, referring to my POTS. Dr. Jaeger is very well known in the autonomic/cardiology world and he doesn’t think I have POTS. Is it possible that I might have a CFS Leak due to my epidurals? I watched a stanford doctors video about a few women who were diagnosed with POTS, but they actually had CFS leak.\n\nIf I lay down, the pressure isn’t as horrible, but still there. The second I stand up, I get a splitting headache, horrible head pressure, mostly in the base of my skull but also goes to the front, a lot in my in temples. The pressure can get so unreal, I have to keep opening my jaw- like how you would on an airplane to relieve the pressure. It makes me nauseous, sometimes my vision gets weird, and I get overstimulated/light sensitive. It also feels like there’s burning in my head? These are not migraines either. The pressure also seems to worsen if I’ve lifted weights in the gym. I can feel it start up in the gym, with the base of my skull brewing with heavy pressure and then when I’m done at the gym, I feel as if my head could explode, popping off from my temples. I’m at a loss. I’m sick of going to the doctors. I’m sick of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. Something IS very wrong and it is affecting my life very badly.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/47962/could-this-be-a-cfs-leak"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Constant pressure in my head","post_content":"Hoping someone can point me in the right direction...I'm a 50-year-old Caucasian female experiencing increasing pressure in my head, almost constantly, for the past 5 months or so.

The Next day 2 days after the lightheadedness I started to know feel dizzy and nauseous and had quite a bit of neck pain the lightheadedness turned onto a full out headache. The next day now 3 days after the initial symptoms the dizziness and nauseau and neckpain got worse and I now had a fever around 104. On the 4th day the headache and other symptoms continued and my glands under my mouth were slightly enlarged. On the 5th day the fever was still going strong and the headache was extremely bad (not going to lie I cried a bit from the pain) it might be worth noting that I had no cough nor was my sinus in pain and no runny nose. The symptoms here continued for two-three more days before the fever supsides all in all it lasted about 1 week. At the end I was salivating like crazy like much much more than I have ever with other illnesses. I started to feel a bit better but the pain in my upper back where I can just reach if I put my hand back, aswell as I was extremely tired still and had a headache pretty much constantly that felt the worse around the back of my head and neck meets. I also had a rash on both of my elbows. I felt like it was hard to concentrate and had trouble sleeping even though I was extremely tired. I went back to work and had alot of trouble doing my job and concentrating so I went to the clinic now about 10 days after the symptoms started and 3 days after they ended. He suspected I had mono however the blood tests said otherwise so just moved on. About a month later now I am still feeling the headache in the back of my head and upper back pain aswell as neck pain. I also feel quite weak in my legs and kinda always feel like I'm going to fall over, like when riding the subway I used to be able to easily ride without holding on and today I was holding on for dear life and nearly tipped over 10 times. I wouldn't mind the pain but the headache is the worst because I have trouble thinking straight and sleeping, and I almost fall over every time I get up. Getting 9+ hours of sleep doesn't even feel like enough when before I could easily get away with 6. So I went back the the clinic and told him my symptoms that I still had and he recommended I went to ER for whatever reason. So I ended up going and I got a CT scan and more blood tests and they turned out to be Normal apparently. And I was released with no more information. It's been 4 days since then and I've tried to focus on keeping good posture and sleep straight on my back just incase it was some muscular issue, but it hasn't seemed to help at all.

Our truck was sent flying and spinning off the highway, reduced to rubble. I was not wearing a seat belt and got tossed around in the backseat. It was a miracle we survived.\n\nAfter getting some MRIs done I found out I had a massive arachnoid brain cyst (the size of an orange). It's benign. I was born with it. The cyst ruptured during the accident and leaked brain fluid, creating loads of pressure inside my head.\n\nThe hospital wouldn't perform surgery until I presented dangerous symptoms (not sure why). The pressure eventually grew greatly, breaking some blood vessels and filling my head with blood. That sent me straight to the hospital.\n\nI was experiencing splitting headaches, double vision, vomiting, and weakness/tingling in my legs. They fenestrated the cyst and drained the fluid.\n\nOver the following weeks and months I recovered very well.\n\nHowever, from time to time I still experience episodes of growing pressure inside my head, headaches, fogginess, and some double vision.\n\nI also noticed a spike in muscle stress around my head / face area. I'm grinding my teeth heavily at night. I'm squeezing and tightening my neck muscles throughout the day without realizing. I'm also experiencing some nervous tics around my eyes. Sometimes I can't stop twitching them, to the point that they hurt and my eye lid quivers on its own.\n\nBy the end of each week my entire head and face feel fatigued.\n\nAt first I thought these would go away on their own. But now it's been almost two years since surgery and I'm still experiencing this.\n\nMy biological father was diagnosed with mild Tourettes in his late 30s. I've never been tested myself.\n\nI have never posted on a medical forum before, and I've always tried to manage these symptoms on my own. But now it's getting to the point that I need some advice.\n\nI'd like to stay away from presciption medications as much as possible. I've considered maybe trying medical marijuana to allieviate some of these symptoms. But I've never tried it before and am unsure if I even qualify for a medical card.\n\nAny advice would be helpful.

Typically they have been motor manifestations, such as a relentless series of unstoppable jolts of my head in a movement similar to a nod (the one I’m doing right now), or sharply drawing my elbow backward and inward to the point where it hurts my shoulder and makes it feel severely eroded. Others include the sharp sudden clenching of my abdominal muscles or the flicking of my big toe against my second toe out.

I had no words after I read that, nothing I would put on here anyway.

My dad has been having very painful headaches for a year now. They pretty much last all day and he has been taking 3 Advil 3-4 times a day to keep ahead of them. He has seen Primary Doctor, Neurologist, Neuro Surgeon, Ear Nose and Throat Doc, Eye Doctor, has had many MRI, Xrays, Ultrasounds, blood work, etc. All come up clean. His symptoms keep getting worse. Maybe 7 months ago he started complaining about the headaches waking him up out of sleep if he were to lay on his back. Then he said he would turn on his side and they would go away. Then two months ago he started complaining about having double vision if he looked anywhere not straight ahead. Less than a week ago he went to the doctor for results on a plethora of tests he had just gotten done (tests were all clean), and while at the doctor office he lost his memory. Not complete amnesia, but he had no idea what was talked about at the doctors office. He couldn't really put words together to form a sentence. They admitted him to the hospital in the stroke unit (he didn't have a stroke) where he spent 4-5 days and got the typical MRI and blood work. Didn't show anything. He also had an EEG and they checked his carotid. All came up clean. He is now back home still having headaches and still \"Fuzzy\" as he describes since his memory loss incident.\n\nMy dad does have a mass in his head. A dermoid cyst. They discovered that over 20 years ago randomly and when compared to MRI today they said it hasn't changed at all in that time period so that is most likely not the cause. All our doctors can do is order MRI tests and refer to other people who just order another MRI and then say \"I dunno\". I am desperate for any other ideas. The doctorsc mentioned something about his excessive Advil use that can cause rebound headaches or something like that. I see where they are coming from, but I don't think that can cause memory loss and double vision. Can it? His symptoms again are awful headaches that change spots, fatigue, double vision, memory loss (blackout?), feeling fuzzy and out of it. We have been referred to an eye neurologist but if that doesn't pan out I think we will be heading to Mayo in Minnesota.

I looked through WebMD and it will be my first time posting.\nI'm from Malaysia, and I pretty much carry a lot of problems with me, literally.\nI have severe allergic rhinitis since I was a kid, currently 24.\nIt was always a problem for me as I would always have to spit out my phlegm every few minutes. When I was 22, there was a serious case of haze that happened for months and I had a severe fever.\nWhen I recovered, suddenly my legs were feeling very itchy, and it just wouldn't go away. At the end, I was not able to sleep for 10 days and I became suicidal. I was really lucky to be saved, not to go into detail but I was still very sick. I don't even get phlegm anymore, instead it was blood. Antihistamine made my legs worse and I still didn't know I had RLS.\nI went to many doctors of GP, neurologist and psychiatrist. Did a bunch of test like nerve conduction and etc, but nothing. I live in Malaysia, so the medical technology was obviously not as advanced as the western countries. Then, I went to a local neurologist and she managed to diagnose that I have RLS. I was eating Sifrol, I think it differs from other brands but it's medicine for Parkinson's. It worked well initially but I had to increase the dose by a lot.\nIn the end, I could not afford it and had to go for other methods, which is Chinese acupuncture. It helped a lot, but other problems arise.\nEven when many years before I had gotten RLS, I had been a heavy bodybuilder and may have lifted too heavy over the years. I'm not sure if it's related but I think I might have damaged my nerves as well, perhaps known as peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSo currently, I will list down my problems that I have.\n1. Heart palpitations to the point that sometimes it hurts\n2. Unable to pee properly, sometimes I feel I could pee finish or frequently peeing.\n3. I became much more clumsy.\n4.

First I would get a GOOD neuro and have a sleep test. You have sleep apnea, that is easy to see. With this being treated, much on your list should go away. RLS is a result of sleep apnea and medication may be involved. Medications have side effects, so I would encourage you to FIRST try the CPAP if it is prescribed, and then see what happens after 7 to 10 days. If you are still having trouble, it should be less, and then the dosage of meds won't be so high. There are alternative ways to handle this that are usually successful.

It left a small bump that is already going down a little. I felt a little foggy afterwards but really didn't notice any major symptoms besides the scalp pain where I hit my head. About four hours later I got extremely tired, given it was 10pm by that point but I was much more tired than usual. I also started having a pressure in my head, like a tension or sinus headache and that pressure was stemming from where i actually hit. The scalp pain also started to spread back to the crown of my head and that seems to be where most of the pain/bruise is now and today that scalp pain/bruise is worse. it's very tender and bruised that I can tell and I understand that being normal. What I'm worried about is the pressure headache and the migraines. The headache is acting like a migraine, it goes away or fades with rest and sleep and then comes back and worsens with activity, watching tv, reading, etc. The pain is mostly at the local spot where I hit and then in the back of the head along with the pressure that's all over.\n\nI'm not having any other symptoms related to concussion or serious head injury.

This was a constant thing for maybe a month or so, which finally died down to pain in my heel after walking for longer than around 20-30 minutes.

These shocking pains are in bursts around 5-10 seconds apart and all together last around 10 minutes. Often after these episodes my leg and foot feels tingly and slightly numb.

Since July I have been so sick. Before I became sick, I was a healthy and active 24 year old woman who worked out in the gym everyday was a full time college student and worked part time. It all started with me becoming extremely weak, and every time I would stand up I would become very dizzy and my heart would race. I also was very nauseated, would break out into sweats, had body aches and sharp pains that felt like pins and needles sticking me all over. I thought maybe it was my blood sugar so I started to eat more before I went to the gym. When I was at work one day I felt like I was going to faint even though I had ate. I went to the ER and the doctor done a ton of blood work, CT scan of my head, EKG, and a chest x ray. Every thing came back normal except a little bacteria in my urine. The doctor said I was orthostatic because of my heart rate going up every time I would stand up so he gave me a couple bags of IV fluid and sent me home with an antibiotic. I thought my symptoms was due to the UTI, but I was wrong. I went to my family doctor and he done more blood work to check for other things like Lyme's disease and mono. He also ordered an echo of my heart and for me to wear a heart monitor for a month. The echo and blood work came back clear, except it showed I had active mono. This would be the 3rd time I've had mono in my life. Thinking that's why I was feeling this way I was relieved. I continued to wear the heart monitor over the month of August. My symptoms just kept getting worse. I went back to the ER again cause my heart rate was 150 and I couldn't even sleep. They done more blood work and tests, including an abdominal CT scan to make sure my spleen and liver wasn't enlarged due to mono. Everything came back clear. They gave me a coupe bags of IV fluid and some Ativan to help me sleep and sent me home. My symptoms only became worse. I couldn't sleep for days, my heart rate was going up to 200 bpm. My whole body was in so much pain and I began to have burning sensations. After my skin stopped burning, my whole body went numb. It started with my legs going numb and worked its way up my body. I also couldn't taste, smell, or see good. I hardly could put any weight on my legs. I literally had to hold to the walls to even get to the bathroom because I couldn't hardly walk. I thought I was going to die. My body felt like it was shutting down. I couldn't even eat because I was so nauseated. My doctor done more blood work to check for autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. He also checked my cortisol levels. Which all was normal. He ordered an MRI of my brain, and it came back normal. Gradually my sense of feeling, smelling, and taste came back. I still can't feel things like I used to. Nothing tastes the same either. Smells make me nauseated, even if its good smells. My personality as even changed. I can't hardly remember things anymore. I went from being a happy, social, and smart person to someone who has so much anger over everything, can't think or focus and hates to be around people. My hair is also falling out bad. All my friends and family think I'm crazy and its just anxiety and depression, but I know something bad happened to me. I still feel horrible and weak all the time. I can't hardly get out of the bed.

I went to my PCP, who observed marked cogwheel ratcheting in my right arm, and we both suspected early Parkinson's. The neurologist observed the same thing and said he also suspected PD. Neurologist started me on amantadine.\n\nRight after this, I started using estrogen cream for urinary problems. As soon as I started the cream, the stiffness in my right arm went away, as well as the tremor.\n\nMy gait, however, continued to be affected, and I was getting slower & slower & shuffling more. I had completely lost my sense of smell, and my digestive system had ground to an almost halt...but the worst symptoms were cognitive. I would get lost while driving in a familiar area. I would have trouble using the intermittent wiper. I would have trouble figuring out how to get my car into D. I could not negotiate any kind of tricky parking. I would forget why I was talking to a person...I started getting good at not panicking and looking for clues about a conversation, and got pretty good at covering my memory lapses.\n\nFast forward to May of 2016. I requested my PCP give me oral estrogen - I wanted to see whether there was an estrogen connection for me. Everything got better. My sense of smell returned. Very slowly, my thinking started to clear. My gait got better.\n\nNo other neurologist witnessed the cogwheel ratcheting, and I look really healthy, compared with many of their other patients. They had no interest in my complaints of cognitive difficulty, and basically told me to keep taking antidepressants...the most recent of these neurologists, who is a movement specialist, told me that my symptoms are from menopause.\n\nBut every single symptom I have is consistent with Parkinson's or with Parkinson's plus. And by the way, I still take amantadine every day.\n\nSince last spring, the physical manifestations of the neurological problems have started to return very slowly, however, my cognition continues to improve. I have every hope that my body will continue to respond to estrogen, and that I can keep my brain in working order.\n\nIt is MADDENING that no neurologist seems to have interest in my case. I'm not actually looking for a diagnosis (although I would appreciate it if a doctor would suspend judgement and believe what I say).\n\nI am looking for a long-term partner to help me with my neurological health. My neurological issues are not from depression or anxiety (although I have both) --- currently, I can usually walk like a normal person if I put my mind to it.\n\nMy current issue that is hardest to deal with are leg cramps at night...like nothing I ever experienced previously. The seem to come out of nowhere and affect muscles that I didn't know could cramp like that. I usually take methocarbamol when I have really tight muscles. I like that it does not sedate me (when I take it in the daytime).\n\nBut my main purpose in writing here is...does anybody know of a doctor in the New York state or New England area who might be interested in working with me?\n\nWell...that...and, have other people had trouble getting a diagnosis even though they knew it was Parkinson's?","like_count":"0","tags":["Parkinson's Disease"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/37840/frustrated-no-diagnosis"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"In pain","post_content":"I've been seeing, GP, cardiologist, GI, and RA Doctors for chest pain, body pain, dizziness.

I receive bi-monthly Remicade infusions to maintain remission.\n\nIn July 2017 my hands/forearms began going numb. The numbness would not go away despite position changes. The numbness was painful and would wake me up in the night. I saw the doctor. She did x-rays on my hands & neck (both normal), a full blood work-up was ordered (normal), and an EMG was performed. The EMG revealed mild Carpal Tunnel in my right arm, but this didn't explain the issues in my left arm or account for the severity of my symptoms. I was sent to Physicals therapy for 8 weeks, which did little to nothing. Meanwhile. The pain moved to my upper arms and began in my hips.\n\nThe pain is very much so associated with movement, not painful to the touch. It feels stiff and I've joked that it must be rigor Mortus (sp?).\n\nWhen I received my Remicade infusion, all the pain subsides within 24 hours. However, within 1 week the pain returned. Less in my arms and more in my hips/knees.\n\nAfter another infusion, the pain subsided and returned within a week. This time solely in my feet and far worse than ever before.\n\nI've seen my GP several times and she is at a loss. I've spoken with my GI, also at a loss. I've seen a neurologist who gave me a muscle relaxer to take before bed. This accomplished nothing.

Forgot to mention , i have also been getting these attacks almost like asthma but only when im freaking myself out or during light exersize. Even when i talk its exhausting. My limbs are hard to move and people laugh when i ealk becausw it feels hard to move. My feet vibrate sometimes and it doesnt hurt it just tells me something is wrong. When i move around even for a little bit i get a sharp line of pain in my abdomen. When i stretch i dont feel a stretch it just feels uncomfortable and doesmt feel right. I think i might have nerve problems because thats what it sounds like. I'm ao tired of this. I just want to die im so sick of this. I'm only 15 and im a sophomoore and i feel like i cant enjoy anything anymore. I get no relief, ever its always constant even in my dreams i feel exactly the same. I have asked my parents multiple times to take me to the doctor but everytime i go it never helps. I got diagnoaed with asthma and i think one doctor thought i was just a deluaional teen and just told me to drink more water. Its so frustrating especially when you live in a state with literally the worst healthcare in the us. It hurts more when your parents just keep saying its just your hormones everytime they catch me cryimg in my closet because i feel like dying.

My moving toes started about five years ago. There was no precipitating event, no accident. I just noticed one evening that my toes were moving. In order to get my diagnosis, I saw three neurologists, a podiatrist, my PCP, and my chiropractor. The third neurologist made the call after seeing my foot for about 10 seconds. Then he said, \"I suppose I should look at all your tests and reports--they're all normal, right?\" (Right!).\n\nI feel blessed that I am relatively pain free, although I do experience extreme achiness from time to time. I wear toe separators to sleep, as the movements can be maddening and keep me awake. I don't take any medications for it, although I did try gabapentin. My biggest fear is that pain will eventually set in. My neurologist said that chances are that won't happen, but that this condition is so rare that no one really knows the prognosis in any particular case.\n\nI was in contact with a foreign doctor via email, and I speculated that painless legs and moving toes is under reported because many people probably wouldn't bother seeing a doctor if the movement was the only symptom. He agreed. I would love if this site could grow enough so that we could entice a specialist to study us for commonalities among our histories and symptoms to see if we could collectively get closer to an effective treatment.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/35401/painless-legs-and-moving-toes"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"MRI results","post_content":"Our 12 month old daughter had an mri done on her brain as she has some developmental delays and shows some symptoms of possible cerebral palsy.

I sure hope someone can help.\n\nI'm a forty seven year old male in average health. I don't smoke and drink very little. I don't have any conditions that I know about.\n\nAbout eighteen months ago I started to experience these symptoms out of nowhere. There's a sort of heavy feeling in my head, not pain but very unpleasant and constant. I also have low energy and I'm quite tired, drowsy a lot of the time.\n\nI was on 20mg citalopram at the time and had been on it for several years without issue. The first doctor I saw put my dose up by 10mg and it got worse so I figured it was the meds. The doctor ordered blood work which all came back normal. As far as he was concerned that was it. End of story.\n\nSince then I've seen three other general practitioners, two psychiatrists, three naturopaths and none of them have been able to tell me what's wrong with me. The psychiatrists tried changing my meds but they had the same result. I also had a CT scan which came back normal.\n\nI told my psychiatrist that I'd like to try coming off the anti depressant so we worked out a plan to come off it over a few weeks, dropping the dose 5mg every two weeks. I noticed that when I reduced the dose I felt better but the symptoms reasserted themselves within a few days.\n\nI was finally off the medication completely for two months but the symptoms didn't go away completely. They got better but they were still there.\n\nI was having a hard time coping with the depression so the psychiatrist suggested I go back on them and prescribed sertraline. The symptoms immediately came back as strong as ever. I stopped again after a week.\n\nI've noticed that the anti depressant is not the only thing that triggers the symptoms. Non prescription medication such as anti histamine will do it, as will certain herbal supplements like 5HTP and St Johns Wort (for the depression), and also gluten.\n\nI don't know where else to turn I just know I can't live like this. I googled a diagnostician and contacted her in the hopes she might be able to diagnose me, I'm just waiting to hear back from her. Am I on the right track or should I see some other type of specialist?

Specifically,\n\"Extra-axial mass with central calcification along the right vertex\"\n\"underlying mass effect without underlying signal abnormality\"\n\"no underlying parenchymal signal abnormality\"\n\"calcification along the anterior falx\"\n\nI might be repeating a few of those, I'm mainly looking for info on the location of the mass. I have been reffered to a neorosurgeon and their office says I have to wait for them to call me to make an appointment to talk to someone.\nAny help on the meaning of the findings would be appreciated, thank you in advance.\nKrystalinentity","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/34903/need-help-with-deciphering-my-mri-findings---mass-effect"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Acromegaly screen and hormone therapy.","post_content":"Hi, I'm a mtf transgender individual and I had an acromegaly screen a few months ago.

Please read to the end as this is the tricky part. I will try to make this long story as short as possible. He started to have bilateral wrist pain 1.5 years ago. In addition he lost weight, became depressed and fatigued. He had started working at a new job that required repetitive wrist movements so we assumed it was related. We went to ortho and primary. They ruled out lymes, arthritis and a number of other viruses. EMG was negative. The second ortho found a tear through contrast mri in his right wrist which was the wrist causing the most pain. He eventually had surgery. However he continues to lose weight and have pain in both wrists and forearms. Due to the chronic pain he has become anxious and depressed. I am a very worried mom. Here is the kicker - he just told me that a week before the onset of the pain and start of the downward spiral he got electrical shock at work.

I have slight weakness in my left arm but not tingling or shaking any where.\n\n\nI did have gastro a week a go so I was thinking it could be Gullian Bare syndrome? But that has even weakness doesn’t it and also tingling which I don’t have? Also I’m having muscle wasting all over my body like in my legs too and idk if that is caused by it?\n\n\nDoctors did urine sample and blood tests and all came back fine also had a basic neurological exam (they tapped me with this metal thing and did a strength test) and I got 5 for strength and didn’t have any hyperflexia but my left arms still feels a little weak like holding my phone. Also have lost 5kgs in like a week even though my diet is healthy and appetite is fine.\n\n\nThe doc I spoke to said I can’t lose muscle that quickly so she thinks I’m not losing muscle, is that true?\n\n\nSometimes I get really overcome with general fatigue especially when my body gets hot and later in the afternoon. That makes me think it could be MS but MS doesn’t cause muscle wasting and atrophy does it?? Correct me if I’m wrong!\n\n\nI’ve got an MRI scheduled for next week. Would that rule out ALS? I calculated the odds and it’s like 1 in 1 million of me having ALS due to my age but you never know??\n\n\nAlso does the onset of muscle atrophy in als happen really quickly like visible muscle wasting in the hands occurring daily?\n\n\nLastly it’s expensive to go to the doctor in my country and just those simple tests cost $700 and the MRI would be another $600 so like that plays a role too and I’m a student so my parents are paying. They said they don’t want me to have the MRI “cause the other tests came back showing nothing is wrong”. Is that correct?

When I had GB I started feeling weak and fatigue. Then my right leg went totally numb and I couldn't stand. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital ER. In ER I got weaker and weaker. The doctors we're talking about ALS or MS, when an ER resident came in and said I have GB, which he had just studied last week. I was immediately given an MRI and based on symptoms and results of MRI I was admitted to the hospital. I kept getting weaker and eventually became fully paralyzed. There's one test that could identify if I had GB, a spinal tap.\n\nI refused the spinal tap because I remember having Polio in 1954 and had many spinal taps, which back then were extremely painful. After several weeks I gave in and had a spinal tap. They did find that I was having GB.\n\nI've been misdiagnosed with ALS, similar to Post-Polio. And MS, similar to GB. So, the MRI and other tests showed GB. GB, like MS have similar symptoms. The root cause may be different, but resulting damage to the nerves is the same - it demylates the insulation around the nerves. GB is sudden, MS is over time. Both are worse when it's hot (Post-Polio is worse in the cold), can't win.\n\nNeurological issues can cause your symptoms. But, there are other things it could be. What concerns me is your weight loss and possible wasting of your muscles. I would let a neurologist exam you, and follow up with any tests like MRI or nerve conduction tests.\n\nGB causes a whole host of problems, e.g. Numbness, Weakness, pins and needles tingling especially in the hands and feet, double vision. It also causes a burning feeling on the bottom of my feet making it too painful to stand. Same symptoms as MS. So, find the best neurologist in your area and go from there.\n\nYou may want to go online and Google \"GBS Foundation\". They have lots of info. Unfortunately, I don't have a link available.\n\nI'm following your post, should you have any other questions. Hope you get a proper diagnosis.

I woke up one morning and felt \"wrong\" like I was going to fall over--my head just felt wrong. I thought maybe I was having a heart attack--actually I was, and still am pretty heart-healthy-- anyway, \"dizziness\" is a top three complaint and it could be a thousand things. They gave me xanax thinking I was drug seeking, I think. I went home to rest. I took time off from work. When I laid down and did nothing, THAT is when the myoclonic jerks in my head and upper left side started. I had no idea what the hell it was. I went to a neurologist SURE I had a brain tumor or something. But he was not alarmed and wrote me a script for \"Primary Myoclonus\" Primary means you have it without other things. Secondary means there are bad diseases that go with it. It is 11 years later and the myoclonus has remained stable more or less. Therefore it is called \"Essential Myoclonus.\" I do have this this slightly to moderately dizzy component with it. I have had 2 big head MRIs, 2 EEGs, EKGs, Carotid Artery study, eye exams etc. etc. etc. all of which have come out normal! So there is TMI for you! I take my Klonopin still.

Do you know if it is biologically recognizable?, I mean, you've had many tests and yet they haven't find anything in the brain? How did your doctor realized it was essential myoclonus? Last year I had many seizures as a result of extreme stressful situations, they just checked me and told me I had to learn how to control my stress (I really don't know how to manage stressful situations, not even simple arguments). This year it happened but two times because I've tried hard to stay away from anything that could make me worry and it has been working, though I still have muscle spasms from time to time (actually when I'm too tired, when it's cold and the other triggers you mentioned). Have you had a seizure because of this? I haven't visited a neurologist yet because most of the doctors I've visited are just, I don't know, too traditional, they always try to find the most common condition you might have and they would save the effort of trying a bit hard and consider not frequent conditions as a possibility.\nReply\nrubyrena\nover 3 years ago\nThe way they diagnose Essential Myoclonus is by ruling OUT all the other stuff it could be. My neurologist still doesn't actually KNOW what is causing this. Despite all that testing. His best guess is it could be somehow genetic. My mother had MS (relapsing kind) but I do not however. I have not had a genetic test. I think they can see things on your DNA.\n\nI couldn't believe how many uncomfortable tests I had to undergo when I first reported this. But the doctors have to order the tests. They can't assume all is well in the brain. It is amazing and scary what they CAN actually see!\n\nIt could simply be a tic (?)\n\nAnyway, I forgot to mention I have an old ski injury which resulted in a pinched nerve on my mid-to-upper left back. I have had this irritation on that spinal nerve (not necessarily pain) for over 25 years. Maybe that fired up somehow to cause the jerking in my later years. Who knows?\n\nMedicine is art as well as science. I know better now than to go to the doctor complaining of vague dizziness. Since it has been 11 years of myoclonus without it progressing to something else, my condition was diagnosed as Essential Myoclonus.\n\nMy neuro does ask me every time I see him if I have had a REAL seizure. (losing consciousness) The answer is thankfully NO. When I'm reading stuff about epilepsy however, I can relate--triggers etc.\n\nThe obsession! I get it. There is MUCH more treatment for epilepsy than myoclonus albeit that is a more serious condition. If you see a neurologist, my best advice is to be assertive and SPECIFIC. AND primary brain tumors are rare! (in case that is part of your worry arsenal)\n\nSorry I write so much. This always happens!\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 3 years ago\nThank you so much for all the information. I'm already searching for a neurologist who can help me as I need.

Four weeks ago he started having what appeared to be seizures (he shook violently all over for about five minutes, resulting in falling). But they weren't true seizures (he remained alert and had no \"recovery\" time afterwards). It happened five times within one week. His neurologist diagnosed it as \"post syncopal myoclonus\" and said it was caused by a combination of low blood pressure and dehydration. My husband suddenly became very sick from an infection (\"from an unknown source\"), as well as the low blood pressure, and spent six days in a hospital and two weeks in an inpatient rehab center. We learned that about 30% of Parkinson's patients have problems with low blood pressure as the brain is no longer able to regulate it properly. This causes dizziness on standing (or sitting from lying down), and can cause one to faint.

And last night I drank some wine, too much really, about a bottle and a half. So when I woke up this morning I was not surprised to find my thinking a little fuzzy.\n\nBut I felt pretty normal. I went into the kitchen, got a cup of coffee and sat down at my computer where I found myself unable to remember the last three letters of my seven-letter password. I've entered this password into my computer probably 10 times a day for at least five years. It's also a common word, not something made up.\n\nAnd yet I couldn't remember the last three letters.\n\nSo I said to myself - aloud - something like \"What the hell is wrong with me?\" But actually I didn't really say that because I found I couldn't speak. I could make noise but I couldn't make my mouth form words.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I was able to force myself to say the names of some people I know - Mom, Joe, Tom, then a few simple sentences. But I sounded (and I don't mean to be insensitive here) like someone who'd had a serious stroke. And I was beginning to worry that's what had happened to me.\n\nMeanwhile, I could walk and move just fine, I'd remembered my password, and I could read normally. But I still couldn't talk.\n\nAlso, my thinking was normal and, for some reason, I was pretty sure what was happening to me would be temporary.\n\nAnd it was. After about 20 or 25 minutes, in the space of just a second, my speech returned and I was back to normal. It was like someone flipped a switch.\n\nMaybe I should also mention that during the whole episode I had a very runny nose.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone else ever experienced something like this? My theory is that part of my brain hadn't woken up yet but that's a complete guess.\n\nAnyway, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.\n\nAnd no, I haven't seen a doctor yet but I'm planning to next week.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWilliam in Brooklyn","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/27192/weird-health-episode-this-morning"},{"post":{"author":"brookedlouhy1","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Why does your skin turn pale?","post_content":"What causes you to lose color in your skin or become pale in your face after losing blood through a large cut somewhere on your body?

I tend to search every crevice for an answer, most have been found.As of late, I’ve learned the meaning of helpless. My son has changed, everyday I see it. I cant fix it & I feel like I’m losing him. Last year we moved from the only place he called home to Waynesboro pa. A few months later,after dealing with passing sadness & waves of home sick crashing around us, my son began having these episodes that are best described as an autistic type meltdown. They are brought on by stressors such as frustration, or me asking him to do something he wasn't prepared to do,like me saying, “peyt bedtime, “ or his most frequent stressor from the past was accidently breaking his mouse from his fidgeting(causes worst meltdown). I can usually tell when his control is slipping or if it is going to be a troubled day. In the past, when these stressors happened the change was gradual & he could sometimes calm down if left alone. Now, he snaps first into a rage of bashing his desk, forcing his chair arm, squeezing a remote till it cracks, his strength is intensified & with it the rage, I must move him from the initial area to his bed, soft things wont cause pain. With this comes the headache, extreme sound and light sensitivity, repeating words to himself, stimming, unable to communicate in sentence form, unable to move his legs to walk or stand (brain appears stuck in a loop). When I tell him to move to the bed he doesn’t hear, he repeats loudly as if responding to the initial stressor. When finally he hears and he tries to comply, he can’t make his body move, his brain seems stuck. He tries harder to get up from his chair and his legs start to move & kick like running. Then he rocks in a hunched position and repeats,”wait, waaaaaaaait, just wait. “ He never gets his legs to move functionally but he gets to the bed, with prodding I get him to drink his chamomile tea & he begins to calm. His calm down always ends in tears, sadness of past life events and crying. He has no memory of these episodes. If he is slipping into one he cannot focus on any task & he retains no information. For instance, Peyt very much enjoys editing videos & was working on a project close to bedtime when I said, “hey lil guy almost bed time, “ he snapped into the beginnings of an episode. He repeated no no no no no & rocked. Then hes unresponsive to my words, as if he cant hear them, however during these times sound & light disturbs him to extremes. His hearing turns extraordinary & he repeats\"why are you shouting, why are you shouting,\" when it was but a whisper of words I spoke.He s unable to feel normal for days after. This began last year. His anxiety has been crippling this week, any mentions of outside or future plans & he starts to slip away. He also gets headaches, cold sweats, hot chills and his vision has worsened.\nWhen Peyton began school I took quick notice of him being 8-12in taller than every child. At 13 hes now 5.9, with a deep voice, facial & other hair (found grey hair on is scalp)also his head is almost an inch in circumference larger than the adult male standard(I hadn't noticed at the time of appointment, so it wasnt mentioned to the endocrine) This year he was tested for gigantism, I was told his hand xray revealed he was in the growth stage of a 17 year old.\nFrom around age 7 change was an issue, but he was able to cope within a day. Once I bought him a gaming chair he had been asking for, he cried over the old one, saying he can't take it, he can't take it. We got a kitten and he cried, muttering words of, \"it's too different, I can't keep it,\" all the while he hugged and nuzzled its little furry body. I also had to advance warn/remind him of any arrangements, in countdown form, from a week away to a few days to a few hours to a few minutes. If we were going to the movies with mom-mom, I would do the usual countdown, Peyt, we’re going to the movies in 2 days, 1 day, 1hr, 30mins, 15mins... This made things easier, except for nights before, and always at bedtime, when his anxiety of what is to come upon his waking, looms over him like a blanket of dread. On such nights even if it is something that I must do & in no way involves him, the questions begin, \" how long will it take, are you sure it's just the movies, when will we/you be back, what if I can't fall asleep(but for holidays, he has never had a problem sleeping), \" &t it continues from 30mins to hours. He also had a mild ocd (turning, checking door knob & unable to not touch curious things, like smudges in the toilet bowl) he overcame parts of it quickly. Now 13 he touches things, especially in stores, just last month he asked \"mom, can you please not leave a pan soaking? I have to touch it &I know I don't want to.”\n\nAny ideas, hunches, experiences, I’ll take them. I need direction. I had lymes and Im still symptomatic. Today, I thought, maybe a tick borne disease could be a cause of his new behaviors? He has Keystone central chip&has seen his pcp who referred him to an endocrine for possible acromegaly(told he is normal) and psychiatrist(im afraid will only treat symptoms &miss an underlying cause that may be apparent to others). I have no strength left, this week has taken all of me. I am just a mom whose only want is for her littleguy to be okay. He was okay & now he’s not & I don’t know how to help him. I don’t know who to ask or where to go to find him help.\nKatrina","like_count":"1","tags":["Caregiving"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/26365/13yr-boy-has-autistic-meltdown-type-episodes-that-started-last-year"},{"post":{"author":"helloirene","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Have had serious Falls","post_content":"Have had 3 serious falls , one the worst - I fell before i knew what was happening - I hit myself on the back of my Head- and soft area behind left shoulder - -was working for a well known company - they igmored the fall, and I let it go -- hoping I would live - - in about a week, I had a rainbow neon circle in one eye - in a couple months I had muscle spasms in onee shoulder -- eventually both shoulder-at the same time -- -another fall.

He had non-affected parents and 8 siblings, his condition was tentatively attributed to a heavy head trauma with brain contusion 14 years prior to the illness, and possibly lifetime diesel exhaust exposure (there was a study about truck drivers more suspectible to SALS). In August 2015, I started to feel a heaviness/subclinical weakness in my left arm and hand, which was worse in cold weather, but mostly gone into remission by now. Shortly after that, I started experiencing bodywide fasciculations, for which I had exams in September 2015. The neurological exam was unremarkable, the EMG found no abnormality in the left opponens pollicis, abductor digiti minimi and tibialis anterior. I also had negative SOD1 and C9orf72 tests.\n\nThe fasciculations waxed and waned, slightly controlled by Carbamazepine and Diazepam, but somewhat worsened in the last few months, which I attributed to work-related stress. I have a hot spot over my left eyebrow which has been twitching almost non-stop for 2 years. Sometimes when I twitch, I experience an electric-shock like sensation going down the side of my neck.\n\nI have high arches (inherited from my mother) and I also experienced mild sensory symptoms, essential tremor, joint cracking, migrating back pain (scoliosis/sitting for long in an abnormal posture?) a spontaneously resolving right abducens palsy, and moderate trigeminal neuralgia-like episodes (every 3-4 months, moves from one side of the jaw to the other). Cramps were rare (once every 3-4 weeks), nightly and always happened in the calves. Prior to the onset of my disease, I had (mostly morning) nausea and vomiting for 3-4 years, which resolved appr. when the other symptoms started. I also had (and has) proctalgia fugax for years. My cervical MRI in 2015 was unremarkable (scoliosis), my cranial MRI in 2016 showed a DVA and a non specific periventricular occipital T2 lesion.\n\nIn December 2016 I had a NCS, which found a mild carpal tunnel in my right hand and mild generalized temporal dispersion suggestive of demyelination. I had a clean immune test, incl. anti-GM1. In July 2017 I had a 2 week episode of left shoulder stiffness, which was found to be not spastic in a neuro exam. I also had a 2 day neck stiffness shortly after that, which I attributed to my lifestyle and work. In the last few weeks, I started to feel bilateral knee stiffness/\"wobbling\"/\"jelly-like feeling\" (worse in the left side), which causes tremor when standing up after sitting for long. However, I was still able to hike 10+ miles in an difficult terrain even though I'm not athletic. What's more, my legs felt somewhat better after that.\n\nA follow-up EMG in this September picked up the following abnormalities, which is summarized by the EMG neurologist as \"minor abnormalities of uncertain etiology\"\nMild amplitude reduction and temporal dispersion (worse than in 2016) in the left peroneus with decreased F-Wave persistence.\nIncreased insertional activity, CRDs when moving the needle or percussion, fibs and psw in certain needle positions in the left tibialis anterior. Mild subacute neur. lesion.\nIncr. ins. activity, fibs when moving the needle, no spontaneous activity at rest. mild polyph. MUP in the left deltoid. This muscle was considered normal (?) in the summary\nIncr. ins. activity, fasciculations, fibs in multiple needle positions, active partial denervation in the left frontalis.\nAplitude increase, fibs and fasciculations in some needle positions in the right longissimus thoracic. Subacute neur. lesion.\nInterference pattern/recruitment were otherwise normal.\n\nMy questions/concerns about this EMG are the following:\nMy understanding is that cranial and paraspinal denervation are highly specific for ALS. In that sense, and given the other findings, how valid are the \"minor\" and \"unspecific\" terms in the EMG summary\nMy understanding from the poly MUP in my arm EMG that it's indicative of reinnervation. Is it possible in ALS to practically regain all strength for months in a muscle?\nDo the non-MND symptoms point to something or are they appear to be incidental findings?\n\nI strongly lean toward PMA/LMN-dominant ALS, but the onset of my symptoms, the lack of clinical weaknes, no athrophy (I have a dent in my right gluteus, but my neuro said it was pressure lipoathrophy, and I believe her), improvement in my arm and other symptoms seem very strange...","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/24531/dirty-emg-familiar-als-after-2-years-of-fasciculations"},{"post":{"author":"snowins","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Seizure","post_content":"I have had a tonic clonic seizure and partial, but I am wondering if this could have been a type of seizure.

I have used Atenolol and Propranolol, which both have worked. The problem is that they only work for about 4-5 hours, and I need it to work for a whole day (around 18 hours).\n\nThis brings me to my question: Which beta blocker do you recommend for my problem, that fits the duration criteria? I would really appreciate it if I could get a list of several different brands.\n\nFrom what I have read it is very common to use Propranolol and Atenolol for blushing (and other anxiety symptoms, like shaking, trembling of the voice, etc.). Other beta blockers are rarely mentioned, even though there are many beta blockers with a much greater half-life. Is there any difference between the beta blockers, other than the half life? If there is, I would like to know which ones you think is best suited for my problem. What’s more, to reduce the amount of side effects. I only need it to stop the blushing (calm down the «fight and flight mechanism» of the nervous system), and I don’t take it for heart reasons or anything like that. The more a beta blocker is «interacting with several different aspects of the body», of course the greater the side effects. So, the less the beta blocker works on the body, other than what I am taking it for, the better.\n\nSummation:\n• Which beta blockers work for at least 18 hours, and can be taken every day?\n• Which beta blockers do you recommend, when you also take in to account minimizing the side effects?\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond to this!

The first Doctor just dismissed our research and kept pumping her with various drugs and families of drugs until they exhausted their course of medications and treatments and then started to repeat them again. Wasting more time. We finally went to a few more doctors (Pain specialists and Neurologist's) but they basically did the same thing and this time we brought up the possibility of Dementia or Alzheimer’s. We were dismissed of that Idea because they all said she was too young. Age 54 at the time. After about 2 years we finally went to another Neurologist's, a female doctor this time and had more tests done and expressed out concerns about Dementia. This doctor finally looked into it and did several quick tests and determined my wife did have Alzheimer’s. Why are doctors so quick to dismiss this disease?

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced.\n\n*May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.)\nA few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.\n*June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way.\n*June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) \"brain fog\", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.\n*After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*.\nFrom June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms.\nI was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.\n*June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside.\n*June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist.\n*June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.\nA few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( Could this be a neurological problem? brain damage? fibromyalgia?

It started because I had very poor posture when sitting at the computer hunched over for long periods of time. When the pain first occurred, it was so severe that I stayed up all night screaming. The day prior I felt a little soreness in my shoulder, but when the pain came full force I could not even sleep. I never went to the hospital at the time, which I probably should have. The pain lasted for a few days and then I woke up the following morning with a winged scapula. My shoulder blade protruded 2-3 inches from my back for about 3 months. I tried going to physical therapy and few times but found it was not working and it was also too expensive ($100 per visit). The winged scapula finally went away on its own, but a lingering pain remained. When I put pressure on the exact point of the pain, it feels much better. This is only temp. relief. I've found that heavily working my arms and shoulders temporarily numbs the pain as well (ex. Boxing, weightlifting). When I get busy with work and spend long hours at the computer and standing up, my shoulder pain gets far worse. It comes back nearly full force to the night 4 years ago when I could not sleep. I've seen 6 specialist doctors and 1 chiropractor in the 4 years I've had this issue.\nDoctor #1 put me on steroids and said it would go away by itself in 1 year\nDoctor #2 gave me an EKG test and saw some failed nerves of the long thoracic. the test was performed with a needle which was inserted into my back , moved around and then repeated for an hour. Very painful. He also stated the pain would go away and that nerves repair themselves. he prescribed muscle relaxers. They made me very sleepy and it became hazardous to work/drive.\nDoctor #3 wanted to shoot me with steroids directly into the area of pain. I said no because I did a lot of research online and found it could have permanent damage if done so.\nDoctor #4 wanted to do another EKG test, I declined because that had already been done and did not go back to him.\nChiropractor #1 Cracked my neck and my back for 3 weeks, twice a week. and I saw no results.\nDoctor #5 said that I needed physical therapy, I did not attend because of failure in the past plus cost of treatment.

One moment, all is well. Then suddenly, a strange smell appears out of nowhere and stays, and all other smells, although detected, but become extremely distorted (usually pungent) e.g. a deodorant/perfume smell would feel much stronger than it really is and a bit different or pungent. This happens in both nostrils and in different frequencies, sometimes everyday, sometimes every other day, sometimes 2-3 times a week and so on.\n\nTriggers: Sharp inhale/exhale\nLaughing\nSneezing\n\nSometimes, I can feel that it is about to happen.\n\nRelieving factors: Only sleep. Otherwise, it stays even the whole day once it begins. But things become normal after I wake up. Then, a sneeze or other trigger can bring it back again for the entire day till I sleep again.

I would start with your primary care doc and ask them. But if they don't take you seriously or don't have any suggestions that work for you then you need to take charge. I was lucky in that my pcp was very familiar with tbi, but it was still a fight to find all the resources I needed. If your pcp is not familiar with this you need to ask around regarding who is in your area. One of my best go to ppl for referrals to physicians is actually the pharmacist. Maybe see if you can get 3 names...cuz even if someone is familiar, you need someone you work well with and feel validated by. Another great resource in the brain injury association in your state or a local center for ppl with disabilities. We also have a brain injury alliance in my state. You could try googling \"brain injury resources in (your city or state)\". They are established to help with this very thing. Personally I found craniosacral therapy to be essential. Also although I was virtually unable to function overnight after my injury, ppl (even these educated dr's I trusted) tended to attribute it to psych issues which was infuriating UNTIL I did neuropsychology testing which showed such severe issues in processing in virtually every area, esp compared with previous tests. I wish I had done this from the start because that is when the ball finally started rolling. I hope your dr will give you a referral for this. I pray maybe you have found help in interim and are being helped already but I know how flawed this process can be. As if the symptoms aren't enough to deal with in and of themselves, it's hard to imagine mustering the energy to access these resources, fight for access to them and be your own health care advocate, but if you don't have someone to assist you, that's exactly what you must do. I can only assure you that if you are willing to fight for yourself and your quality of life, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Do not listen to those who say that if progress isn't made in the first year it's too late. That's crap. I didn't get diagnosed properly until this year was over and I never dreamt I could improve to this extent. I feel like a miracle. I pray you find the help you need and are willing go to battle to reclaim your life. This isn't for sissies but I have faith in you. You can come out with so much more depth and wisdom than you had prior to your injury and see the silver lining hidden in this challenge.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/2379/postconcussive-syndrome"},{"post":{"author":"cheri64","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"In Pain","post_content":"I have had these weird sharp stabbing pains in my head that last about 3 seconds to 5 minutes followed by a burning sensation along with slight tingling in my head .

I was proscribed amoxicillin.\n\nThe headaches got worse and I had leg weakness and nausea in the morning for about 3 days.\n\nI ended up going to the emergency room. I got blood tests done which came back normal and a transvaginal/abdominal ultrasound which both came back clear.\n\nThis may seem confusing why they did stomach/transvaginal ultrasounds.

There was indeed tissue left over but tiny amounts that would not cause issues and would go away with my next menstrual cycle.\n\nThe headaches have continued (and doctors checking my ear after have all said there is no trace of fluid).

Congratulations on your new position. I hope that some of this information will be useful to you as you work with your doctor.\n\nIt sounds like what you are describing is a motor tic. Motor tics are usually short movements (like blinking) that happen during the course of otherwise normal behavior. They are not necessarily \"involuntary\" movements, but rather \"un-voluntary.\" This means that you might know it's coming, and you might even try to stop it from happening for a short time. But eventually the discomfort from trying to suppress the tic will grow until you blink.\n\nBotox has been used to help reduce motor tics in the face, and you will want to have a thorough conversation with your doctor about the risks and benefits, how long the treatment expected to help, and what you should expect after the procedure if you choose to proceed.\n\nThere are other behavioral and medication therapies that have also been used to help so you should talk to your doctor about all of your options and make the decision that is best for you.\n\nYou can check out this link for more information.\nhttp://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches#1\n\nGood luck on your new job!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/13524/do-i-have-an-eye-tick-or-is-it-just-a-bad-habit"},{"post":{"author":"daniel2017","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Silent Migraines or Something Else?","post_content":"Any help would be really appreciated on this one. Since last November I have been having issues with blurred vision that comes and goes on a daily basis. When my vision is clear it is 20/20 or better (tested at opto) and when it's bad I can't read a stop sign when it's right in front of me. I also feel fatigued and fuzzy when this goes on. My vision fluctuates throughout the day and can change very quickly (within a couple minutes). It is blurry to some degree about 80% of the time.\n\nIt all started in November of 2016 (no symptoms prior) when I had the worst migraine of my life. (I'm 26 and had migraines as a kid but was migraine free for 7 years before this). It started with visual aura and then led to incredible pain, blindness, numbness in my face and hands, fatigue, confusion, and eventually an inability to talk. I was able to speak words but they were random words, not what I wanted to say and then it got harder to speak until I couldn't speak at all. At the worst point I could barely stand and I was shaking very badly. A friend drove me to the ER on base (currently active duty) and they admitted me about 2 hours after this started. They thought I had done drugs (never have never will) so there was some delay while they did blood work to prove that it wasn't that. I was also throwing up the entire time. They did a ct scan and it came back clear on stroke, TIA, etc. so they sent me home when my symptoms began to get better (they gave me Benadryl).\n\nSince then, the blurriness has been a constant issue and I've been working with a military neurologist to figure out what is going on. They did MRI's with contrast to check for MS etc., conductivity tests, field of vision tests, and sent me to an optomologist for a complete checkup etc. but they have all come back negative/clear. The final verdict the neurologist came up with was silent persistent migraine with aura. I would be inclined to agree with this except that when the vision is blurry, squinting clears it up as does a lense. Yet when my vision is clear, it is crystal clear. I can push through the fatigue and the fuzziness but the blurry vision is killing me and impacting my work. Does anyone have any insight to this or does anyone have a similar story with a treatment?

Ive became sick in April 2016 and have not been the same since. I had mri, ct, blood work, stool samples, eyes checked , seen ent and everything came back good but Im far from good\n\nSorry for the long msg but this is affecting my life so much and here is a long history of how it all started\n\nApril 2016 I woke up one morning up to my work hotel (I work in another province) and it felt like I was drunk! Everything i tired to look at I couldn't. It was all a big blur. I didn't go to doctor until my left arm started to go numb and II couldn't focus on anything. Also my head was very lightheaded. (not sure if a coincidence or not but two nights before at work I got very cold, so cold in fact I couldn't talk proper afterwards for a little while. The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away. Before it went away I had very bad motion sickness which I never had\n\nA week later I returned home the symptoms came back (not s bad as initial drunk feeling) after I tried to clean my ears (or that's my guess). My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!!\n\nHad bloodworm done, ct scan, stool sample and everything came back good but I still felt lightheadness, and was off and hard time to focus. Doctors just though crystals in my ears were off\n\nWent to ent in August 2016. He finally explained that I didn't have vertigo as I'm lightheadness and I didn't have vertigo which is the room is spinning around me and all ear tests came back good. He couldn't understand why sec would work as to him it should be useless. He proceeded to clean my ears and removed a large chunk of wax from left ear.\n\ntwo days later my left side of my face and my neck went numb. Felt very weak. I went to doctor who then thought I had nerve damage from the cold and requested I see neurologist..\n\nI couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day\n\nTried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them\n\nSeen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri\n\nI continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst\n\nNovember 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also\n\nHad Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.\n\nI gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally\n\nI went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again\n\nI do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited\n\n\nAnxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part.\n\nIm just not sure what tests are going to be next.\n\nI am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year\n\nSorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far\n\nany suggestions greatly apppreciated","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/10784/ear-nerve-damage-or-anxiety-issue"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Cold sweat and dizzy","post_content":"Yesterday at the afternoon i went to bath after that i didn't wear my T-shirt yet soo i went out with no any shirts , and that night i eat my dinner some oily fish and eggs, just after dinner i use my computer i feel dizzyness i feel like turning around soo i turned off my computer and went bed that feeling turning around get worst and i get cold sweat all over my body soo i relax little bit and put some efficasint oil on my body and i feel very little bit good and drink some water, and i went sleep this morning i woke up feels tired something like never been before i wondering what could caused that been happened last night soo that i could avoid it to prevent it from happening again pls help...","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/10734/cold-sweat-and-dizzy"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Bad Habits That Can Hurt Your Brain","post_content":"Some things that seem fairly harmless can be bad for your brain.

Starting on the 9th, I took 22.5mg of mirtazipine and 25mg of clomipramine. Then on the 19th, 11.25mg of mirtazipine and 50mg of clomipramine.

I'm a 25 yo woman, healthy, I don't smoke or drink. I remember having headaches ever since I was a kid, ever since always taking OTC meds trying to control it. Three years ago I had a CT scan that came back clear and the doctor started treating me for migraine. Ever since I took different kinds of meds but I've never been more than 2/3 days headache free. In the last months I've been having daily headaches, my exception is when I'm not in pain. A new neurologist explained how migraine works and how he hardly thinks my case is migraine related, as my headaches are often in the same spot and they happen everyday. I'm having other symptoms that I don't know if are somehow related, such as lots of heartburn, difficulty in finding some words when I'm speaking, fatique and sleeppiness, rapid hearbeat sometimes even when I'm resting, these are some that I can remember of - overall speaking, I don't feel well all the time, this symptoms are really having a direct impact in my everyday life, specially at work.

Like I will tell my husband I love him 3 times in 5 minutes that I love him and not remember the first two times I told him. Or I will repeadiatly ask the same question over and over not remembering asking it or ever receiving an answer. My memory is consistently getting worse. The second thing is that every once and a while I will feel a numbness in the back of my head almost like the back of my head fell asleep. My hands fall asleep while im sleeping but also my arms and legs will get all tingly on and off through out the day. The third thing is my vision gets blurry but it almost feels like my blood pressure is going up at those moments and my eyes kinda burn. Those things I can deal with. But with the past year or so I have had some emotional/mood issues. Crying all the time or getting overly anger. Which I have really been working hard to get through. The worst of it that makes me really worry the most is what has been happening within the past 6 months and is getting more consistent is that I have been mixing up my letters and numbers.. for instance when I look at an \"a\" I will say 80. Today a customer wanted to know the weight of his motor oil. I kept saying it was fw-20 preferred but fw-30 would work too. I said it like 5 or 6 times and they were not understanding me and my boss said it was 5w-20 preferred but it could take 5w-30. They understood him and said oh ok. I started thinking about it and was wondering if I was saying \"f\" instead of 5 so later I asked him about it and I asked if I was saying \"fw\" and he said yes and he was trying to figure out what the hell I was saying. I really thought that I was saying 5 all of those times and in my head I was saying 5 but out loud I was saying \"f\". Also I was writing on the delivery driver board because we have to write on it where we are going to make a delivery. I went to go write vaughn on it but when I got to the \"n\" I wrote it upside down. Not a \"u\" But an upside down \"n\" like it was a mirror image. I also have been having a hard time concentrating on things. These are all very ccompletely out of the normal for me. I was suppose to get a cat scan a while back because when I went to go get my ears checked they layed me back on a table to check some things and she dipped me backwards and lifted me up quickly and she was concerned because my eyes moved back and forth quickly when she brought me back up.

In 1996, I had a schizophrenic breakdown, was put on Thorazine and Haldol and other ancient drugs with terrible side effects. My brain scan showed that I have abnormal left lobe activity. I also had breakdowns in 1997 and 2012, when off medication. About three years ago, I had several hours in which I was amazingly abnormally confused. I was asked at the hospital the name of my father, and I said something like \"January 29th.\" I vomited, had a brain scan, they told me it was not serious, just a migraine. My psychiatrist said it was not a normal brain scan. Then I had several terrible seizures in public in which I just blacked out and woke up a few hours later in the hospital. I was put on medication, which eventually worked, and I quit worrying. Then around Christmas last year I had a spell in public in which I could think fine, but I could not walk. I was staggering around and all I could do was sit down for another hour or so. I went to the emergency room, did my best to demand an MRI, and they told me flat out that it cost too much. I am on Medicare/Medicaid. That is government health care. They don't care. The doctor did that sign-of-the-cross thing before my eyes and told me there was no neurological damage. They told me I was dehydrated. Right after that I started having massive memory lapses. I still have them. They come and go. When I walk more than a little, my legs and occasionally my arms tingle and feel cold, and lately it becomes kind of painful, but goes away eventually. I started feeling nauseous about two months ago. I didn't vomit, and it got better, but about two weeks ago I did vomit all night. My bones ached too, so I think it was the flu, but I've felt more or less sick ever since. I went to the hospital for five days for an EEG screening for epilepsy, about a month ago. I had a grand mal seizure. I finally got an MRI, by begging, it took me six months. I learned I have a brain lesion in the left lobe, where memory is controlled. I was told I might have had it all my life. They aren't taking me seriously. Can I do anything about all this?

I hope this may be helpful to you as you work with your doctor to find the best way to manage your pain.\n\nThe good news is that it is very unlikely that the Botox treatment caused you any permanent nerve damage. Botox works by temporarily stopping the signal in between nerves and muscles. These effects wear off over time as the signal between the nerve and the muscle returns.\n\nIt is very important to work with your doctor to find out why you are having so much pain in your neck and the back of your head. Once you both have a working idea of what might be causing it, you can work on what can be done to treat it.\n\nPlease don’t feel like you are alone as you try to work through the pain. Think about keeping a headache diary to record the day, time, and duration of your pain. Also, see if you can identify things that might be triggers (like stress, foods, head position) and things that help (like massage, stretching, deep breathing, heating, icing). Bring this information with you to your next appointment so that you can come up with a plan to help relieve your pain.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/8761/botox-side-effects"},{"post":{"author":"rosslia","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Why does my head hurt every time I give a step??","post_content":"Every time I walk (give a step) specially a hard one, my head hurts.

The office will prescribe growth hormone in the form of an injection with a small needle that will make the medicine easy to give and almost pain-free.\n\nYou may want to talk to your provider about learning how to give the injection, where to give it, at what time of day, and how to store the injection in between doses.\n\nIt is also important to talk about your insurance to make sure that the injection that you are prescribed is covered.\n\nThe biggest thing you can expect after growth hormone treatment is growth, though it may take a few months to notice! You may find that your daughter is more hungry, outgrowing her shoes more quickly, and perhaps more thin as she grows in height.\n\nThis treatment works over the many years so expect to have a long-term relationship with her doctor and regular follow up for tests to monitor her progress.\n\nBest wishes to your daughter and thank you for playing such a major role in making her treatment successful!\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/5654/growth-hormone-defiency"},{"post":{"author":"missb_","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Headache, numbness, tingling, dizziness, vomiting","post_content":"1st going to the hospital isn't really an option(things have been rough let's just say heart attack, appendicitis, internal bleeding, cyst and root canals for husband and kids).

He didn't see any damage and referred me to a neurosurgeon. Neurosurgeon performed EMG test on both arms, 3-Day EKG test w/ video monitoring, MRI neck/brain & MRI w/ dye. Everthing still looks normal. So now get referred to a stroke/movement specialist. I take everything to him. Notes, xrays, MRI cds. He really has nothing for me.

Neurofeedback is a relatively new biofeedback technique that focuses on helping a person train themselves to directly affect brain function. Although it sounds like science-fiction in nature, it’s actually a reputable and scientifically-proven technique practiced by specially-trained psychotherapists. Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback, is a gradual therapeutic learning process that takes time and focus.\n\nAs the name implies, Neurofeedback works by providing feedback to an individual about their brain, specifically, their brainwaves. Feedback in a vacuum, however, is useless, so the individual undergoing Neurofeedback is rewarded for patterns of brainwave activity that are better for the person. This is referred to as “self-regulation,” because the individual is learning how to regulate their own actual brainwave patterns on their own, without medications or additional therapy.\n\nBiofeedback is a very unique process. It is not based on the conventional medical model, which is to diagnose and treat diseases and symptoms. Biofeedback works because it is based on a model of wholism.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/8690/neurofeedback-programming-the-brain"},{"post":{"author":"faisalkhanz","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Right side of body shrinking","post_content":"About Problem\nRight side of my body is shrinking progressively for more than 12 years at a slower pace. In the beginning at around 2006, I felt pain in my right leg whenever I stand in a posture to put more body weight on it. I could feel slight difference in both legs while walking or running etc. After some time same condition started in right arm starting from shoulder blade. Pain was also felt while taking support from right hand or while doing pushups. Right shoulder joint and muscles also appear less developed or strong than the left side shoulder joint and muscles. Same symptoms of shrinking and weakness appeared gradually in right hip and right jaw making it difficult to sit and lie down comfortably and chew hard items. Due to these symptoms, I believe, my back has also started to pain. Sometimes I feel pain in head or part of it. Neck often feels stiff and clicks when moved around.\n\nAbout Myself\nI am a 34 years old male.

I've had the whole range of tests done, but so far nothing conclusive has come up. Recently I began to experience symptoms similar to those of MS- vision problems, muscle weakness, trouble focusing and remembering words, tremors in my hands, frequent urination- and starting about two weeks ago I've been getting vertigo. It happens mainly when I'm walking, but also while sitting or standing still, and feels sort of like my eyes have suddenly unfocused without my permission. At first it was quick and infrequent, but its been happening more and more and become painful and more intense. I'll feel pain behind and above my right eye and moving to the left, traveling over the brow bone, and I'll feel nauseous and lose all train of thought. The swirling sensation lasts for a few minutes, and will repeat in waves if I try to move after the initial pain has stopped. Today it happened so abruptly that my knees gave way and I had to catch myself on a door frame to lower myself to the floor. It does seem to help if I focus on a single unmoving object?\nMy question is, how long do I wait before this becomes something that needs to be seen right away? I have an appointment with neurology coming up in a few weeks, but with the sensation getting worse and, frankly, scarier, I'm wondering if I should go into urgent care sooner than that.

MRI sometimes don't show CLARITY as to make an accurate reading this is because of ARTIFACTS. Google MRI ARTIFACTS and you will understand. ARTIFACTS, a metal plate in your neck, breathing, moving mouth, tongue, slightest movement can cause ARTIFACTS a distorted MRI, can be a computer program problem, many things can cause an ARTIFACT that causes an MRI to be easily MISREAD. This just happened to me after 23 years of CERVICAL problems. The next test being your symptoms continue is a MYLOGRAM. A Anesthesologist shoots dye into your spine and they tip you so that the dye goes through the entire spine and a CAT is done. If there is any spinal stinosis, herniation, nerve thats being compress, bulging discs this will definitely show up. My symptoms are numb neck, throat, tongue, forehead, head, arms, hands, fingers, chest, and terrible sensations in chest, breathing problems and loss of balance.You may not have all these symptoms because your problems aren't as severe as mine.

About two months ago I started waking up with my whole body feeling like it was shaking only to not be moving at all. I figured I was pretty stressed out with school so I dropped a class that was giving me a lot of stress and although I don't wake up feeling like I'm shaking violently I always still feel the shaking when I'm falling asleep and when I wake up. Related to this I believe are these muscle spasms I have which have started this month, seemingly random muscles that I didn't even know existed will start twitching completely out of my control for 10-20 seconds and then stop. These are new symptoms. I get dull aches in my arm once in a while as well. I also get this very weird sensation in the bottom of my heel that kind of feels like someone is sticking a pin into it, it usually comes while I am laying down. I have also had this new headache and it began about a month after the aforementioned symptoms and about one month ago. Well there are two headaches, the one on the rear left side of my head has been subdued recently but when it was at its \"prime\" it was a sort of sharp pain that would come for about twenty seconds and then go away for a while at random times. Sometimes in would make the whole left side of my head feel weird. With that same headache, when I lay down on the spot or put light pressure on the headache spot it will hurt but not as bad as the headache. The second headache I have only gotten twice and only recently. It is also in the back of my head and a little to the right of the first one. Both times it happened it was after I quickly moved my head to a different position. This was a very intensely sharp headache and one that I would describe as one of the worst I've ever had. Like I said I've only gotten it twice and it goes away after twenty seconds as well. I'm sorry this was so long but if anyone has any idea if these symptoms are related and what they might be please let me know.

One study shows that unstable weather conditions (fancy name for changing weather) increased frequency of seizures in the spring, fall, and winter (but less so in summer for an unknown reason).\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/5132/can-weather-cause-seizures-when-you-have-epilepsy"},{"post":{"author":"mohsan","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Info About the Type of Epilepsy","post_content":"Hi Everybody.\n\nMy name is mohsan and i am writing this post for my son who caught sudden and unknown illness.who is suffering with unknown type of epilepsy about 2 months.i try really hard to recovered his disease through best Nauru surgeons and different type of medicines,test ( EEG.CT) and doses but no use.doctors are also fail to diagnose.so Need urgent Assistance","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/5015/info-about-the-type-of-epilepsy"},{"post":{"author":"australianshepherd","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Face numbness, pain months after allergic reaction","post_content":"33 y/o male.

Responded quickly to Benadryl and prednisone.\n\nI don't know what caused it as it had been 5 hours since eating or drinking anything. I did have a beer and a pseudoephedrine for a cold before bed.\n\nAnyways, now months later, I still often have numbness, tingling, and occasionally soreness in the lower part of my face (down cheeks and towards mouth). It hardly ever gets above a 2/10 on a pain scale but it is bothersome.\n\nI've considered that it may be psychological (as in I started paying too much attention to normal body variations, because I was worried about having another reaction). And, I've also considered I might be exposing myself in a small way to whatever caused the initial swelling. I do think it's a bit worse for a day or two after drinking a beer, so I've stopped that altogether in case the allergen lies within.\n\nWould it make sense for facial swelling (angioedema) to have caused some damage that is just taking a while to heal?

Other than the times that I contracted pneumonia and mononucleosis, I have been in good health throughout my entire life. I was raised by a strict vegetarian woman, so I my diet choices are well informed (though I am no longer a vegetarian). I practice cardiovascular exercises and lift weights several times per week.\n\n10 months ago I began using my spare time and money to start my own business. I experienced a 3-month \"honeymoon\" period with this endeavor, after which my anxiety level skyrocketed. My anxiety has stayed at a relatively high level since then.\n\nProblem: Starting 4 months ago, a tension headache emerged for the first time in my life. While it does not remain in one particular spot, it seems to only occur on the top and sides of my head. It is not painful, but it is challenging to ignore, and it is affecting me on a socioeconomic level. It feels like there is pressure on my skull. Sometimes it feels hot. On occasion, it feels tingly, almost as if needles were very gently poking my scalp.\n\nThe tension headache is never present in the morning. It seems to present itself 10 - 60 mins after I awake. Sometimes its intensity increases throughout the day, and sometimes it remains very dull, but it is always present during my waking hours.\n\nSoon after my chronic tension headache began, my left eye began twitching. These twitches occur roughly every 10 minutes and last for a few seconds. The left eye lid often remains tense for minutes at a time, as if it was on the verge of twitching.\n\nI visited a chiropractor about these symptoms, and an x-ray showed a slightly misaligned C1 vertebra. The misalignment was so minor, it is hard for me to believe that it is the source of my tension headaches, though that may very well be the case.\n\n2 months ago, I began having involuntary muscle twitches throughout my arms, legs, back, and even strange places, like my inner right ear. These twitches are weak, meaning you wouldn't be able to tell if I was experiencing them unless I pointed them out while they occurred. The twitching happens every 5 - 60 minutes and normally last for 1 - 5 seconds.\n\nWhile writing this, I have a tension headache on the top of my head, closer towards the front (it started on the sides of my head this morning), and my left eye, legs and arms have twitched several times.\n\nNote: I have not had an MRI or CT scan done. My philosophy is that I should only do so if I experience cognitive defects, or if the tension headache becomes painful. I am seeing a neurologist next week.\n\nHas anyone else experienced these exact symptoms? If so, have you determined the cause?

Took the cambia again but it didn't help, took Advil,daily nortriptiline, muscle relaxers, more cambia. Called my neurologist after 3 days and they suggested going to the ER to get an infusion. It helped, until I stood up to leave. The headache was immediately back. This continued to go on, kept taking everything listed above. Two weeks into this unbearable headache, I saw my neurologist again, he for some reason checked my eyes and saw that my optic nerve in one eye looked larger and told me to call an opthamologist. I of course did and went to the appointment where he told me could not rule out that it was normal, but it also wasn't abnormal. So I called the neurologist with that, he asked me to come in to the office, thinking I had a pseuodotumor cerebri and wanted to do a spinal tap to check the pressure and take a sample. The opening pressure was 12. They then sent me for another infusion to help with the still unbearable headache. This was on a friday.This is now week three of this crippling headache. Fast forward to Monday, still unable to stand from unbearable presssure in my head, so bad I can't breathe, pulse racing. Call the doctor, they think it's an anuerism, rush to the ER. They run NO tests and speak with my neurologist who says it's from the spinal tap and says to give me an infusion and rest for 48 hours.

I attempt to drive home but make it ten minutes before pulling over and calling for help because the pressure in my head is so bad I can't see and I'm nauseous. I call my neurologist and he calls the ER to tell them I'm coming in for a blood patch. They do the blood patch, most painful thing I've ever experienced and actually pass out from the pain. Headache goes away and they send me home. Thursday, Friday, back pain but no headache. However extreme numbness in face, legs, and stabbing pains in feet if move a certain way. Saturday, extreme back discomfort, leg issues listed above, nausea and can't leave my bed.\n\nPlease help me or give me some idea what direction to go with this!

Also another thing about me, I'm not sure if it could be related but I get horrible wrist pains for years as well and it also just happens randomly even in my left (not dominant hand) they hurt to the point that I can't even bend them the slightest, they just get stuck. And you can noticeably see a difference in the way the veins and muscles in my wrist look when they get tense like this. They look very tight and potrude a little.

I've always been a \"small person\" and looking back at old class photos and comparing myself to peers (both boys and girls) I was always shorter, and smaller in every aspect (including head size), but it was never an issue because I was always of normal intelligence, and although my head was small so was my body so everything looked proportionate, and in many photos my head even looked too big for my body. However around the start of puberty I finally really began growing, until I soon started getting taller than my peers, and at my current height of about 5'9-5'10 I am about the same height or taller than most of my peers. However one thing stands out and that is my head size. My head went from being slightly too big for my body as a kid, to perfectly fitting my body to now too small for my body. It is currently 21 inches in circumference, which is in fact very small. The back of my head is flat, and my forehead slopes, all characteristics of a microcephalic (although I do have a very similar head shape to my father whom also has the slightly sloping forehead and flat back of the head, his head is way larger and looks perfectly normal). Everyone in my family has a large head. My sister, my brother (23 inches), my mom, my dad, my uncles, my grandfather, aunts, cousins, so I am very confused as to why my head is like this. Around 5th grade my vision started to \"deteriorate\" and I needed glasses and I feel like this is somehow related to my head size. I also have constant 24/7 ringing in my ears. My brother who has large hands and long fingers can grip a good portion of my head and this makes me feel even worst. My hands and body are now way to big compared to my head and I look so disproportional. 2-3 years ago I never got comments on head size and no one ever noticed anything, but ever since high school and puberty the small head is becoming more apparent. I feel like somewhere along the line my head stopped growing like it was supposed to and I have no idea what could have caused this. I also notice my face is very small and shorter in size than all my peers. everyone's heads seem bigger than mine and I wish I could get a diagnosis or something because I am pretty sure that by 16 the head is done growing, and most likely my head circumference will not grow that extra inch or inch and a half that would make is average sized.

Reading into it I was able to deduce that it was a natural side effect of deep meditation for some and thought nothing of it. However, for about the last week that sensation has stayed with me, even when not meditating all throughout the day (although much more pronounced during from the early afternoon until bed). It’s become bothersome, and I have stopped meditating thinking it will only make things worse. Is there anything that can be done to make this stop?

The left side of my skull, just above my temple, hit the player's lower thigh/upper knee, and I heard a large popping sound. After I tackled the player, my neck began to hurt severely, and I could not turn my head even the slightest amount to the right or left without excruciating pain to the upper left and right side of my neck. My head, which took the blow did not hurt and has not since the incident, and my neck has gotten slightly better with some stretching and rest, but I feel cloudy, and I am wondering if I got a concussion.

I've never had a seizure of any kind before this. I was sitting in bed with my wife and we had just finished a snack of blueberries and yogurt. My wife was headed to the kitchen and asked if I was done and was going to take my dish with her. I handed it to her and the next thing I remember being in a sleep like state with my wife trying to calm me down telling me it's alright and to let the EMT's do what they need to do. I remember feeling like I was having a nightmare and being frightened like I've never been frightened before. From the time I handed the dish to my wife and the time I came out of the seizure. So, jump back 1 1/2 years. My doctor switched me from Enbrel to Humira for psoriatic arthritis/psoriasis. Over the course of that year and a half I was slowly becoming more lethargic, lacking energy and feeling more and more depressed to the point that I didn't want to do anything or go anywhere. In addition to the Humira I had also been on Tramadol 50mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain and 2 weeks prior to the seizure I went to see my GP about how I'd been feeling. He had me taken a test for depression on a tablet and even though I tested on the low end for depression he decided to prescribe Prozac 20mg once daily. If that didn't help he was going to see me again.\nImmediately after the seizure I stopped the Humira and Prozac because of some things I'd read online. A week after the seizure I had my first appointment with a neurologist and she agreed with us on stopping the Humira and Prozac and diagnosed it as a \"provoked\" seizure and ordered an E.E.G. Once I had the E.E.G. she said she saw \"sharp\" waves and put me on Levetiracetam 750mg twice daily which leaves me feeling a little cloudy (btw, the E.R. doc put me on Phenytoin Sodium 100mg once daily which left me feeling like crap) and I hate it. I am self employed and since this all started I've been double & triple checking my work.\nAnyway, between the time I had the E.E.G. and the follow up with the neuro doc my rheumatologist said the Tramadol could have also contributed to the seizure so I stopped taking that and now manage my pain with OTC medication, mostly Tylenol.\nAt the E.E.G. follow up I asked the doctor if I should have another E.E.G. now that I was off the Tramadol and her response was \"there's no point\" and refused to order another one. Does this sound right? We live in Austin, TX and it's looking like I'll have to find a neuro in another metro area like Dallas to find a good neuro for a second opinion and before I start jumping through the hoops for that I thought I'd get a little input from others who may have suffered a similar situation.\nThanks in advance for any input and advice!\n(Told you it would be long!)

Tests that regular Drs run aren't the right ones. In today's world, they now have specialty tests to diagnose concussions. MRI's specific for concussions for example. Without seeing the proper specialist in concussions, Drs don't perform the specific tests for diagnosing concussions. So you are always sent to the psych Drs. And they assume you have a mental disorder. And are treated as such all the while you get worse. You may feel better for a while but then boom, meds don't work anymore, you've already progressed into the now long term side affects from your concussion(s). For me, there's no fixing the damage now. But they can try and relieve some symptoms and try to slow down the progression. But I'm only 48 yrs old. Been completely disabled since I was 40 yrs old. Now I can't function. Here is a small portion of symptoms...\nHeadaches; Feelings of Dizziness; Nausea and/or Vomiting; Noise Sensitivity, easily upset by loud noise; Sleep Disturbance; Fatigue, tiring more easily; Being Irritable, easily angered; Feeling Depressed or Tearful; Feeling Frustrated or Impatient; Forgetfulness, poor memory; Poor Concentration; Taking Longer to Think; Blurred Vision; Light Sensitivity, Easily upset by bright light; Double Vision; Restlessness\nIf you have three or more of just these symptoms, immediately go see a concussion specialist. The early diagnosis the more chance of full recovery, or better odds to fix a lot of the symptoms. Please remember, this is just the basics of symptoms. The more advanced/longer wait time to see a concussion specialist, the worse you will get. Believe me. I can't comprehend anything I read now. It used to be it was a huge problem but I'd at least get the concept. My anxiety is through the roof. I can't do anything by myself even though I have no one to help me. So that's my living nightmare. You develop compulsive behaviors; you do stuff without understanding the negative consequences. Like law breaking stuff; stealing, unsafe sexual behavior; sleeping around, prostitution, etc, fights, your behavior or your old self is no more.\nPlease read up on the brain and each section of the brain and what each sections job is. And it's all neurological. So you will also have physical problems of many kinds and areas. Remember this...the age you were at time of concussion(s), the severity of each concussion(s), what location(s) it affected the brain, and how many concussions you have had throughout your life.\nYou do not have to be unconscious ever to have endured a concussion(s). Almost all Drs still believe that, unfortunately. Yes, the majority of people recover from concussions, but the ones that don't...90 something percent of those people are misdiagnosed as psychological/mental illness/disease. And never get better for long. There are no meds to treat people with concussions. If you are sent to the mental side of Drs they will treat your depression if that arises or your anxiety but the meds will stop working if they even did to begin with. War veterans are treated for PTSD because yes that's a symptom but most of them if not all veterans have had at least one concussion. So they are being treated by the wrong Drs. You can sustain a concussion especially as a child from physical abuse; falls; car accident(s), numerous of things people don't think about. Please y'all do yourself a favor and do your research. Use current like 2016 reading material, books, cuz they have medical tests now that can confirm concussions. YOU have to tell your Dr the right tests. They won't automatically do them. Mostly cuz they are unaware.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Undiagnosed Concussion(s)","resp_content":"Someone else who does not want to take responsibility for their actions concussions have very visible symptoms I had several as a child still graduated with honors\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/1857/undiagnosed-concussion-s"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Am I the only One???","post_content":"A few months ago we found out that our neighbor had bedbugs, he told me that our landlord came over a few times in March, that is when he noticed he had bed bugs, he called them and asked for help with the situation and he said the help never came, I got upset at the fact that he let the problem go from March till we noticed them in our apartment, we now don't have any but the damage has been done, I have been suffering so much since April...

There were also 4 instances of having full body cramp that would come on rapidly and last 5 to 10 minutes - completely tight chest, pursed lips, full cramp in hands and calf muscles.\n\nThese symptoms resolved themselves in 3 months or so, but since then the symptoms have returned periodically (every 6 - 9 months) - but never as bad as I reminder the first instances in 2012. Over the past two weeks they have returned. Below is a breakdown of what I am feeling:\n\n- Muscle Twitching: constant and random across both sides bottom of foot, thigh muscles , groin, buttocks, upper arm, eyelids\n- Pins & Needles / Burning Sensation / Itching: random as above, itching extending to chest, back, and scalp. Nothing overwhelming, just annoying and I'm aware of it.\n- Numbness: twice I've experienced arm numbness, but more common in area around mouth / jaw / cheeks\n- Pain: occasional shooting pain in right kidney, left chest below the breakbone, and eyes ... again not overwhelming, but definitely aware of it\n\nI have some mild fatigue, but no loss of balance / coordination, no difficulty breathing or sleeping, no difficulties speaking. I am physically active and do not notice the symptoms when I am playing sport.\n\nI have seen three doctors between 2012 - 2014, with no firm diagnosis. Negative tests for HIV and diabetes, all clear on ECGs, no lesions showing on an MRI. In their view, this ruled out the most severe neurological diseases and I figure anything like MS / ALS would have manifested more strongly by now.\n\nThe only theories of note (completely uninformed and not made my doctors) are some kind of seafood reaction, a reaction to two surgeries I had just prior to symptoms starting (knee reconstruction and oral implants), or some kind of virus.\n\nAll of the above, I'm stuck for ideas and can go to a new doctor but worry it may yield the same result.

I basically increased my head pressure to my head by forcing it to show my classmates how I can “turn red”. That basically affected the oxygen that went to my brain and I fell to the floor, having a seizure for 30 seconds (that’s what my classmates said).\n\nAfter I woke up I didn’t feel the same. I had not been really smart or anything and my grades stayed the same, but I just didn’t feel myself. I don’t know where my head was when I hit the floor. I didn’t tell my parents, I’m now 17.\n\nI also have myopia on both eyes, which started around highschool but can’t remember when exactly. My left eye is worse than my right eye.\n\nI’ve been feeling perfectly well, I didn’t really see any big changes in my personality, and I’ve never been social. I have extreme social anxiety and I’m seeing a psychologist. My family is not very social and has problems, and I attribute my anxiety due to that fact.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I’m having a really small bump under my skin and above my skull on the left side of my head on the occipital lobe and I don’t know what it is. It’s really small and sometimes it’s “suddenly” itchy or painful I’m not certain if it feels hard or soft. When I shake my head quickly I can feel a shooting and small pain on the left side of my brain (a large potion of it) which I don’t feel on the other side, but I feel it inside my head. It might be due to stress because I have been extremely anxious and stressed to the point that I couldn’t sleep well, that was due to an urinary tract infection that I had over the last month and having it for so long made me anxious. I’m treating it with macrodantine and hiprex for 10 days, I’m on the 5th day.\n\nHaving said that, there are times when I am anxious or taking to a girl for example that I start to sweat on the right side of my head. Sometimes I feel jerks on any part of the body, but they are really occasional and I think they are caused because of the anxiety making my muscles too tense, because when I get home to sleep sometimes I have night tremors.\n\nI should also add that I’m a bit hypochondriac and I had an ecg done because I thought I had heart problems but I overreacted.
