This is going to be a bit long and embarrassing story. So please bear with me.\nI am a 35 year old male who grew up in a really traditional family in a really traditional country where talking about sex, or anything related to genital is a big taboo or stigma. So until a couple of days ago, I did not know that boys needed to retract foreskins and clean it daily to prevent infection. But my genital never felt itchy or pain or discomfort. This is how I stumbled into this: I have never had sex before, but I was desperate to find out what I missed out. So I bought a sex doll and applied lots of lubes before trying it on. The first time I thrust my genital into it, the toy pulled back my foreskin. Since the glans was never exposed before, it felt really sensitive. I did some online searching and it turned out to be normal. I could retract and put back my foreskin with no problem. After a couple of day, especially my glans started to feel natural when exposed, I decided to try the toy again. But this time my glans became big all of a sudden (within a few seconds) and it literally looked like a mushroom head. So even after my penis became flaccid I couldn't pull the foreskin over my glans. I was finally able to do that after maybe 15 minute of trying. Now I am scared and embarrassed.

I have no idea how or why I started doing it this way.\n\nBut basically I lay on my stomach, cupping my flaccid penis in my palm, and basically just hump and grind until I finish. The problem is, I can’t orgasm while erect now. Never have been able to. I’ve only ever had sex with a condom and I usually kind of fake it when I think I should be done (or after she’s done). I’ve only been with two girls, one was a serious relationship. And I never told them about this. I was my ex’s first (The girl from the serious relationship) so I don’t think she knew any better and didn’t know anything was wrong. The first girl I was with we had sex a few times and I think she was catching on after a while but we only had a short relationship.\n\nI can’t get an orgasm from receiving oral sex either. But now I’m single and I really think I need to get this figured out. This isn’t something I should keep doing. Especially if I want to get in another serious relationship, she’ll figure it out sooner or later. If I want to have children one day, etc. Oh and also the most important reason to get this resolved...because I’m sure everyone would agree: orgasming during sex is probably the best. Duh! I just hope I haven’t completely ruined my penis or something.\n\nI’ve tried plenty of times to orgasm while hard. Tried a number of things. When I’m aroused, I get hard. Just like everyone else. It feels *kind of* good to stroke it, have it touched, have sex, etc. But nothing really gets my heart rate going like I’m working my way up to an orgasm quite like the method I use. When I’m aroused, I wait until I calm down and get flaccid and then that’s when I do it.\n\nI don’t even know who I talk to about this. I don’t know what the problem is at all. Is it a complete mental block? Is it a physical issue and I’ve actually screwed my penis nerves up so much that this is what I’m stuck doing forever?\n\nI just don’t know where to turn.

Even as a teenager, it just wasn't anything I felt I had to do. I remember once back when I was in college; some of my friends had convinced me I should go out to a club of some sort. I did. There I was approached by two guys who were defiantly older than me. We were just talking and they seemed very pleasant. Then, after ten or fifteen minutes, they started bumping against me as they talked or touching my arm or my back or something. I felt it got weird so I had to excuse myself. I don't even notice guys as a rule. My co workers will start gushing about the nice looking guy that just came in and I honestly have no idea what they are talking about.\nI believe my husband also finds it hurtful I don't initiate sex.

He knows my darkest secret and tolerates my obsessive compulsive issues. He is the only person who has ever read my creative writing. To me, that is intimacy. However, lady, you have made me think. If he were to take up with someone, meetings would have to be planned. I wonder if he and I could make sex dates.

It's possible that you are asexual and you have no desire to be engaging in any type of sexual activity in the present or in the future. It's fine and it's normal as long as it doesn't bother you. Just like you don't want to have sex some people want to have a lot of it. Some people want to have sex with exotic props like toys or rope and ties for bondage and it's also not something you should stigmatize. For example me and my partner we are avid users of sex toys. We have an extensive collection of plugs and vibratos and different clamps. In general most of what we do behind closed doors involves some kind of toy or prop. (We usually buy them online on this really nice website: https://www.adultentertainmentstore.com/) They have a large selection of toys and they even have things you can't buy in other online stores like Amazon. But like what I wanted to say was that you should try to accept yourself for who you are and what you like and be positive, because there is no wrong answer in this situation.

It started out with the sudden appearance of two sort orange/pinkish aging spots on the head of my penis, which quickly grew into jagged lines that covered the front and sides of the head, but never reached the back for some reason. This was accompanied by random feelings of needle-pricking on the tip of my penis, and occasionally difficulty/a burning feeling when urinating. The needle-pricking sensation stopped not long after this, seemingly only being part of the start of the condition.\n\nThe condition plagued there for awhile, until I noticed that skin around my urethra opening was peeling off, about a centimeter from the hole all the way around. Not long after that these horizontal jagged and grooves started appearing on my penis head, but they are very infrequent. Showing up at most twice a week.\n\nIt platued there again until a few months ago, when the entire head would occasionally start burning and look red and irritated, which was sometimes accompanied by a sort of stabbing pain. It was also around this time that I started experiencing constipation, and the occasional pain when pooping.\n\nThe only improvement is that the total red/burning system doesn’t happen anymore, and the only burning feeling is from the urethra when I pee. Also, there are actually some days where my penis looks completely normal, but these never last more than a day every couple weeks.\n\nTerrified but lacking insurance and funds, I have not seen a doctor for this at all.

Hello all, I'm a 21 year old. Gender: male as you may have assumed. About a year ago I tried jelqing, a natural \"penis enlargement\" technique where you try to push blood flow into your penis and trap it there supposedly making it larger over time. In reality, I think it creates scar tissue which in a way does make your penis slightly bigger over time but of course is very damaging. After the last session, I had an ache in my shaft for some days. I quit cold turkey after that.\n\nI noticed a pretty significant loss of sensitivity but ignorantly figured it would just heal itself and regularly masturbated the next couple months. I noticed it took much longer than usual to ejaculate and harder to hold onto an erection. I had lost a significant amount of sensitivity and was having to heavily rub my foreskin to make anything happen. I started getting to a point where I had to wait a week between masturbation to successfully make myself climax. I know it was idiotic to continue this but at the time, I stupidly stayed optimistic and figured things would magically heal themselves. As a guy that always had a sub-average sized penis, I constantly got erections whether it was because I had to pee, my penis rubbed slightly the wrong way on my shorts, something pushed against it, etc would cause me a never ending erection to the point where I usually had some daily discomfort in my shaft from constant stimulation. I decided to believe that maybe this new lack of erections was a step in the more normal direction. After some months, I noticed even more sensitivity loss and quit masturbating completely. Its been about 5 months since I last masturbated.\n\nI've seen 4 different doctors (2 being urologists) and no answers.\n\nSymptoms: White spots on foreskin, less noticeable when erect b/c blood flow. A lot of spider veins. Entire shaft has almost no sexual sensitivity in it; the feeling of rubbing it can be compared to rubbing your finger; I feel it but no pleasing feelings/sensation. I sometimes get dull pain at the base of my penis, between the base and my pelvic floor only on the left side when I use the muscle for pushing out pee/poop. When I masturbated often after the injury I noticed pain in this spot except much sharper when I achieved hard erections and would pull my penis to my stomach to relieve it. The belly of my shaft, only on the half closer to the glands is my most sensitive area since the injury and seemed to be the least effected spot. I do still achieve erections while sleeping so I don't think it's a vascular issue.\n\n\nIf there's anyone that has experienced something similar, any advice is greatly appreciated. If you're going through what I'm going through, lets talk! I'll tell you things I've tried and vice versa. If anyone has any knowledge or idea of how I might regain some sensitivity, please share your thoughts. If there are any new procedures/techs out there you've heard of I'm open to any suggestions I can bring up to a new highly recommended Uro I'm seeing in a month.

They told me because of the antibiotics I took the other day results probably came negative. So at that point they put me on 14 days doxycycline.\n\nthat actually helped and my symptoms and pain, burning, discharge disappeared within a 4-5 days. I completed the doxycycline treatment. However burning pain went away, discharge etc went away, itching and constant needle rubbing like sizzling coming somewhere inside my urethra didn’t go away!\n\ni went back to doctor, same thing, urine sample negative but there is blood in there.\n\nThey put me back to doxycycline another 14 days, which didn’t do anything. Plus towards end of the treatment I started to feel fever and tenderness on my lymp nodes.\n\nI called the doctor let them know about it. They told me I should get a full panel STD test, which I did right away and results came negative. And they told me to wait 3 months and if the itch feeling doesn’t go away I should contact them again.\n\n(Also I noticed something odd with the look of my penis that I didn’t have before all these happened. I noticed small white spots on the bottom middle of my penis, it’s a group of them round and almost looks like folling a line towards the tip on the head. Which later doctor told me they are pearly penile papules.)\n\nA month after I decided to go to another urologist at that point.\n\nThey took a urine sample, results came negative but they told me there is blood in my urine sample so doctor will further examine that.\n\nDoctor ordered abdominal CT Scan, blood test for kidney functions and a cystoscopy.\n\nCt scan and blood test came good, cystoscopy; she said I had a minor structure before the globe. She told me to wait another 4 months and follow up, because cystoscopy sometimes treats the stricture.\n\nItchy feeling disappeared after the procedure but came back a week after.\n\nIt’s constant and never ending. I tried different diets, and eating habits, nothing makes it lessen or worsen.\n\nSo, 4 months after, around the time I am going to reschedule a follow up visit my health insurance changed with the new enrollment period and I couldn’t go to the same doctor because they wouldn’t accept my new insurance.\n\nI found another urologist covered under my new insurance.\n\nI brought him all my medical records gave him a detailed scoop of the story.\n\nSame thing over there with my urine sample, everything negative but there is blood in my urine.\n\nFirst he put me on anti inflammatory pills for two weeks and scheduled me a visit right after that.\n\nAnti inflammatory pills didn’t do anything. So he scheduled another cystoscopy to see if the structure still exist or if there is anything else.\n\nAfter the cystoscopy he said there is no stricture and everything looks okay.\n\nAt this point he thinks that my brain makes the itchy painful sensation and having blood in my urine may not always mean there is something wrong with me.\n\nSo he put me on antidepressant pills and told me to not to worry about it perhaps itching and pain will go away with time.\n\nSo this is where I am now. I am not taking any antidepressants pills, I am refusing it to do so. I don’t think my brain is jacked up and if there is blood in my urine there is something these doctors are not taking the extra mile to look in to.\n\nI am clueless and if I have to take those antidepressants I am going to take it because of my desperate situation.\n\nBecause it effects my daily life, gives me mood swings and I don’t feel any sex drive constantly thinking I still have something going on and I don’t want to infect anyone.\n\nPlease share your thoughts, past experiences or comments, what next step I should take?\n\nIs there other tests that I could take to get bottom of this?","like_count":"0","tags":["Chlamydia","Men's Issues","Gonorrhea"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Never ending Itchy Feeling post STD","resp_content":"Hi If your getting depressed keep off the drugs, get on to meditation, the mayo Clinic rates meditation as a far better tool, plus the side effects of some SSRI's is ED, this you don't want. so find a local group and get into the art of meditation.\n\nDo you have a local sexual health/GUM clinic? if yes get round there and see what they say, remember STI's and STD's is there field of work, if there is something there they should get to the bottom of it for you, just tell them your story.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"nicky49","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Never ending Itchy Feeling post STD","resp_content":"If there is a chance you may have gonorrhea​, according to the CDC there is an antibiotic resistant strain.

There is obviously a strong genetic risk for me so am concerned about my risk in the future.\n\nI am seeing conflicting reports about the frequency of ejaculation and prostate cancer risk.

The prostate gland is a sex organ. It produces a liquid that is mixed with sperm to make semen. Testosterone is a sex hormone produced by the testicle and the prostate gland needs testosterone to work. It was thought in the past that having higher levels of testosterone in the blood may increase the risk of prostate cancer. But, in 2008 an analysis of 18 separate studies found no link between levels of sex hormones and prostate cancer risk.\nRead more at http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/prostate-cancer/about/prostate-cancer-risks-and-causes#6l1lPF8ybLll6iJt.99\nIts not so much toxins in your prostate we get toxins in all of our body, and having sex is far better for us than masturbating as this releases endorphins all around our body’s so better and more healthy for us, but you are in the league of over masturbating which has other side effects.\nSo the side effects of over masturbation is. nerve trouble, hair problems, eye floaters, skin problems, memory problems, penis shrinkage followed by lose of erections during sex and last of all, the real bad one is ED, (erectile dysfunction) and this you don't want.\nNow I have a mix that could help if your interested, for prostate health help fight cancer good for your heart and more.\nJust come back to me.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"cmw1979","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"I have a girlfriend and we have sex at least once per day when together.

I have always had average to loose testes and scrotum; shrinking in the cold or during arousal, but only to a very \"normal\" level. the primary method of developing my core/abs is with pul-ups/chin-ups, hanging leg-lifts from a chin-up bar, and long free hangs from a chin-up bar with a focus on oscillating from the lowest (most deep) hang, to exhaling as deeply as I can which tightens my lower ab muscles to such a degree that my legs automatically raise up forward a little by about 15% to 30% depending on how deep an exhale I achieve... Ever since my core/ab development has gotten so good, I have noticed that my testes and scrotum get extremely tight when cold and even more so when aroused. Sometimes when my wife is riding me during intercourse, one or both of my testicles actually recess up into my very low pubic regional (flanked on either side towards the top of the base of my erect penis). I find myself needing to push them back into my scrotum and occasionally, or simply having to change positions. After ejaculation, my testes and scrotum relax back into a normal \"hanging\" level. I have searched and search and cannot find a correlation between well developed abs and tight testes/scrotums. I have checked Porn Hub out of curiosity to see what the prevailing testicle/scrotum situation on guys with extremely developed cores/abs look like.

Two days passed, and this opaque thick white stuff appeared on my testicles and had a not so pleasant smell. I took a shower, and all the dryness I experienced was gone (I though maybe the skin peeled itself off). However, this happened again a few days ago. I took a shower again and it was gone.\n\nAbout two days ago, I decided to buy an over the counter anti fungal cream (Lotrimin). I thought the opaque white stuff was some thing like a yeast infection or scrotal dermatitis because I tuck (look it up) my penis daily for 24+ hours a day (on top of when I work out), so I thought the very moist environment of my genitals being squished together caused this. The same day I bought the anti fungal cream, a red non painful bump appeared on the base of my penis. I just assumed it was part of the yeast/jock itch thing.\n\nHowever, I started to look up different STD's and I am scared it could be more than just a yeast/jock itch/scrotal dermatitis infection.

OK\n\nHow do I get herpes?\n\nHerpes is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact. You can get herpes from touching someone else's skin that has herpes, including:\nKissing someone with a cold sore\nOral, anal and vaginal sex\nTouching any area infected with herpes\n\n\nYou can get herpes even if you can't see it. Genital herpes can be transmitted sexually both when a person has noticiable symptoms and when they don't.\n\nWhat does herpes do to my body?\n\nMost people don't know they have herpes. You can find out that you have herpes a few days or as late as years after getting it. Herpes usually affects the mouth and the area around the penis or vagina, buttocks or upper thighs. Some signs of herpes are:\nBlisters, bumps, or pimples on the infected area that crust over\nFever\nHeadache\nPain while peeing\n\nHerpes sometimes looks like bug bites, rash, jock itch, zipper burn, razor burn, irritation from sex, or yeast infection. It is easy to confuse symptoms of herpes with these types of symptoms. The only way to know if you have herpes is to get tested.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Thanks for the replies.

Also, hair does not grow where the bump is on my penis, so I do not see what could irritate that. Other than that, I have no symptoms, but I had read most people are unaware of theirs.

Ive been having issues with my menstrual cycle, pretty much, ever since I started having them.

I couldnt keep track of my periods (it would just start out of no where with no signs or symptoms) and it would last 2-3 weeks. I actually had a few that lasted for 4 weeks. I saw my GP about it and she put me on birth control to straighten it out. It seemed to work for a while, but then I started having \"break through bleedings\" (Bleeding while your taking the pill and not supposed to bleed). We tried a different pill and that worked for a bit and then it didnt so we tried another pill and that worked, but then it didnt so the doc started upping the dose. I was on a high dose of sprintec and I still started bleeding through. I went to a regular gyno and she put me on the lo-lorestin pill and said it would work and this was the best pill she has worked with. I havent even been on it a year and I had a \"break through bleeding\" last month and then another at the beginning of this month (October). It started off as spotting, but has worked up into regular bleeding. The current week is my \"period week\". After this week I will have been bleeding for about 3 weeks.

Am going absolutely crazy with worry :(","post_content":"Ok so let me tell you a story. Apologies for the length\n\nThursday 14th March i met a lady that id been talking to for months and met a couple of other times just socially, we met and had lunch..and we booked a room in a place with a private booth. Now before i went in the booth i went into the toilet and washed my penis with some handwash that was in the restroom (haha stupid i know!) that was strongly perfumed on the sink and was dark orange in colour..i put lots on all over the head of my penis without even diluting it with water! and to be honest don't think i washed it off properly...i did rinse a bit but not fully and some stayed on my penis head\n\nAnyway things got heated and she ended up with my penis in her mouth for around 10 seconds..that was it. I also put my fingers inside her vagina. Nothing else happened on the day apart from LOADS of kissing, deep french tongue kissing (literally loads)\n\nSo the next day (Friday), i notice a bit of a painless rash on my penis head, like little spots or pimples. Now to add another dimension to this i have suffered from a fungal jock itch condition in my groin, and i am constantly constantly scratching it...ive suffered with this on and off for years..and might well have scratched and then touched the head of my penis inspecting it etc (i was inspecting it and pulling the foreskin back a lot on the Friday)..Saturday the spots started to fade..by Sunday they had completely gone and then on the Monday morning i noticed a little bit of burning near the opening and right underneath my peehole. NO other symptoms..nothing on the glans. So i spoke to her and she is mortified...she had a coldsore a week earlier that had dried up and dropped off and completely healed 2 days before we met(she even went to the pharmacist earlier that week and the pharmacist said it had completely healed and there was nothing there (as we wanted to kiss loads)..she had no symptoms of anything, she has had no sexual contact since last October (with her husband) and she split with her husband at In January (due to him being unfaithful)..again with no symptoms of anything\n\nSo i got some canesten (thrush cream) and been putting that on, Smothering it all over and the burning although its not really burnining was just a slightly uncomfortable feeling, had been getting better..but now i think smothering my penis in canesten has also made it a bit sensitive..there is a slight bit of red irritation, no lesions or anything. So i go to the doctor...he takes a look and says this is nothing to do with herpes (i exlained everything to him) and that i have dermatitis. So gives me some Daktakort..i dont read the instructions and smother my penis head in it...which seems to make it worse...as in red dots under the glands skin (nothing raised) when i squeeze it, like little dots or blood vessels. I then read instructions and apparently you are only supposed to put it on thinly as it thins the skin and can cause irritation.\n\nIn the meantime i go for an STI screen (two weeks after the 14th)..see the sexual health nurse who explains..the encounter was a risk..but a low one given the circumstances..she looks at my penis under a spotlight and cant see any lesions and says dermaitits is likely due to the stupid idea of putting strong perfumed and probably alcoholic handwash all over my penis and says with all the anxiety and stress if sores were going to come out they would have by now...and that also a lot of my symtpoms could be down to stress and anxiety\n\nOf course all this time my anxiety is going through thew roof..every little itch, feeling of warmth is amplified by ten. I was getting some warmth and a burning sensation between my scrotum and anus..no lesions or rash..but i do sit all day...so started to think i had prostate problems due to stress\n\nHave now started putting the daktakort back on and it feels slightly better but it still looks like there are tiny red small dots under the skin of the glans...and it still burns slightly from time to time with an occasional itch. Ive never felt ill, never got the flu...dont ever remember having a coldsore in my life and i am absolutely going out of my mind that i have herpes..it's causing me some serious mental strife!...If i am still getting these mild symptoms will go back to the doctor but the stress and worry is killing me. Anyone had similar? Or like everyone else do you all think i am worrying over what is a low risk encounter and my syptoms are driving me crazy in my own head and making the dermatitis worse\n\n\nThanks All\n\n\nGordy\n\nx","like_count":"0","tags":["Genital Herpes"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"11 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Possible Genital Herpes?

We had met a couple of times before very briefly. We met, had lunch, a few drinks, there was lots of kissing (open mouth tongue kissing). I had booked a private booth in an underground bar. Before we went in the bar i went into the toilet/restroom and on the sink was some heavily perfumed and coloured handwash..i put lots in my hand and rubbed it all around the head of my penis (didn't even dilute it) and also dont think i washed it all off properly\n\nAnyway inside the private booth lots and lots of heavy kissing, i also put my fingers inside her vagina and also my penis was in her mouth for about 10-15 seconds..that was all.\n\nThe next day, i notice small painless red bumps on my penis, like little red dots, around 8-10. Now..i also was suffering from a fungal infection in my groin, like jock itch. I was constantly inspecting my penis on Friday the day after and its totally possible i scratched my fungal infection then touched he head of my penis.\n\nOn the satarday the spots had started to fade, by Sunday they had virtually gone (again all the time maybe scratching my fungal infection and touching my penis head), then on Monday morning i noticed a very slight burning near my peehole and just underneath it, Tuesday it was still there..its not painful when i pee but i can feel the heat a little bit more than usual. So i tell the woman..she is mortified that i am worried about this..her only sexual contact was back last August with her then husband who she split with in November, she is not a promiscuous woman. (she has also gone back and asked her husband about symptoms of anything of which he has hsaid he's not had symptoms of anything and never has) Also...she had a tiny coldsore on her lip..that had completely healed and dropped off the week before we met..she even went to see the pharmacist who confirmed there was nothing there and she was not contagious (because we wanted to kiss). She has no symptoms whatsoever of anything\n\nI have gone and got some canesten/thursh cream and have been putting that on, it is getting better but i am now thinking by smothering my penis head in canesten it is making it even more sensitive lol..\n\nI have no other symptoms, i feel well, no visible marks or anything on my penis or the penis head, no disharge that i can see.\n\nIt it possible it may still be the irritation from the soap getting into the urethra, or maybe i have transferred some bacteria from my fungal infection?

I just want to ask about my situation, if it sounds more like I have herpes, genital warts, or something else. A month ago, my partner noticed some flat, blisters around my anus. There was also one, tiny, red bump on the hood of my clitoris (it didn't really feel painful or anything, but I could definitely tell there was some mild sensation upon touching it). After a day or two, the blisters occurred on certain areas in my vulva, including one on my pubic region. All of the lesions really hurt whenever I moved/walked and it caused a burning sensation during urination. We suspected it was herpes, also because a day before we noticed the lesions, I also had flu-like symptoms for 2 or 3 days. However, when we went to a hospital to get it checked from a doctor, she told me it was definitely genital warts. She also suspected chlamydia/gonorrhea/yeast infection and gave me a prescription for it. She told me to come back after a week and shave the pubic hear to see how it goes because she recommended me to go for cauterization. However, what I read from my research was that genital warts are not usually painful. After a week, the blisters were still there and caused discomfort, but immediately right after I shaved my pubic hair, the pain literally went away in an instant, and it felt normal walking/running. I came back to the doctor after that and she seemed sure it was genital warts. I was really confused because from the readings I've read, it pointed more to herpes, and from where I am, it is difficult to get tested for both herpes and HPV infection. After three weeks, the blisters became flat. A cluster of small ones developed little scabs, but the rest of the blisters didn't have scabs and just looked like round scars. I went to another doctor and she was not sure what it was, and aside from the STIs I mentioned, she pointed out to other conditions such as folliculitis and yeast infection blisters. She also prescribed me with neo-penotran as a suppository for my abnormal discharge. It has been 7 weeks now and all I have are the scars from where the blisters occurred.

I was maybe 70% erect but was able to have sex with my fiancé. There was no bounce-back for a second round, though. For the next couple of days, three scenarios unfolded: 1) I'd be erect enough to have sex, but it wasn't normal; 2) I'd be erect enough to penetrate, but I'd lose my erection during intercourse and would have to stop; 3) I couldn't even get it erect enough to try intercourse.\n\nI viewed porn, figuring there was some issue with sex (stress, emotions, maybe I was more tired than I wanted to admit, maybe I wasn't quite in the mood, etc.). Still, the same thing. A partial erection.\n\nI have had zero morning erections. No partial, random erections during the day. This quite likely appears to be a physical issue.\n\nI remembered that about 2-3 weeks ago, right before my issues started, I stupidly stretched out and twisted my flaccid penis. Also, when it was erect, I bent it back toward my body. Now, I've done both of these things throughout my life. Why? I have no idea. I found on another site someone likening it to cracking your knuckles; just an odd idiosyncrasy.\n\nThis led me to the term \"broken penis\". Now, other than a soft erection, I don't believe I have or had any of the symptoms associated with this term broken penis. I did not hear a pop when I did it; it did not hurt at the time, nor now (maybe a little pain, but I've also been masturbating with a partial erection, trying to get it fully erect, so maybe it's just sore from doing that lately). There's no discoloration, etc.\n\nI am scared to death that I will not be able to have an erection again or have sex.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience, suggestions, questions? I guess my question would be, if it is a broken penis, is the damage irreversible? I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled, so hopefully I can get some answers at that time, but I am beyond stressed out in the meantime and am just trying to get answers or other people's input if they've experienced anything like this.

I suppose she was having a guilty conscious and told me that she was recently diagnosed with HPV when she had her yearly pap smear so she had to have gotten it within the last year.

I have been sexually active with multiple partners since and hsven’t noticed anything particularly abnormal, though sometimes I can talk myself into thinking I do.

And it seems like only women can be tested for it? Is it possible I could have it and keep passing it to others without ever knowing if I have it?

I am a 25 y.o. male and usually wake up with a morning wood and get multiple erections throughout the day. A few days ago, I woke up and my penis was not only flaccid, but had also shrunk considerably. It is maybe a third of its normal flaccid size. It has become very soft and when touching it, it feels 70% numb when compared to normal. I have not had an involuntary erection in almost a week and I am unable to have sex. If I try to masturbate with extreme speed it expands, but only to the normal size of my flaccid penis, not even close to my usual erections. I went to the ER and to a walk-in clinic, where both doctors basically told me to wait a few weeks and said that it might be due to stress. However, I have not been stressed at all lately, quite the contrary. An X-ray of the lower back / pelvis showed no signs of injury. I do not drink or smoke and exercise routinely. My gut feeling is telling me that this is something completely physical, not psychological. My only lead is that I had a lower back pain a few days ago due to moving stuff around the house, but it is now gone. I would be very grateful if anyone has any ideas or suggestions.

OK\n\nHi Guys this is my main mix for you blood and take this most days of the week, and as you see its very good for a few other things all researched.\n\n\nFor a start this mix is a great way of cleaning away cholesterol plaque from our blood, and helps control triglycerides and keep your numbers right, and will improve your erections.\n\n\nThe way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric with black pepper and garlic, take this each morning and see how you go.\n\nFor each heaped teaspoon of turmeric you add a ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper, this helps the turmeric to get absorbed into your system better.\n\nThe whole mix its all very healthy for you.\n\nYou just mix CP and Turmeric and BP 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil, at first you just mix this to a heat ( this the heat that CP gives off) that suits you, and over time you can slowly increase the CP and Turmeric.\n\nTake the turmeric and BP as 50% of the 50/50 mix. OK\n\nYou take 3 teaspoonful’s each morning first thing, you wash each spoonful down with water, before anything else just after you get up, one thing it will warm you up with this mix, which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic, just do a whole head, chopped fine, and keep in olive oil, with this you add dried parsley, a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix, you can also add dried oregano, you just add a teaspoonful on top of the CP an turmeric mix, just mix into the top take as said.\n\nThe Parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your Cholesterol down, you can also add some oregano in as well as its good for erections.\n\nPlease do keep both jars in the fridge, keeps a lot better that way.\nA good tip is do not fill you jar to the top leave about half an inch, its the tomato paste it expands from the olive oil, it then push's red oil out of the jar, and loves to explode out from under the lid as you open it, messy.\n\nNow if you google and read up about all above, there very good for ED, your cholesterol, heart and it clears blocked arteries and veins, good at lowering HBP, prostate, prostatitis, varicocele and RA, garlic is also very good for your blood, so along with the CP and turmeric with BP, your be doing your body the world of good.\n\nTurmeric is a great way of fighting and lowering your triglyceride numbers when you have high cholesterol, and turmeric is also a way of fighting certain cancers.\n\nTurmeric has some fantastic uses, you will be amazed at, like so many herbs and spices do.\n\nNow if your on any kind of blood thinner's don't take the Turmeric as its a blood thinner as well, means your blood will get to thin.\n\n\nAt first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day for 2 weeks then just 2 times once first thing and the second before a meal for 2 weeks, then just once a day first thing in the mornings, great way to start the day.\n\nAnd yes have had ED now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone.\nSo do hope this helps you.\n\nGood Luck\n\nNOWHARD\n\nPS This really needs a 12 week trail, to see if its going to work for you, if its for RA do increase it up, the stronger it is the better it works for you.\n\nDon’t forget to up the amount of CP and turmeric as you go on.\n\nNow for me, these days as its almost around 7 years being on this mix, I do a standard mix which has 4 rounded desert spoons of cayenne pepper and turmeric in it, and l mixed up, then daily I put some more olive oil on the top, add the 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper then a heaped teaspoon of CP and the same of turmeric add on the heaped teaspoon of garlic and mix this in the top layer and I now take 4 teaspoons of the mix, some days it can get me but most days I'm ok\nas for supplements its L-Arginine Tribulus, L-Carnitine, DHEA and just some daily vits, but I do wash them down with a boric acid mix, boric acid has the tag of being the poor mans Viagra, a standard mix is a 1/4 teaspoon in a litre of water and drink through the day, I mix at a bit stronger as I only take it first thing in the mornings, but as they say every little helps .\n\nBe warned some days my mix will make your stools a bit on the lose side, it does me, but I do not worry over it.\n\nThe last piece of info is I do have ground down green tea, with ground down natural Tribulus which I can buy here in Greece I can make a teapot last 2 days by just adding some extra, then have 2 days on black tea, I drink both with honey and lemon two more things that are very good for your blood, of a night I have 2 squares of 70% bark chocolate, something else that's so good for your blood, I think like I have said above get your blood working for you, and your about 2/3 of the way to getting some really good erections.\n\nI don't think this is in here but have warn a *** ring 24/7 just after things was getting better just to give that extra hardness, I have a Hardwear Ice from my hardwear, its a Pyrex full package ring, great to wear.\n\nI get good nocturnal erections that wake me up, and lots of morning woods not bad for a guy who will soon be hitting 70.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"chrischesterton","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Penis Pain","resp_content":"Try using a creme called Man1 Man Oil.

About 4 days ago I've noticed a small pain in the right of my pelvis while I was masturbating , the pain was dull but the day after I masturbated twice at an interval of about 4 hours. The second time there little semen and transparent watery liquid which has happened before but with no pain. I've google some stuff and I think that this pain is because I masturbated to frequently and should cut/pause masturbation for around 6 weeks. It doesn't hurt that much and the pain usually occurs when I get and erection and / or I start masturbating , but it goes away half the way to finishing , I've never ejaculated after I felt the pain. I've started masturbating today but didn't finish after thinking of the consequinces , after 10 minutes my right side of the pelvis became a little numb and it hurt a bit, but the pain stopped right after. I'm going to be cutting on masturbating 2-3 times a week now and I'm definetely scared about my future sex life. Got some advice and answears on this question ?

The likely cause is an overgrowth of anaerobes — bacteria that don’t like oxygen. This infection,called non-specific bacterial vaginosis, may occur after you take antibiotics that wipe out normal oxygen-liking bacteria, after sex that changes the vaginal PH (although this is not a sexually transmitted disease) or for reasons unknown. It can be treated with a local antibiotic vaginal cream containing metronidazole or ovules of clindomycin.\n\nSo for me I would say start using coconut oil 4 times a day around and inside your vagina, try sex with and anoint you guys penis with it and see just how sex goes then, but take it slowly.\n\nCoconut oil is very good at fighting YI's and very good as a sexual lubricant, your get lots of slip, and it is an antibiotic oil.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"willcampbell8877","resp_time":"8 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Painful Sex","resp_content":"Sorry to hear that you're struggling with pain.

Frequent Urination, Penile Retraction, Rare Sharp Urethra Sensation when Urinating, Rare Hard to Describe Pains","post_content":"So this has been an issue that hae plagued me for over half of my life and has resulted in terrible depression and a very poorvmental state. I beg of anyone to please take the time to read this post in its entirety and give advice or get it from an expert that could help. I'm currently a 24 year old Male. Around the age of 12-13, I was masturbating and tried to urinate in the middle of the process. I don't know why I did this at the time, I just remember do this. I was pushing out very hard in order to force urine through the erection. I looked down and saw a little blood come out. I stopped immediately. The next time I tried to masturbate, I felt a very sharp pain upon ejaculation. Ever since that moment, I started having the urge to urinate more frequently and I was always able to with ease. I also noticed that a small brown dot formed on the head if my penis. It's so difficult to explain what it felt like but it was almost as if my bladder wouldn't even hold urine, and that the urine would just go straight to my penis. My penis was also always going into a retracted state when I had to urinate or make a bowel movement. I also noticed I had this new ability to just keep pushing small amounts of urine out, which mainly occurred during bowel movements as I was already sitting on the toilet. Continuously doing this would greatly flare up my urethra and make it feel as if I needed to urinate even If i had already gone. It wasn't that bad at first so I didn't even realize anything was wrong. Through the years of puberty, my penis would on rare occasions go through periods of throbbing, specifically in the urethra area and almost always at night before bed. My penis also never really grew much during these time and it seems as if it's the same size as when the incident happened. As the years went by, the frequency of my urination got worse and worse and I was kind of living in denile because I was afraid to ask someone about it or go to a doctor to talk about my issues \"down there.\" My freshman year of college, I was probably 18 or 19 and I finally got the courage up to say something to my mom. I thought at the time \"Oh I must have a UTI\" after doing a few minutes worth of research, so I ended up going to my family doctor and tested perfectly healthy. My family doctor ended up referring me to my first urologist. The urologist did a bladder ultrasound to see if I had any urine remaining in my bladder after urinating for him and he saw none. He figured I had some type of overactive bladder and put me on a medication for overactive bladder with directions to come back within a month. Well the overactive bladder pills did absolutely nothing for me and I ended up not returning because I was just so afraid of talking to someone about this issue. Fast forward about 5 years and I'm in my final year of college. My mental health is in peak decline. I'd been afraid to approach woman my entire life at this point due to my issues down there. It's also worth noting that the frequency of urination was at a point where I would ejaculate urine during periods of masturbation. This is one of the biggest issues I have with this main issue as it makes sexual intercourse a very awkward experience if I'm ejaculating urine from having to pee so badly after having just urinated 10 minutes ago... So I decided to try another urologist. This is where things go serious. Ended up getting a penile/bladder scope. It was a brutal procedure, I thought there's no way it could ever get worse than that. The nurse had to hold me down. This is where I thought for sure they would find something wrong, only to my mortification, it looked perfectly fine. I ended up getting put on another couple overactive bladder pills for month long periods all to no avail. Finally, they decided to do Urodynamics on me where they fill up my bladder and monitor the release. I was wrong about how it couldn't get any worse. I still have PTSD of sorts after getting the urodynamics done to me. Holy heck, that was brutal. I remember my urethra getting so flared up that I had to pee within 5 minutes and it was super hard to urinate in the position they had me sitting. I was sitting as I had almost passed out from the process of having the line pushed up into my bladder. The urologist determined from the results that I should have incisions made to my bladder neck which is typically only done to older men (I'm only 24). This procedure would prohibit me from ejaculating and greatly complicate the rest iprocedure. I have no desire to live life like that as a Male. I ended up going to a 2nd urologist in down in Columbus, OH and he was very surprised by hearing that this other urologist wanted to make bladder neck incisions due to the fact that I'm fairly young. This new Columbus urologist ended up putting me on a couple more overactive bladder medications that did nothing. He seemed really confused and ended up setting me up with a Pelvic Floor Therapist before deciding on moving forward with any procedure. It's now worth noting that none of these urologists spent much time at all drilling me with questions about what was wrong and none of them were very personable at all. The Pelvic Floor Therapist that I'm currently seeing was totally different. She spent the first session asking me a million different questions for nearly 2 hours which made me feel like she really cared. She also has me filling out bladder diaries (daily charts showing exactly when I'm peeing) which I was very surprised that the urologists had never done before. The therapy involved her trying to loosen up and relax certain muscles in the pelvic floor area. Unfortunately, it doesn't really seem to be working much. I talked with her about how frequent pushing out of urine, which mainly happens during bowel movements (I can just continuously push out small amounts of urine), really irritates my urethra and makes it feel as if I need to keep going. So part of the therapy also involved me trying to let any urine come out naturally without ever using the muscles to push out unless necessary. Doing this allowed for me to lengthen some of the time between urination and it also allowed for me to not need to ejaculate any urine during masturbation (up until about 15 min or a little before which still isnt 100% optimal). The current therapy is to try and hold my urine in and just increase the times between urinating in order to get my body and mind used to not peeing as often while is somewhat difficult after years of just going as much as I felt I needed to. I truly feel as if something is internally damaged although I'm not at all positive. I'm just really confused. I dont want to live life with any type of major procedure that wouldnt allow me to properly ejaculate semen anymore. I didn't think the urology field would be littered with so much uncertainty as well so that adds to the paranoia of nobody ever being able to tell me what's wrong or pinpoint something. If anybody has any advice or knowledge that I could pass onto my therapist or urologist, it would be life saving at this point.","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/92419/begging-for-any-advice-or-help-frequent-urination-penile-retraction-rare-sharp-urethra-sensation-when-urinating-rare-hard-to-describe-pains"},{"post":{"author":"miaman","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Herpes","post_content":"Does herpes cause continual burning, painful tingling in feet and legs, has been going on for 8 months now, very painful, also twitching in legs .

In fact, stress is one of those issues that not only can affect your sex life but also be alleviated by having sex. So if you want to get rid of stress and improve sexual performance, why don’t you just go have sex?\n\nThe effects of stress are gradual. It damages on your physical, emotional and relationship health, probably more than you realize.\nHere are five reasons stress impacts your sex life:\n1. Stress contributes to lowering our Self-Image.\n\nIf we don’t like our bodies, it is pretty difficult to find the desire to shed your clothes and be into bed with your partner. Not suggesting that you should just get it over with and improve sexual performance, but it’s a vicious cycle. Lower self-image equals less sex and less sex always creates relationship problems. Our relationship should enhance who we are and not make us feel more stressed.\n\n2. Stress takes a toll on our Sexual Desire.\nHormones affect our bodies in numerous ways from childhood to adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause and beyond. Cortisol is one of the hormones produced by stress. Our bodies need this hormone, but in small doses for short bursts of time. If levels of Cortisol are elevated for a prolonged period of time, they suppress our sex hormones. Lower quantity of sex hormones equals lower sexual desire. There are ways to improve sexual performance for me.\n3. Stress impacts our menstrual cycle and our fertility.\nStress can impact our pituitary gland, which controls the thyroid, adrenal glands, and ovaries. If ovaries aren’t functioning properly, your menstrual cycle is affected adversely. Periods may become irregular or we may even stop menstruating. If you are trying to get pregnant, you need to decrease your stress; which can be difficult, because there are few things more stressful than trying to become pregnant and not being able to do so.\n4. Stress makes us question our relationships and partners.\nWe all have stressful experiences from time to time because stress can come from so many things; Finances, Family pressures, Work, and Relationships. It can make us argumentative and prone to lashing out - ready to lose our temper at everything and anything. Or it may cause us to do both of these things - swing between different moods at different times. Relationships suffer when we are stressed, especially if we stop communicating; or if our communication only consists of rolling our eyes and grunting or shouting at a loved one.\n5. Stress can lead to excessive drinking.\nIt’s not a surprise that lots of people use alcohol to break-out of any situation. This isn’t about a single glass of wine, a bottle of beer or a drink with one of that cocktail with hot pink umbrellas in them. This is about excessive, prolonged and regular drinking.\nMen may face difficulty getting an erection when they drink too much. But, what about women? As it turns out, alcohol can dull your sex life, making it less pleasurable. Alcohol dehydrates us, making lubrication challenging. Without lubrication, sex is painful.\nSo it’s time, to transform your life.\nStart an exercise, relax, take a bath, drink one glass of wine (not four), masturbate, make out with your partner and delegate some responsibilities to others. It will improve sexual performance and lower your stress and hopefully, make it a lot more enjoyable.","like_count":"1","tags":["Women's Issues","Men's Issues"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/91786/how-stress-can-affect-your-sex-life"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"10 months ago","post_title":"I’m really worried I have genital warts and I’m pregnant","post_content":"Please help me.

If this event occurred it would have been roughly between the ages of 2 to 5 years of age. During that time I was subjected to two operations, supposedly to correct a birth defect (grossly malformed eye lid, huge amount of excess skin in the lid). Evidence that I later accidentally found casts doubt on the complete accuracy of this reason for the operations. There was clearly an unmistakable congenital deformity in my left eye lid that I personally observed in a photograph that I later accidentally found during my twenties. This photo of me was taken when I was an infant and prior to the eye operations, and it was the only photograph of me as an infant that I have ever seen. Whatever other pictures that may have existed have been hidden from me or destroyed. This birth defect was so egregious that nobody, lay person or experienced healthcare professional, could have possibly missed it or mistaken which eye was affected. However, the 'story' that I was given by my parents throughout my life was that the surgeon operating on the malformed eye 'accidentally' operated on the wrong eye during the first operation. The second operation was supposedly necessary to correct the original defect and reverse the earlier mistaken surgery on the normal eye. This story simply doesn't hold water, based upon what I saw in that photograph of me. I wonder what else was done to me then, while I was 'under the knife' that second time. My family lived in southwestern Virginia during that time and Virginia has a well-known history of eugenic sterilizations for numerous dubious reasons. There was ample history in both sides of my family to make me suspect that some agency may have coerced my parents to allow my sterilization during one of these operations as an alternative to permanent institutionalization. Given that the fallacies of eugenics were beginning to be increasingly questioned following WW II, I very much doubt that any records were made of this sterilization event if it happened, or if those records would have survived until now if they were made.\n\nWould a sperm count test at my age reveal unambiguous evidence of whether or not that I was sterilized? If not, is there any other test or examination that might reveal whether or not I was sterilized at an early age? At this stage of my life, I have zero interest in fathering children, but rather I am trying to fill in some missing pieces of my own history for peace of mind.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Male Fertility Question","resp_content":"Hi Yes just a simple sperm test would answer your question.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/86382/male-fertility-question"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Painful intercourse","post_content":"I’ve always had some issues with pain during sex but they’ve become unbearable and I haven’t actually had sex in well over a year.

When I looked at it the next day it was noticeable by sight and looked red to white colour. The next day when going to the toilet and pulled back my foreskin that there was a white kind of gunk behind my foreskin which I assumed was coming from the mark. This was pretty mini mull and caused no pain.\n\nThe next day when peeing I noticed that it was very painful when peeing as I assume the urine was going onto the mark. It now looked like it may have split and was more a yellow colour. This was when I decided to see the doctor that morning.\n\nThe doctor said it was probably Herpes as and told me to go to the GUM clinic for a test which I did. I had a culture test which was painful to take as well as a full std testing by urine sample. All these results including the culture came back negative. The pain when urinating went on for another day or two then stopped and the mark started to fade. 2 weeks later it is still visible to where the mark was but with no colour to it and it is not raised or causing any problems.\n\nI decided to send off for a blood test online which was a IgG test for antibodies against herpes. This has again comeback negative.\n\nI have never had this problem previously, I am recently married and been with my partner since 16 and are both now 33. We had one spell where we were not together about 8 years ago which was only a few months in which time I did have unprotected sex twice and she did not have any. Me and my wife have always had unprotected sex with each other and neither of us have had any symptoms of herpes before.\n\nWith all this being said can I now rule out herpes with all these negative tests?

Once you are diagnosed most can get treatment. I myself, have found that 20 yrs later, my outbreaks now, the worst for pain, it's ever been. Anus sores, are the most recurring, for me.\nBut be careful, you can transfer the sores to your bottom/rectum, leaving you with much more painful sores. As your anus has muscles that keep it tightly closed. But stretch when you pass gas, or have a bowel movement, painfully. Spreading from your vagina, when sores spread to the anus, this is the most painful spot, as the skin tightens, it pulls on the sores, even making them more active. Trust me!!..This spot, is the worst for pain.\nAcyclovir helps., but I haven't had a prescription for it in over 20+ yrs.

Same 2 ulcers on right side that have been there since the start.\nDec 24-28- my feet were too sore to stand for one entire day, legs ached, butt cheeks were numb, lymph nodes were swollen in groin and kind of protruding in a band formation. It hurt to sit, stand, lay. Everything was swollen\n*Dec 28 GYN swabs about 3 ulcers the 3 blisters seemed to be gone and done. diagnoses YI and HSV2 starts 1G Valtrex 2x day for 10days and antifungal vaginal suppositories. This helps my YI. Also gives me a lidocaine ointment for itching and pain.\n*Jan 2 regular GYN says ulcers are healed, blood tests and swabs inside for other STDs. Itching is intense keeps me up at night. She suggested lidocaine ointment and Benadryl at night.\n*Jan 7 I start Valtrex 500mg 1x/day suppression therapy on my request.\n*Jan 7 I take a diflucan that I had extra. Itching slows and almost stops. Still numb. White buildup on clitoris and under clitoris hood that i cleaned daily. Bladder retention. Constipation, finally ate prunes and have had one proper very soft poop otherwise it was 1-2 nickel sized hard bits every couple days. I don’t remember the last time i had a full size bowel movement. I stopped using lidocaine. Started using cortisone 10 with cooling.

No smell. It looks like a white mucous plug to vagina.\n- No new lesions\n- Not using any topicals\n- 500mg Valtrex\n- Also started reservatrol and LLysine supplements\n\n1 Should I get a blood test to help determine if this is new or old? Seems very much like a primary outbreak. Will Valtrex impede accurate results? When and how many times should I test?\n\n2 I know it’s probably a guess, but do you suspect dec15 unprotected sex or dec17 protected sex could be the cause? Neither men have gotten tested yet to my knowledge. Have asked both of their status and both say they are negative but I don’t know that I believe it wasn’t just their gut reaction to respond this way\n\n3 can you explain how Valtrex impedes testing? It sounds like it will decrease count for swab, but does it have an effect on antibody blood testing? Will supplements impede accurate testing? Will Valtrex block you from building antibodies?

Symptoms showing?","post_content":"My last unprotected sexual partner was almost 10 months ago. After i had sex, I feared having an STD/STI because my penis just felt abnormally warm. I waited a few weeks and got tested for gono and chlamydia. Negative for both. After i was tested, my mind was at ease and that symptom went away. I was even tested again a few months later by a different doctor and chlamydia trachomitis+Gono came back clean again. Still had no symptoms but I wanted to make sure.\n\nFast forward to now, and I have since been in a monogamous relationship with my girlfriend which began about a month after that encounter. Me and her had unprotected sex about a month after my previous encounter. And we’ve had sex like rabbits for 9+ months now. Except recently, she experienced some terrible pain during sex. To the point where entry is not happening. She insists that it may be a result of friction and lubrication, which can always be better. We used a glycerin based lube and I foolishly placed a dab on her clitoris during cunnilingus and it burned when she peed.\n\nWe’ve went this long with zero symptoms or issues during sex. Now, I have been urinating frequently possibly due to anxiety about this. I’ll experience a light lower back discomfort which I would describe as internal. And I tend to have an “itch” around the head area maybe once or twice a day. Not persistent to the point of discomfort or emergency, but an annoyance every now and then.\n\nShe doesn’t have a frothy discharge. No foul odor. The only itching or pain vagina-wise is during sex and post-shaving around the pubic area. She’s complained of fatigue recently as well?\n\nI’ve called nurses and they insist that it isn’t a yeast infection because there’s no discharge. I went to the ER as well for dry skin on my shaft area and they said it does not look like yeast either.\n\nI’m having anxiety about this because I truly have been monogamous and me and her have been on a roll in our relationship. Meeting each other’s families, becoming healthier everything. I’m fearing that something pre-monogamy may be an STD and cause her to think I cheated and ruin everything.\n\nUTI? Yeast?

We've had unprotected sex twice, with only a short conversation (\"'are u clean?' 'Yes, I'm also on prep.'\") prior to having sex. About 6 months ago I discovered that I'd contracted type 2/genital herpes. I've learned a little about the virus, in that, it's most contagious and easiest to pass along during an outbreak, at which point in time, sexual contact should be avoided. I haven't had an outbreak in months, they r not frequent in my case. But I have read there is a small(?) chance the virus can be passed on, even during a \"non-outbreak\" period. I already feel really bad that I haven't discussed this with my partner, and wouldn't want them to think I knowingly put them in harms way, and didn't tell them. My question is, should I let the person know my situation and give them the option of whether or not they want to continue with me, with caution, and also risk losing them?

I know that this is probably an uncomfortable situation for you to be in, but there are ways to have a wonderful, sexually satisfying relationship, while still protecting your partner when you have genital herpes. I understand that you're afraid to lose your partner, but trust is a key ingredient in any relationship.\n\nIt's important that you find a way to tell your partner since they might have been exposed to the virus. But you're not alone! Here are some helpful resources to help you through the process:\n\nHere ( http://wb.md/2bMRVh9) is a really great resource to learn more about broaching the issue of genital herpes with your sexual partner. Here are two things you should keep in mind while reading the article: (1) Don't wait to tell your partner until you're just about to have sex because the heat of the moment might affect their judgement (2) Genital herpes doesn't detract from your many desirable qualities....You are just as great as you were before contracting the virus.\n\nThis ( http://wb.md/2bzlyxt) is another informative resource about how to tell your partner that you have genital herpes. According to the article, being informed about genital herpes, choosing your words wisely, picking the right setting and the right time to tell your partner are all important aspects to take into consideration.\n\nHere are two resources that you can read together:\n\n1) Frequently Asked Questions When Your Partner Has Genital Herpes -- http://wb.md/2c519Ce\n\n2) What to do when your partner has genital herpes? -- http://wb.md/2bwdO25\n\nAnd remember, honesty is always the best policy!!!\n\nI also encourage you that you and your partner sit down with a doctor. A doctor will be able to answer all of you and your partner's questions, which might be able to help ease tensions and uncertainties.\n\nBe sure to come back and update us!

But once you do, I'm sure that your partner will respect that you are telling them now so that they can seek the appropriate treatment (if they need it).\n\nSometimes when I'm nervous when being honest with someone, I write them a letter with all of my thoughts and read it to them. This allows me to get all of my thoughts, feelings and emotions out without forgetting anything, or avoiding big subjects that I might have not addressed had I not prepared myself.\n\nWe're here for you along the way.

These tests were negative for everything that was tested for, including HPV.\n\nSince 1 year before that test, 2013 I believe, my ex-husband has been in the Middle East and, to this day, hasn't come back.\n\nThis entire time period, 2013-Now, I have had no sexual contact or even kissed a man.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I had an HPV test, and it was positive. Thank god, it wasn't positive for the cancer causing strains, but all the same, I am extremely alarmed.\n\nI explained this to my doctor (PA), and she told me that that means that I have had HPV to whole time.\n\nCould this be true?\n\nWhat else could have caused a positive test result?\n\nIs a positive screening test a diagnosis?\n\nHow accurate are these tests?\n\nAll my life, for good or bad, I have been the 1 in a million.

If You’re Infected, Your Current Partner May Not Be to Blame\n\nIf you learn you have HPV (this is most likely to occur after an abnormal Pap test result; most doctors don’t routinely test for HPV otherwise), don’t jump to conclusions about where you contracted the virus.\n\n“Some patients assume that their current sexual partner gave it to them,” says Robinson. “But that’s probably not the case. The women who develop cervical cancer at age 40 probably got infected shortly after [having sex] with their first sexual partner.”\n\nThat’s because HPV can stay dormant for years before it starts causing the cell damage that can lead to cancer.

It is now August 2018 and I haven’t had an outbreak since the initial one. I remember having a fever, feeling weak.. tired and having the blisters around my anus area and some in my vagina. My doctor informed me that it was GHSV1 and I most likely got it from oral sex with a partner that I had. I was so upset at first. The stigma around having herpes is not fun.. the jokes your friends tell, the lines in those movies or tv shows.. they all make me so upset. No one knows but my mother and I. I just try to brush it off knowing there’s nothing I can do about it but be careful and take medicine if I feel one coming on. I do get tingly and itchy down there but it stops and I never get any actual blisters or outbreaks. I’m assuming maybe it’s just the way I shave since my skin is very sensitive and products make me itch very easily. I wasn’t bothered as much and I try to go on with my day when I think about having it. The only time it truly gets to me is when I think of having sex, when I’m in the middle of a sexual encounter or when I think of a future long term relationship and I eventually have to tell the person that I’m with. I can’t even really enjoy oral sex anymore... I know transmission is lower than HSV2 but I’m still paranoid and instead of enjoying sex with someone, my mind runs and runs about my HSV1. Since I never had an outbreak since the initial one and it’s very rare that I will ever get one or get many in my lifetime.. I’m not bothered by actually having it. I’m more bothered by the “idea of having herpes.” The social stigma and the jokes around it are worse than actually having it. I’m afraid to tell a future partner whom I already invested time and love in and they walk away because they think I “slept around too much” or I’m “dirty”. I’m afraid to tell people now who I sleep with. I’m a young girl so when I date, of course I’m careful but if I drink one night with someone I’m attracted to.. or have a connection with, or I hang out with a partner I’ve had sex with in the past.. sometimes things happen. It can happen with anyone. I just need some advice to make me feel better. I just turned 23 and although I know GHSV1 isn’t a big deal as some people make of it... I try not to get bothered by sex is what scares me. I’m usually safe and I have medicine that I plan to take when I do get another outbreak/cream that I have for the blisters but my doctor told me daily medicine isn’t necessary. I’ve also been trying to eat healthy as I normally do and I plan on getting lysine pills to help keep outbreaks at bay. Any more advice on the transmission rates or just help/facts/advice in general so I’m more aware? It’s been a while but it’s been on my mind lately. I don’t know why...

However, women who will not have any inkling about such growths can get overly worried about it and associate it to some kind of a sexually transmitted disease, thus demanding some kind of a treatment to get rid of them. Such women will initially need some form of support and reassurance to deal with their anxieties and stress. Total excision of the papules via surgery will provide complete cure.

I don't drink or take caffeine, i take my multi-vitamin everyday still, I have seen my doctor and i can confirm i do not have chlamydia or gonorrhea and tests came back negative for those, i have also gotten a prostate exam taken, no pain when the prostate was touched, also had an ultrasound of my testicles and nothing was found there either. I don't know if im just experiencing a really really bad UTI or if this is something worse. I should also mention this is my 2nd UTI within 18 months. When i do masturbate or ejaculate i do not always pee directly after which is maybe why i do get them but i'm no doctor and that's why i'm here.

Keep in mind that the Oraquick test is not a 4th Generation screening test; it tests only for antibodies, not the p24 antigen which is present during the first month after transmission in a newly infected individual.\n\nAn antibody only test might not be accurate if someone tests just days after a potential exposure. At that point in time the immune system may not even be aware that a foreign substance (the virus) has invaded the body and thus has not yet even begun to crank out antibodies to this.\n\nAt any rate, this does not involve you. You tested at least 4-5 months after your \"potential\" exposure. If you were positive at that point in time, you certainly would be producing enough antibodies that these tests would have come back as \"reactive\" (positive) without question. Because there results came back as negative this clearly shows your negative status.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nGail\n1\nReply\nmiaman\nover 1 year ago\nThanks for the info. I feel better now.

Possibly a bug bite? I really just don’t know.\n\nI have been married to the same woman for almost 10 years and with her for almost 12. I have never cheated. Is it possible that an STI such as Syphilis has been dormant in my system since before we were together and just now showing up or am I worrying for no reason? I know she has not cheated so that’s not an issue either. We have children togehter and have had unprotected sex for years and they run all types of tests during pregnancy and she was negative in everything.\n\nI only had sex with one other girl before my wife and it was a one night stand but a condom was used. I have done other things with other women but no intercourse.\n\nAny thoughts? Is it possible to be 12+ years out and an STI show the first symptoms like a sore or chancre? The sore was the only symptom. No swollen lymph nodes, burning with urination, etc.\n\nI tend to be a nervous person anyway, should this be something I should be worried about or am I making a big deal out of nothing?\n\nThanks.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: STI 12+ years after initial infection?","resp_content":"HI Well Nip into your local sexual health/GUM clinic and get tested, its the only way your ever find out what it is, doing this it will stop you stressing, there are some STD's that love to hide in deep tissue and pop out when the feel like it.\n\nIts the only way your stop your worrying.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/56765/sti-12-years-after-initial-infection"},{"post":{"author":"fxguy","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Herpes type 1 positive test?","post_content":"Im so confused about a positive Herpes type 1 test.

I have a tear at the bottom of my vagina not relating to childbirth that happened from sexual intercourse before I got pregnant that I did not go to the doctor for and has healed looking like a skin tag and when the health department nurse did my exam she said that all just looks like normal trauma from childbirth and didn’t do a Pap smear because I’m not 21 but did do all other std testing which I am waiting on the results for. HIV negative and bacterial infections negative. I will try to post pictures if it lets me if not I can send them to someone that thinks they might have an idea of what’s going on. My mom has had 6 kids one of which was 10 pounds born at home and looks nothing like this. My baby was 6 pounds and I had a very easy delivery with only 5 minutes of pushing and a very minor tear that was stitched up. I also have had std testing done a couple months after having my daughter and everything always came back clean and I’ve only had 4 sexual partners since having her in September and only 2 this year and havnt had any sex in almost 7 months. Which causes me to doubt stds also. Idk what to think so if anyone has any idea what this could be please comment and let me know what you think.","like_count":"0","tags":["Women's Issues","HPV/Genital Warts"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Possible Hpv but pelvic exam ruled normal.. cherry sized growths in vagina opening","resp_content":"Hi Just how often before this have you looked at your vagina, because what your explaining sounds very much like your labia minor, that may have got bigger through child birth.\n\nHave a look through this link its lots of vaginas and as you see some have very big labia lips, is this what your seeing?\n\nhttp://beautifullabia.tumblr.com/\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/55600/possible-hpv-but-pelvic-exam-ruled-normal-cherry-sized-growths-in-vagina-opening"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Chlamydia","post_content":"I've been with my girlfriend off and on for nearly a year now and recently had a doctor's appointment where they wanted to screen me for an std as I had one back in 2016.

Last Nov 25, I had sore and lesions around my big nipples. Both of my nipples. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS IN MY LIFE. A day before that, I made love to my husband. That was the last sex I had with him before this condition happened. We almost do this at least 3 times a week. He loved sucking my big nipples using his teeth and I had a feeling that's the reason why it got aggravated. Again, we have been doing this. On the 26th, I felt the pain more - like a stabbing pain. I suspected it got worse coz of my tight-fitting shirt and my bra. I decided to wear loose shirt and then apply bacitracin. Moreover, to soothe the pain, I cleaned it using water with apple cider vinegar and then apply some coconut oil because I suspected it to be a fungal/yeast infection caused by candida, or a nipple thrush, even if I'm not lactating (based on my research, possible to have it even for non-lactating women).\n\nThen on the 27th, I felt better with the help of that coconut oil but the pain is still there and it's manageable. And then I noticed white bumps. One white bump on my left areola then 2 on my right areola. Pls note, this does not look like tiny blister in cluster forms. They looked like some sort of a hair follicle infection – well at least to me. You know, those dots around the areola? I believe that's an areolar gland. So, that's where the bumps are. Then on my left breast, it has some redness. I got panicked coz I began to think it could be breast inflammatory cancer or what so we decided to go the hospital on the 28th.\n\nAt the emergency, the doctor asked me for any symptoms. I don't feel any weirdness going on my body, like fatigue, loss of appetite or fever. I felt normal except this pain I have with my nipples and areola. The doctor could not say what this could be so she suggested me to have swab test on these bumps by breaking them. (Man, it hurt! I thought I have to undergo mammogram/MRI screening, etc. But nope!)\nOne for herpes through viral culture test and the other one is for bacterial infection. Then, she gave me a prescription for a 4-mix cream, which includes anti-bacterial cream, desitin, chlotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I applied this twice a day and I could see the progress.\n\nA day after that, the ER doctor referred me to an infectious disease specialist while waiting for the results. Basically, she is also unaware about my condition and can't rule out yet. But she said it COULD NOT BE HERPES. So, I was glad to hear that. She prescribed me an oral antibacterial pills for 5 days. Again, I saw some progress. My nips and areola began to heal.\n\nThen today, I felt like they are doing pretty well now but I still continued applying that 4-mix cream. My happiness subsided when I received a phone call from that specialist and told me that I have a positive result for HERPES TYPE1 and positive result on bacterial infection. Like WHAT?!!! I was so emotional and depressed. I have a prescription called acyclovir but I did not take it.\nDue to that, I wasn't able to ask these questions to my doctor. Appreciate if you could enlighten me this. And sorry for a long post.\n\n1. Is it possible really to have herpes type 1 on your nipples and areola? Before this condition happened, I had an IgG blood test and it was negative for both types 1 and 2 last Jan 2016. I took this test coz my GYN told me to do so as I had some sort of a cut in my genital area. My husband also had a negative result. AND NOW, a positive result through viral culture test. HOW COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE? I only have a monogamous relationship. But my hubby got 2 other relationships before me. He did not notice any abnormalities like cold sores happened on his body throughout his life.\n2. Herpes type 1 is not an STD-type of thing?\n3. This is still unacceptable for me. For how long should I wait til I have that next IgG blood test again? I wanna ensure if these lab test results are accurate.\n4. Speaking of accuracy, is the viral culture test reliable? Can it be a false positive?\n5. Are there any other reliable tests to prove if one (who is not experiencing any symptoms) is positive or negative herpes aside from this viral culture test and blood test? I'm talking about after the outbreak. Like if you don't feel any symptoms, yet you want to know if there are herpes anti-bodies present.\n6. How can you tell if it's herpes? Like I said, I felt tingling and painful sensation, a bit of redness only on my one breast, lesions around my nipples and some white bumps. But these white bumps are not in cluster form though…. With the help of the cream, it somehow worked. Now, they looked ok and normal to me. Do you think it really is herpes based on my description?\n7. Lastly, we do kiss a lot too and even do oral sex. But no cold sores or whatsoever for both of us. Do you think this positive result viral culture test could be WRONG?\n8. That Acyclovir, what is it for? And when will you apply it?

Needless to say I have found a new dr since. I was completely shocked because I did not suspect anything and was just going for my yearly screening in an attempt to be sexually responsible. Upon further review of my test results, I saw that My igm was positive for hsv2 (1:80) and my igg was negative for both hsv 1 and 2 (0.09) I spoke to a friend who is an obgyn in another state and she told me this was a useless test and in the absence of an outbreak, it meant nothing. I did not think I had ever had an outbreak, but once I thought about it, I remembered having what I thought was a yeast infection about 2 days after a one night stand with a questionable guy. I had the usual itching and burning and one bump-like area. It was basically swollen and red with a tiny Whitehead in the center, no bigger than a pin head. To me it looked like an inflamed hair follicle. I have had similar bumps with a yeast infection before and so I figured that’s what it was. It didn’t hurt at all. I treated for a yeast infection and the bump and symptoms went away in about 3 days. I spoke to my dr about this and she said it didn’t sound like an outbreak. We had sex one time and used a condom. This was the only new partner I had had since my last full panel the previous year, which was negative for everything. Also, I had been with this guy only about a month before the blood test, so I guess it’s not likely that it would have shown up yet. However, I worry that this is why only the igm was positive, and this raised my concern. I went ahead and told my boyfriend all of this, and he decided he loved me and didn’t care if I had it or not :-) He decided he wanted to continue to have unprotected sex. I continud with no symptoms we recognized as herpes, but I did have some occasional burning and one time was felt like diaper rash on my butt. It was a hot humid summer in New York, so this didn’t seem too strange. Any time I felt something weird, my boyfriend would get down there with a flashlight and check it out. He always decided things looked fine and he still wanted to have sex. After a few months my boyfriend got a blood test for hsv2 which was negative. We figured this meant I was probably negative since we had been having lots of unprotected sex, even when I had what felt like similar yeast infections. (I have always been very prone to them.) However, I have now been having burning in my vaginal area off and on for several months. There is no odor or discharge associated with this burning, and it is generalized over my entire vagina. The burning is worse after I pee, not on my urethra, but on my labia. Twice I went to my dr for this, the first time I was diagnosed with a uti, which I thought was strange since I get them all the time and this didn’t feel like one. The second time (new dr) she said everything looked totally normal. Most recently, I started to feel the burning again and I got out the mirror and flashlight. I found two tiny little white bumps that looked like the regular kinda “chicken skin” bumps that we have all over our genital skin, just slightly raised. Again, the size of a pinhead. No redness this time. This was on a Saturday, and I told myself I would go to the dr Monday, finally get a swab, and have some diffinitive answers. Although I wasn’t sure there was really anything to break open and swab. But by Monday the tiny bumps were gone, although the burning persisted. Tuesday I got my period. The burning is very mild now, but worse after I pee, and it hurts a little to put tampons in and take them out, mostly at the opening of my vagina. The pain and burning is not localized to any “spots” but generalized over my entire vagina. I had this kind of pain inserting my tampons during my period once a couple months ago as well. It feels similar to when my vagina is very dry. Could I be suffering from vaginal dryness? Or could this general burning and sensitivity be herpes outbreaks? Could these tiny bumps that I have noticed that lasted 2 days be herpes? I have considered getting the blood test again, but my dr says it won’t really tell us anything. It would be great to know my status definitively, but my real concern is knowing if/when I’m having an outbreak so that I don’t pass it to my partner. Also, if these are simply mild outbreaks, I can stop going to the dr and getting tested for a million things every time i have this burning. I have not experienced any tingling, numbness or itching, or noticed anything that I perceived as a “blister” or “lesion.” I’m not sure if I am being over or under cautious. I am a 34 y/o female with a history of utis and yeast infections.","like_count":"0","tags":["Genital Herpes"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Am I Having Herpes Outbreaks?","resp_content":"Hi First ever heard of paragraphs, its makes it hard reading.\n\nOK I think you need to have a trip to your local sexual health/GUM clinic, and get some tests done there, reason STI's and STD's is there field of work, so its really the best place to be, and get some good advice.\n\nIf your a shaved lady, if not get shaved YI's love a warm damp area, what vaginal hairs have, then daily after washing use some coconut oil around your vaginal area.\n\nUTI's are an odd one to keep getting, could be of your pubic hairs holding a virus, could be the way you wipe if you go back to front, could be what you eat if you like sweet things, consuming more garlic could help.\n\nBut please try the clinic.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/54316/am-i-having-herpes-outbreaks"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"I’m afraid that I have Genital Warts","post_content":"I dont know if these lumps/bumps are normal growths of if they are in fact Genital Warts","like_count":"0","tags":["HPV/Genital Warts"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: I’m afraid that I have Genital Warts","resp_content":"Hi sorry I see nothing was there supposed to be a picture here?\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/54281/i-m-afraid-that-i-have-genital-warts"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"ARE THESE WARTS??","post_content":"I have no clue as to whether these bumps inside my vagina could be warts or not","like_count":"0","tags":["HPV/Genital Warts","Genital Herpes"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: ARE THESE WARTS??","resp_content":"Hi The way you have written this was the meant to be a picture, but at a guess it could be Vaginal Pearly Papules, google that and look at the images and compare to what you have.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/54233/are-these-warts"},{"post":{"author":"2chainzfanclub","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Sex after Chlamydia","post_content":"Me and my partner had chlmadyia, we both were treated but he did not wait a full week after FINISHING his antibiotics to have sex.

Sometimes hydroceles go away on their own. If not, there are various possible treatments. The simplest is removal of the fluid through a needle, but the hydrocele is likely to recur over the following few months. To cure the problem once and for all, a surgical operation is necessary.\n\nI suggest you go see a urologist and talk to him about your problems with your testicles, if its just this swelling that is troubling you about the size there getting to, find out what needs to be done, and at the same time you could talk about having a castration done, and a good time to talk it through.\n\nNOWHARD\nReply\ndavidbarry\nover 1 year ago\nok i will see about getting castrated they are really uncomfortable hanging between my legs when i sit on them ?..\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/52981/huge-test"},{"post":{"author":"cmw1979","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"What is a normal sex drive for a 39 year old guy?","post_content":"One of my buddies was telling me how he hadn't gotten off in over a month and was getting frustrated.

Its long history of use as a food suggests it probably is generally safe to consume. However, its safety for children or pregnant women has not been thoroughly investigated, according to the NYU Langone Medical Center.\nEstrogenic Activity\nThe Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center reports maca root possesses estrogenic activity. While it is unclear if this would translate to any real danger, using supplements with estrogenic activity could prove problematic in certain instances, such as suffering from or having an increased risk of breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive diseases. If this applies to you, discuss the potential risks of using maca root in this instance.\nImpaired Thyroid Function\nMaca contains substances called glucosinolates, which can interfere with production of thyroid hormone -- particularly in the presence of a low-iodine diet – and cause goiter, a swelling of the gland that results in a lump at the base of neck. The University of Michigan Health System reports that while other foods that contain these substances have been shown to impair thyroid function, it has not been proven that maca causes this problem as well, though it is likely it would produce a similar effect. Reduced thyroid function most commonly strikes women over 50, so if you fall into this category and do not know the status of your thyroid function, consider getting tested before using maca.\nOther Safety Concerns\nMaca has been touted as a treatment for both male and female infertility, although the NYU Longone Medical Center cautions that it's not yet clear how well it works. If you have an interest in using maca to improve your chances of conception, discuss this with your doctor. This is especially important if you are taking standard fertility drugs, as you want to make sure your doctor does not have concerns about negative interactions that could affect their efficacy. Do not use while pregnant or breastfeeding due to lack of safety data. If you have liver or kidney disease, always clear the use of supplements with your doctor.\n\nAbout Tribulus read this link.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045980/\n\nSo Swedish follower pollen, seems Relizen is base on SPF as your read below, and as your read has no side effects.\n\nR.

Long story short, met a girl, second date she had a cold sore in the final/healing stage. It wasn't weeping/wet, had a scab on it, pinkish/redish skin, looked like a cut. Had a great time, some alcohol, we end up kissing a lot. Scab fell of easily.\nMy question is this. At the healing stage, the spot not wet, how likely is transmission of hsv-1 to me? If after I washed the areas she contacted would that have done anything? Also question if immune system factors in to transmission, as I have been taking immune system boosting supplements. Know getting hsv-1 isn't the end of the world and most of the population has it, just if I had a chance to avoid it I'd like to. Know we shouldn't of kissed with a mark present but it didn't look bad and she's really an awesome girl so wasn't really thinking I guess. If I don't see anything by 20 days after exposure, should I just stop worrying about it? It's been almost 3 days and nothing so far.\n\nAlso, don't know if this is a factor, probably not but trying to be concise with info, but it was on the corner of her mouth at the lower lip, so don't know how much I would have contacted that spot. I'm no expert, it looked like it was healing, but what if it wasn't at that stage? I saw a small scab at the top and a rough line of intended red skin below, like a shallow cut I guess, assumed the scab meant healing stage. What if it was an earlier stage? Do I have a higher chance?\n\nAnd finally, what if it was HSV-2?

I am 20 years old, and had periods since I was a teenager. For the past two years, I have always had regular periods (28days), and most periods started on the expected date, while some were early or late only be one or two days.\n\nMy (usual) PMS symptoms are: cramping, mood swings, and discharging of large amounts of fluid from the vagina.\nAlso, usually during mensuration, I have cramping and mood swings.\n\nHowever, since February, these things started to change:\n\nOn February, my period was supposed to start on February 27th, but started on the 24th. Not only was the period 3 days early (which has almost never happened to me before), but I also did not have any PMS symptoms before menstruation (but still had extreme cramping during the menstruation).\n\nThen, the next period, which should've started on March 24th, started on April 5th, almost 2 weeks late. This time, I experienced very little PMS symptoms, and during menstruation, had the same amount of extreme cramping.\n\nLastly, my period is supposed to start on May 3rd, but it still isn't starting(meaning that my period is three days late), and I feel no cramping whatsoever. (no signs of PMS) However, I urinate more frequently, and the bottom part of my vagina hurts (it has a stinging sensation). Also, when I urinate or hold my urine, that stinging pain becomes more painful. Additionally, the left side of my pelvis feels like it’s being pressured (that pain increases when I lie down).\n\nAlso, regarding the fluid that is discharged from my vagina (which I have mentioned above) Usually, that fluid is mostly transparent and white, odorless, and is discharged in large amounts during menstruation. However, during the last couple of weeks, it has become yellow, form small chunks (like smashed tofu), and smells like fish. Also, instead of discharging lots of that fluid during menstruation, they were discharged in large amounts since two weeks ago (two weeks ‘before’ the expected period). They were discharged in very large amounts). Then once the expected period date arrived, they are almost not being discharged at all(but it still smells like fish).\n\nThe length of mensturation remains the same (5 days)\n\n\nWhen I was in 9th grade, because my cramping during and menstruation was so severe, I had an ultrasound test to check if the excessive amount of pain was due to any secondary causes (such as diseases). However, the ultrasound confirmed that I had no such diseases. (Although this test was done a few years ago, I am still bringing this up just in case it may help)\n\nWhat could be causing these irregularities in the timing of my period and the change in the fluid in the vagina? I mean, for two whole years, my period and everything stayed relatively constant, then all of a sudden, the PMS symptoms are different, the days are not periodic, and the vaginal discharge has changed.\n\n**Also, I had my first sex a weeks ago. Could this be the cause?\n\n\nPlease don't be afraid to make guesses or ask questions, as I'm guessing that the information that I have posted enough may not be sufficient enough for a full examination.\n\nThank you in advance for your response.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Erratic period and weird vaginal discharge.","resp_content":"You have an infection, evidenced by the fish smell.

I´m writing beneath what I found out after some research. Please correct me if i´m wrong!\n\n1. The “v” stands for virus, warts are just an infection of the top layer of the skin caused by the virus. Hence if your immune system supresses the virus you´ll never have warts but you could still have the virus and could spread it.\n2. You don´t test for the virus under the age of 25 because everybody, who is sexually active, has it anyways.\n3. Taking those two points into account, statistically speaking the chance of contracting HPV from someone who has warts vs someone who doesn’t have visible warts is basically the same.\n4.

I don’t know if this is normal or I have a health problem. I’m asking here because I’ve looked it up and I’m not getting many helpful answers :( so maybe it would be better to describe my specific case:\n\nI would like to try having sex with my boyfriend. I have been masturbating for several years and can give myself an orgasm easily by stimulating the clitoris (it feels really nice and healthy for me and I would like to try and go the “whole way” as a change to see what that also feels like). However, we have never had actual penetrative sexual intercourse even though we have been trying for about 7 months - this is because it is so extremely painful for me whenever he attempts to enter me. I get a very painful sharp, stabbing kind of pain along with a burning feeling. It gets so bad that I have ended up screaming or crying a few times from how painful it is. It feels like I’m being torn in half. Some of these times I have urged him through tears to keep trying and push it in despite the pain but it just won’t go in. It feels sometimes like my body is rejecting having something inside it. The furthest he has ever got inside me was the tip of his penis.\n\nI went to a doctor about it and:\nI was asked, is there enough foreplay? Am I naturally lubricated enough? I think I am, and I have used artificial lubricant as well because it helps. I feel very ready and ‘in the mood’ before we try it, it’s just when it actually happens that the pain comes in. I don’t get the same “sandpaper” feeling some women get either.\nI know I don’t have a sexually transmitted infection because my boyfriend has never had a sexual partner in any way before me and vice versa.\nThe doctor told me that if I can insert a tampon, I do not have a serious health issue like vaginismus. I had never used tampons before, but I tried it, and it went in fine, a bit of discomfort but no pain.\n\nAfter this I tried using a toy since it is a bit bigger than a tampon (but still quite a bit smaller than the real thing). It went in fine, the same as the tampon, with a bit of discomfort but still no pain.\n\nAlthough this is all fine, whenever I try with my boyfriend it is always the same - unbearably painful, and every time has started to feel like an ordeal even though I am the one asking him to try it. I feel really disheartened about the whole thing. I feel like I will never be able to have sex or enjoy it. I feel like I should just tell my boyfriend that I want to give up trying and just go without - but the idea of it is really disappointing, he and I wanted to experience this very normal and healthy part of adult life together.\n\nThank you for reading, if anyone has any idea about what could be wrong it is much appreciated!

The issue started after I had the most horrendous UTI in late January. The first antibiotics I was given did not work for my infection and the UTI started to become a kidney infection as well, so I went back to the doctor and got new antibiotics and everything started to clear up right away.\n\nHowever, ever since then I've been experiencing just some general vaginal discomfort. It ISN'T itchy, and I wouldn't necessarily classify it as a burning sensation either, it's just uncomfortable. It seems to be most prevalent first thing in the morning and then again in the evenings, with some normalization during mid-day. Other than this I don't seem to have any other vaginitis symptoms. I have used at home tests to test my ph, both urine and the actual vagina, and both are in normal range. Is it possible to have some sort of infection when your ph is in normal range?\n\nOne other thing to note is that I don't tend to have symptoms when I have a yeast infection. The one time I was told I had a yeast infection by a doctor was when I went for a completely unrelated reason and they drew some blood and told me I had a yeast infection as well, even though I had ZERO symptoms.\n\nI've been scouring the internet like crazy, researching BV/Yeast infections/UTIs, hoping to find an answer as to what is wrong with me but can't find anything that is similar to my case. Really the only symptom is vaginal discomfort. It's made me weary about having sex with my husband and has been a real damper on our physical relationship. I'm stressed and he is worried about making anything worse.\n\nI'm really hoping for some insight from the internet, and I know everyone is going to say \"Go to your doctor,\" but I can't because I don't have any insurance. Going to the clinic twice before for that UTI already hurt my wallet and I'm afraid if I go again and they check my ph that shows no sign of infection they're going to say nothing is wrong or at least nothing that they can see, and then I'll have to say goodbye to another $100. As soon as I have insurance I will be finding an OBGYN, but at this point it's not possible.\n\nBut is just simple vaginal discomfort a sign of anything when you have no other symptoms and it's been going on for a couple months?

It is not linked to my wife, she finds having intercourse enjoyable, I do not. So the problem is not applied to her.\n\nMy wife like so many has occasionally performed Fellatio. I have heard so many guys, reading from forums that is, how much enjoyment they have from this. I do not. Mainly because I can't keep an erection when she does this. Weird, right? Nor can I ejaculate when this occurs. What is the correct response? All I do is stare at her like she is doing something wrong. I've tried several times to shut my eyes, you know like they do in \"dirty movies\", but still I can't find any enjoyment of this.\n\nI have told her how this has occurred prior to getting married. Same problem. It's like some kind of sexual block. And no I had never been sexually abused. There are a lot of sexual activities I do not enjoy, for example, when she performs an oral sex act by (allowing) me to insert my testicles into her mouth. It is painful. Also, whenever I obtain an erection, my penis will swell and begin to pulsate very tensely. When this happens, it's indescribably painful. Do you suggest that sexual blockage would cause this kind of issue?","like_count":"1","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Sex Q & A","resp_content":"Hi Yes you are in need of help, but I'm not sure in which way to go for you, when I was young could not wait to get my hands on a naked body and still love the feeling of my wife either having oral sex or vaginal sex and now at the age of 70 I'm gaining girth and length on my penis with a Bathmate so my wife gets more pleasure from me.\n\nPerhaps your not feeling sexual pleasure, it could be your libido that's down, try getting a blood test done for your hormones, perhaps this has always been your problem and take it from there, if you have low Testosterone you doctor can put this right for you.\n\nIt may pay you to pop over to www.dodsonandross.com join and put this letter to Dr Betty Dodson and see what she says is behind your problem, but do have a very good read around her site your find it very interesting, your see on the left hand side lots of topics these are done mostly in the way of blogs and letters to Betty and her very straight answers.\n\nSee if you can find a copy of Love Play by Dr David Delvin this will take you step be step through foreplay taking in all your wife's parts for sexual pleasure and your parts, its a great bedside book for both of you, try ABE books.com your find it cheap on there.\n\nYou say when you get erections its painful, is this because you foreskin is not fully retracting, that is quite a common thing to happen, if that is your case you need to get your foreskin stretched, which is a quote east thing to do, takes just a few weeks to do.\n\nWith the aid of some baby oil massage some on your foreskin and with your thumb and first finger and take a pinch each side and pull your foreskin away from your body and at the same time pulling sideways hold and release and do the for 5 minutes 3 or 4 times a day, so your fore completely retracts with luck that should stop your pain.\n\nAny thing else just please do come back.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"timben","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Nowhard: I do not have foreskin.","resp_content":"Reply\nnohard\nover 2 years ago\nOK So perhaps you have been cut to tight, as your see above I use a Bathmate and one thing I have noticed is as I'm gaining some good girth and some length I'm also gaining foreskin, I wonder then if a Bathmate would be of help you, its something I was going to ask on pegym. its a site for guys wanting answer to penal questions and guys like me who want to gain, have ED problems, premature ejaculations and some general fun.\n\nSee my thinking is this if I gain so should you, when using one you go in it slack and the pumping draws blood down your penis and outwards as well, so you can see by these actions how your gain some extra skin, so by doing that you take away the pain your getting.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Sex Q & A","resp_content":"Sorry one last bit there is a foreskin restoration forum on there, so that may be of help.\n\nJust thinking.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"timben","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"No thank you.

HIV? Neither?","post_content":"Hi everyone. I am looking for feedback on whether I should be concerned. So here goes: I am male and have been in a heterosexual monogamous relationship for several years. We are both completely healthy with no std history. In the last 6 months I have gone outside the relationship and have had isolated encounters with two women with unknown history, one in August 2017, the other, early January 2018. These were both protected vaginal intercourse encounters (condoms used). Early last month, I discovered a small, firm bump on my scrotum skin (like a small pea) which caused no pain but was slightly itchy (I do shave/manscape that area regularly). I became concerned and checked the web for some answers. I read that Apple cider vinegar applied to the area may turn colour on the case of HPV so I did so by dipping a Qtip in the vinegar then held on the area for a few minutes. The bump turned whitish, became inflamed then turned a dark red, probably burned due to the vinegar. A day later it grew to become a whitehead and I popped it in the shower (clearish coloured puss then blood). I became concerned over this and went to a clinic the next day for anonymous STI testing. They took a herpes swab of the sore (which was already scabbing) and did a full blood and urine test. The nurse told me she thought it looked like a cyst (but I've never had cysts before). As I was waiting for the results in early Feb I was also going through a bout of the flu (coughing, chills, muscle aches). I called two weeks ago and the results were negative - note 25 days had passed since the last sexual encounter and the test. They told me while results were negative they do NOT test for HPV/herpes in the blood - just the swab. A small comfort but I'm still concerned. I notice that since September 2017 (a month after the first encounter) that my tongue, throat cause random discomfort (tongue pain mainly - it feels like when you bite down on your tongue but milder - no sores or lumps). My family doc thinks that's indigestion/reflux. Also, when I stand up from sitting I feel a slight lightheadedness and notice my temples turn pinkish (no rash - just a flushness that quickly subsides). Very occasionally my genital area gets a bit itchy but other than that that's it. There have been no other sores, no rashes (although I have had some isolated bumps that get itchy on my forearm).

It's a \"natural method\" of penis enlargement as I was very insecure of my size at the time. You basically use lube to \"milk\" the blood forward in the penis and trap it there. I followed all precautions but never the less, after only 3 weeks of doing it, I found that almost all of my sexual sensitivity was gone. I've seen many doctors and done endless research as I can't let myself quit. I've tried accepting it but I simply can't have any sort of healthy sex life if I don't find something as there is barely any sensitivity on my penis to generate an erection.\n\nFYI when I say pleasurable sensitivity, I mean the sexually pleasing sensitivity. I don't have any numbness where I can't feel my penis.\n\nSymptoms:\n-Spider veins in shaft that only show while erect.\n-White spots on glans (only show when flaccid)\n- Almost no pleasurable sensitivity on top or sides of shaft. Almost none on bottom until you get within an inch of the glans where it's about 30% what it used to be.\n- Glans are also 25-30% what they used to be except on right side where they're about 20%. glan and upper belly sensitivity go down to like 10% for a couple days if I masturbate then work their way back up (never used to happen, everything used to stay at 100%, I'd just be less horny.)\n-I have feeling in penis at all times, it has never gone completely numb but certainly has lost most of the sensitivity almost all of the pleasurable sensitivity in some areas. Just about every part of my body has more sensitivity than the bottom 3/4's of my shaft.\n- After injury, I masturbated every week or so to see if sexual feeling was getting better and a couple weeks in, I suddenly got a sharp pain on top left shaft very close to base while masturbating. It was while I was slightly pushing my erection downwards to make a 90 degree angle (which I had done a million times before). To relieve it, I had to pull erection to belly. After this happened twice, I quit masturbating for months.\n-If I do cobra pose to stretch abs/stomach, I get dull ache at top and sides of base of penis for awhile (didn't ever happen before injury).\n-I have 1 hard vein since injury. Not the largest main vein but probably equal to the 2nd largest. It's slightly buried under the skin and runs all the way from top center at base down to the top left base of glans. My guess is it's a dorsal artery.\n\n\nAfter I quit masturbating like 2 months in, I think I made it like 3 months without it. Then after another week or 2, I stopped and probably made it like 6 months, then recently went 9 months and just started doing it again as my new Pelvic Floor therapist has instructed me to. She told me to keep everything in a comfortable position when doing it but after 9 months, anything that wants to heal would've and I should stimulate the nerves that are working.\n\n\nI've seen 3 urologists, all no help. They said they've never seen anything like it and let it heal itself.\n\nWhat I'd like to try and find out is if there's any tests or even new technologies anyone here might recommend I try. Stuff like Nerve growth factor or stem cells? Any tests that could actually locate or diagnose the problem. You know, tell me whether I have scar tissue, a partially torn ligament, compressed nerve, damaged nerve, etc. I'd like to pinpoint something because what if it is fixable? What if I could've been using some essential oil or vitamin this whole time to give a chance at healing? I can easily see a new urologist but if I do, I'd like to be prepared with a game plan on what tests I should get and why in case he's anything like the other 3 I've seen.\n\nAlso something I will mentioned real quick as a lot of people like to jump to this. This is not something that stays on my mind. This is not something that consumes me or has me depressed. I stay very busy with work and find happiness in many other ways so I can promise this issue is not mental or something that is caused by poor mental health/anxiety/depression.\n\nThank you for reading all this and bearing with me, any input is much appreciated, I promise.","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Penile injury; Any thoughts?","resp_content":"Hi OK as for your jelqing did you do the warm up? and just how much was you doing as you was still or should have been so taking things slowly, letting your penis get used to what you was doing to it.\n\nWhen you was jelqing I hope you was using lubrication, and not with an erect penis?\n\nWhere was you getting your info from?\n\nSpider vein's we all get when erect.\n\nWhite spots on your gland, is these are round the rim, they could be PPP Pearly Penile Papules, read up about them.\n\nHave you thought of having a Doppler test done? this shows blood flow in your penis, the link below should help you.\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/doppler-ultrasound/expert-answers/faq-20058452\n\nHave you had a blood test done to check your hormones? if not get one done and ask for a copy of them.\n\nLast thing that may be of help is getting a BathMate, what this will do is draw blood down your penis, said to be of help with guys who have ED, I have one it will make you feel good, but take it slowly if you get one.\n\nNOWHARD\n1\n"},{"author":"darwayne","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Hey man,","resp_content":"I followed the \"JP's beginner guide. I was very strict on using a microwaved wet rag to warm up the entire area around my penis and my pelvic region before and after jelqing. I went lightly and used baby oil as recommended. I did exactly as JP's guide lists for jelqing and just skipped all the stretching as it seemed risky and I don't care about length. I jelqed at 70% erection as suggested in every place I looked. Any time an erection arose, I waited for it to die down.\n\nYes, I've read all over the jelq forums that the spider veins are a normal side effect of jelqing and I have no issue with that. I just figured I'd mention incase it helps answer any questions.\n\nThe white spots are just blotches of random size scattered around my glans. Some on the ring, mostly scattered around the top and sides. They're not clumped in a particular area. They aren't growths, just white areas in the skins sort of like if you put pressure on your finger nail and it goes white. This was directly caused by jelqing I am 100% sure. Just strange that I haven't been able to find a single other guy that has had this. They aren't noticeable when I have more blood flow in the penis.\n\nA doppler test is something I will add to my list of tests I'd like to get. That's a good idea. I do get nocturnal erections and sometimes spontaneous ones so I don't believe I have any major vascular issues but I am curious about this hard vein running down my shaft.\n\nI have had blood work because I've always had low testosterone.

I should've been more detailed but wrongly assumed you wouldn't know much about TRT! I'm not actually on TRT although I was for about 7 months over a year ago.\n\nI'm currently on \"HCG\" and it has brought my T from 300-400 range up to over 800. So I'm producing on my own and happy I don't have to take any meds like clomid with all it's side effects to achieve proper T levels(I tried clomid before HCG, felt like hell the entire time). My libido is definitely there, my sensitivity is just dead and definitely due to either nerve damage from jelqing or nerve compression somewhere in my pelvic floor. Since I'm seeing a PF therapist, that should eventually be determined and if not, it is indeed nerve damage from jelqing.\n\nI noticed 1 or 2 blotches after the first couple jelq sessions then towards the end, I had a bunch. I figured it did something funky to the blood vessels up there some how.\n\nI'm not the only one to injure myself from jelqing and following all precautions. All penises are made different. They all develop a little different. Maybe some penises just can't take it. I'm a 4.2 inch girth guy.. Maybe skinny penises don't handle it well.\n\nI will check out your concoction!

This protects you and others from further spread of HIV infection. You can repeat the test as much as you like, but the test does not protect you from infection.\n\nWhen someone becomes infected with HIV, the antibody test (ELISA plus Western blot) turns positive within several weeks for most people. When it is said that the virus is dormant, this means that it does not cause illness for a lengthy period of time. However, it is not dormant in many other ways. The virus reproduces itself in huge numbers (hundreds of million of copies). Also, the immune system responds to the infection in various ways, including by producing antibodies, which are detected by the ELISA and Western blot tests.\n\nSo go and get tested to help calm your fears.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"georgiagail","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Panic and Worry","resp_content":"Oral sex carries an EXTREMELY low risk of HIV transmission.

With viral shedding there are NO visible symptoms but the virus is shedding and so it can be transmitted just the same as when there are lesions. However... the implication from the statistics, descriptions and anecdotal evidence, is that when there is NO outbreak and NO viral shedding, then there the virus can NOT be transmitted... is that true?\n\nThe statistics say that there is a 10% transmission rate if you don't take medication and don't use condoms, simply avoid sex during an outbreak. With condoms and suppressants, it drops to 2-4%. That's very low. However, it seems to me that this is still referring to the days when a transmission is possible due to asymptomatic shedding.

I went to my Dr. and was treated for a yeast infection. After taking Diflucan I still had symptoms and called back. A different Dr. got me in that week and tested again. The lab results showed BV and Yeast. I was treated for both, and when finished with both medications I still had symptoms and my prescription was refilled. The Flagyl prescribed for the BV gave me a yeast infection and I had to take 3 Diflucan doses to get rid of everything. After the hassle of all of this I never went back to the Dr. to see if everything actually went away.\n\nAround November this year I started noticing the same kind of discharge and was worried that the BV maybe just never went away from the 3 years prior. So, I called my OBGYN. She prescribed a total of 6 doses of Diflucan for a yeast infection that would not go away. A few weeks ago I saw a different Dr. from a different women's center. Turns out I have BV and a yeast infection. I was prescribed a cream for the yeast and Flagyl for the BV.\n\nI am wondering how, after having 2 lab tests that checked for BV, it is showing up now? Could this have developed while being treated for the yeast infections? I also don't know why I have such a hard time getting rid of these two infections. I have had the same sexual partner for 3 years now. My last question is, should I wait to use the yeast infection cream until I have finished the Flagyl? Because I know that the Flagyl will give me a yeast infection.\n\nI feel like my doctors get very frustrated because my issues keep coming back. I also worry that the medications didn't work every time I take them and I feel like I should be examined again, but I think that the doctors get frustrated that I keep coming back in for the same things.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!","like_count":"0","tags":["Women's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: BV and Yeast Infection","resp_content":"Hi Read up about natural remedies for both, lots of women turn to them, there better you and more natural.\n\nGoogle Natural remedies for YI, and the natural remedies for BV your find some are the same.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/41193/bv-and-yeast-infection"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Tears between shaft and head of penis","post_content":"About 6-8 weeks ago I rubbed the head and area below the head of my penis raw during sex.

Initially, the only thing that I could notice was an enlarged vein that circled my penis just below its head. This was only visible when I got an erection, but after a few more months the left side of my penis's foreskin had stretched to the point where there was so much extra skin, that when I would peel it back, there would still be foreskin on the left of the head of my penis, but not the right making it uneven. I now can also feel the vein below the head of my penis when it is flaccid. This has not caused me any severe pain, however I have noticed quite a bit of discomfort since this issue, as well as reduced sensitivity on the left side of my penis. I can almost describe the sensation as being numb, which is not exactly desirable...

The vaginal sex lasted about 15 seconds before I wised up and opted for a condom, however this was after a couple minutes of oral sex that was unprotected (both ways).\n\nNow, I’ve done my research and I know that what I’ve said is enough to contract an STD. In terms of symptoms, I’m generally quite an anxious person so I don’t know if a lot of it is in my head:\n\n1) I have noticed that’s I’ve been urinating very frequently the last two days. However, I’m a very frequent urinator as it is (I have a very small bladder), so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this.\n\n2) I have not necessarily noticed burning every time whilst urinating, but on the third or fourth morning after I definitely did notice a burning sensation. However, this has happened before as a one off, and I don’t feel like I’ve had the same sensation since.\n\n3) My penis does feel a little heavier than usual, but this one I can’t work out if it’s in my head. It almost feels (slightly) sore, maybe from the constant urinating.\n\nThat’s the extent of it. I know that I cannot accurately test for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea for another week, so I guess the questions I had are:\n\n- is number 3 a common STD symptom?\n- whilst I know it is entirely possible that I contracted an STD, is it possible to have these symptoms and it be something else? Or does that sound too coincidental/wishful thinking?\n- exactly how frequent is frequent urination? When I go, I don’t seem to urinate large amounts, rather just small quantities. I actually noticed this perhaps more than usual about 10-12 hours following the sex.\n\nThank you.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chlamydia","Gonorrhea"]},"responses":[{"author":"itspersonal","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Very frequent urination a week after unprotected sex","resp_content":"I'm not sure.

I ejaculated in her mouth, and then the experience was over, which I immediately regretted. This was my first time engaging in this kind of risky behaviour with someone I did not know.\n\nWhen I got home, I washed my penis with soup. I think I even put shampoo inside. I was pretty rigorous, as I felt very dirty from the behaviour. Of course, the shampoo hurt and made me feel stinging sensations at the tip of my penis.\n\nNext, I went and got myself tested on December 19 for everything imaginable. The big ones were HIV, HSV, chlamydia, gonorrhoeae, syphilis, hep B, and hep C, which all turned out negative.\n\nI felt good about that until I opened my pee hole and looked inside. The bottom wall or canal of the urethra was white in colour. It is slightly raised and it seemingly travels down the urethra tube for as far as I can see with a flashlight. I immediately panicked and realized I did all my tested way too soon.\n\nI can’t remember if I was feeling stinging inside the tip of my penis before looking inside, or if it started again after, but either way I have been feeling discomfort ever since December 15, and with the white appearance I see inside, I’m in even more discomfort.\n\nSo on December 29 (2 weeks after high risk incident), I took a test for HSV 1 and 2, and it came back negative again. On January 2 (2 weeks + 4 days), I took a test for chlamydia and gonorrhoeae, which also both came back negative again.\n\nStill, the tip of my penis was irritating me. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. My underwear was bothering me. I felt rubbing against the fabric. It was getting red on the exterior of the tip of my penis, and I was frantically always checking, touching, and squeezing open. I even tried masturbating several times through this tough experience simply to see if that would get rid of the pressure and irritation I was feeling, but it only seemed to make things worse.\n\nI was feeling like my life was over. I’ve cried myself to sleep two times. That’s how shaken up I’ve been. So I went to see a doctor on January 6 who was not mine, because I felt ashamed to see my own. My doctor is actually quite rude and makes me feel uncomfortable, always brushing me off like my problems and concerns are not worthwhile. That’s besides the point though... so I saw a doctor and she gradually looked and just told me it was my urethra and not to worry.\n\nI tried taking that to heart but I felt like she didn’t even look closely. Just peered over and probably my angling of my penis towards her visual perspective was not the right angle, because from my vantage point I could clearly see it, while she sat in her chair not getting up to try and look. So as I reassessed that moment, I regressed back to my worries.\n\nOn January 29, I went to see my doctor. He didn’t know what it was. I asked him if it’s normal? He said, “What is normal?” I said I don’t know, I’m not a doctor. He said anything can be normal. He berated me for even worrying and told me not to have sexual contact without protection, and yes I know, I get it that I screwed up. I have this mysterious irritation though with this mysterious appearance, and so I need answers. He took a swab for HSV, and I’m awaiting those results. I have another urine test to do to check for chlamydia or gonorrhoeae, but I feel like this will all come back negative again.\n\nMy doctor thinks it could be HPV. I have had genital warts before on my scrotum, but those haven’t appeared for over a year and a half, going onto two years. Never had a bad breakout of that. It was so minor. Removed with the ice freezing or whatever it was, and they haven’t returned.\n\nCould this whiteness inside my urethra really be HPV? If so, how would I get rid of that? I asked my doctor, and he said you don’t. But really? If I can’t get rid of it, will I become infertile?\n\nBasically I am looking for answers. I have no answers at this point. I’m very confused.

I started having this symptom a year ago and it’s been reoccurring every now and then. The thing is, the rash only appears on my pubic hair region. I had unprotected sexual intercourse twice before with my partner. I had a total of 3 check ups. The first time was on March 2017. I was negative for HIV but postivie for a mild STI infection. The name of the disease which I forgot was something called “cocci”, but the one in-charge said that it was just mild. I was given a medicine for it but I was not able to have a follow up check up to know if I was cured or not since I had to go abroad the next day. The penile discharged that I was experiencing was gone so I thought I got better. To be sure, some time between late April and early of May 2017, I went to the social health clinic of Manhattan in New York. I took a urine and blood test there as well as an examination on the rash. They couldn’t tell what rash it was since It was almost healed and Ibwas advised to go back when it’s still fresh so that they can get a sample. The results came back two weeks later and it says online that I was fine. There were no diseases or any STD found. I was still having the rash and that’s when I decided to go back and asked if the rash that I was having was Herpes. The personnel said that it could not be Herpes since the result I got was all clean and he said if there’s anything that I’ve got then it should have shown in their test. Based on my research online, there is a separate test for Herpes and it includes blood test which I had in the clinic but was not sure if detecting Herpes was one of it. I got back to my country and had my follow up check up some time between August and September 2017. The result was also negative for any STD including my previous infection. Also, when I’m just at home, I only wear boxers ‘til I go to bed and I just started wearing boxers last 2 years. My country also has a hot weather since I live in South-East Asia. So I think that it’s just a rash from being sweaty and exposure to bacteria.\n\nAttached to this post are the pictures of my rash on my pubic hair region.

Depending on your age, there may be another factor at play in addition to a vagina becoming less tight with age. The inside of the vagina has soft folds of skin that are called vaginal rugae. These vaginal rugae can provide a pleasant sensation against the penis. As women age, their vaginal rugae diminish and the vagina can become quite smooth thus not providing a much stimulation against the penis.\n\nWith regards to some women developing (or having) a \"loose vagina\" from natural ageing or bearing children. There are a number of option available to tighten the vagina. There's laser vaginal tightening, vaginoplasty (surgery) and there is also a silicone vaginal insert called a vejuVe Enhancer. All of these methods can enhance stimulation for both the female and the male during intercourse.\n"},{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Two things you missed christ8ine is doing kegels and there free to do once you find out how to do them on line and the other would be buy the man a Bathmate and watch it grow longer and thicker.","resp_content":""}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/30919/how-can-a-vagina-become-suddenly-loose"},{"post":{"author":"bill4more","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Please help!","post_content":"I am a 28 year old male, and for the last week have been experiencing some mild pain in the tip of my penis.

About 3 months ago I had sex with a girl from the Philippines. She was NOT a prostitute or a sex worker, just a normal girl. I used a condom every time, but one of the times we had sex the condom broke. About 6 weeks later I started experiencing some symptoms that made me think I had a urinary tract infection/ yeast infection that was unrelated to the sex i had had: Frequent urination, fungal looking rash on the penis under the foreskin. I have a history of getting these types of infections when I have a very poor diet and when I do not exercise. After noticing these symptoms I changed my diet, started exercising again, had no sexual contact or masturbation for 2 weeks, and the symptoms were all but gone when I had another sexual encounter. The day after the sexual encounter the symptoms returned along with some lower abdominal pain, testicular swelling and tenderness, and a clear but sometimes cloudy discharge from the end of my penis. I assumed the urinary tract/yeast infection was back but 2 weeks later it was still not gone and the girl I had recently had sex with informed me that she had been to the doctor and the doctor told her that she had Colpitis/Vaginitis. The doctor prescribed her \"Nifuratel and Nysfungin Vaginal Soft Capsules\" and \"Cefpodoxime Proxetil Tablets.\" I went to 10 different pharmacies looking for the Cefpodoxime but none of them had it. None of them had any doxycycline either, so I bought Ciprofloxacin. I have been taking 1g of Cipro every 12 hours for the last 12 days. After 10 days of taking the antibiotics the discharge was gone, the frequent urination was gone, but I still had the rash under the foreskin and, less often, but occasional testicular swelling and tenderness and lower abdominal pain. I masturbated for the first time 2 days ago (still taking the antibiotics) and now all of the symptoms have returned in full force along with swelling and redness around my pee hole.

Im 19 years old. I am 5'3\" and I weigh 105lbs. I just started taking birth control 5 months ago. The brand is Larissia, and they are Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl tablets. I have been having sex with my boyfriend everyday, sometimes up to 3 times a day for about six months. With breaks for a week only when Im on my period. He is the first partner I have been this way with. Before, I would have sex about once a month or less. In the beginning I had a UTI and vaginosis (probably from him being a new partner and how often we were doing it) but I got antibiotics and have been fine since then. Im really worried, though, that I have gotten really loose from having so much sex. I think it feels a lot different now. He is about 8 inches hard and 6 inches around. When we first were having sex, he would \"hit it from the back\" and it would hurt pretty bad(in a good way) because I think he was hitting my cervix/g spot. He couldnt even put it all the way in. Now, he has to put it as far in as he can in order for me to feel him hitting my cervix/ g spot. Another thing is that when I was on top of him, riding it, I used to feel it more. Especially him hitting my cervix in this position too.To me, it feels like the opening of my vagina is wider. It doesnt feel as good as it once did because my vagina doesnt feel like its gripping his penis as tight. I have heard of kegals, but I shouldnt have to do these if when we first started having sex I felt tight! And I have never had a child. Before, it felt like he was breaking me because I felt so small. I did in the beginning feel my vagina tear and it would hurt for awhile after. I never let it heal and we kept having sex. Now it doesnt even get torn. Sometimes he would try to put it in before I was fully aroused/lubricated. Could this have stretched out my labia? He says it still feels tight, which it does but not as much. I feel more open and like my cervix is higher? Is this possible? Can too much sex with a big dick make me loose? Please help!

I have had them treated by freezing multiple times throughout my life. About 5 years ago, a wart developed on my lower abdomen, about 4 inches beneath my navel. I went to a dermatologist and had it frozen. At a follow up appointment the doctor decided to scrape the remainder of it and have it tested since I have had a few skin cancers removed previously. Well, I was contacted by my doctor again today who said that the wart tested positive for HPV 6/11 which makes it a genital wart even though it was on my lower abdomen. The wart has been there for about 5 years and I have been with my wife for 19 years. I have been completely monogamous for the entire 19 years that we have been together. The doctor said I must have contracted the virus a little while before the wart showed up, so well into my marriage. She said a couple of weeks to two years maximum. She said that there is no way that the virus could have been dormant for 14 years (it has been there for 5). So, if I have been monogamous and I trust that my wife has been as well...the question is how the heck did I get it? Is it possible to transmit HPV 6/11 by touch? Any other way besides sexual contact? If not, then I must have gotten it from my wife? So assuming that she has been monogamous as well, how did she get it?

Or am I overreacting?","post_content":"Hi there, so close to 7 weeks ago, 4/5 days after having sex with a new male partner I started developing symptoms of what I thought (hoped) was a UTI. We used a condom for vaginal sex, he had a condom on for receiving oral sex, but I did not have protection when he gave me oral.\n\nIt was just a slight vaginal irritation at first. But I'm diligent with STI testing, so I got tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, bacterial vaginosis, and trich which all came back negative. I was then prescribed Cipro for a UTI since I had a dipstick test that showed bacteria and high white blood cell count. Symptoms seemed to go away then come back a couple days after finishing antibiotics. So back to the walk-in doctor I went. This time they took a urine culture and did another dip test. Dip test showed high white blood cells again. So he prescribed me Septra while I waited for the urine culture. 4 days into the antibiotics and my symptoms had worsened. Constant urge to urinate and feeling of vaginal irritation up inside me. No pain, just irritation. Hard to explain. So I went back. Culture seemed to be \"inconclusive\" due to bacterial contamination or something- he was difficult to understand. Gave another urine sample and was sent home with my THIRD antibiotic Macrobid. Symptoms started dissipating after about day 4 and seemed to go away for about a week? Maybe less, then started coming back again. Made an appt with my family doctor and he did more swabs for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trich, yeast which all came back negative again. He did a pelvic exam and didn't see any lesions inside me (unless they are further up- is that possible?). He also did a urine culture which came back negative this time. STILL having symptoms almost 7 weeks later and have now convinced myself (thank you anxiety and doctor Google) that I have urethral herpes or cancer or something. I know not all people have typical symptoms of herpes...I've been doing extensive googling and really don't know what else it could be. Getting super paranoid and anxious and would love some feedback!\n\nLowdown- Symptoms:\n- Urinary urgency- especially after peeing. Typically dwindles away a bit if I don't go pee for a while. Seems to be worse at night right before going to sleep. Doesn't wake me up though and usually feels better in the morning, until I pee a couple times, that is.\n- Inside my vagina feels \"irritated\". No pain, no discharge, no smell, no lesions/blisters/etc. Just doesn't feel right. Again, hard to explain.\n\nMeds I am currently on (if that may mean anything):\n- Alesse birth control.\n- Synthroid for hypothyroid.\n- Also I get frequent headaches so I take Advil often.\n\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated while I wait to make another appointment with my doctor!

About 18 months ago I noticed that my left ball was getting extremely red and some of the skin was starting to peel and become scaly in appearance. At about the same time I also noticed a small, pink bump that appeared on my ballsack, closish to the base of my penis. The bump was perfectly round, slightly raised, pink in color and smooth to the touch. I went to the nurse practitioner at my university (general medicine) for these issues and she diagnosed me with jock itch for my ball and genital warts. I was somewhat confused by the diagnosis of genital warts (years earlier I had gotten a HPV vaccine and I always use condoms during sex) and she admitted that she was somewhat unsure but that was what she believed it to be. Another complicating factor is that I was diagnosed with a medium sized varicocele in my left testicle at the age of 12. I was given aldara cream for the wart and lotramin for the jock itch. After 3 weeks of regimented application, neither condition changed. I went back to the same woman and she decided to treat my ball as a yeast infection and prescribed me medication accordingly (can’t remember what it was). For my pink bump they decided to freeze it off and LIBERALLY applied the cryotherapy. Another three weeks went by and my “wart” was gone and my ball had improved but still maintained a reddish color distinct from the pinkish color of my right testicle. During this time I also received a general STD test and all results were negative.\nSeveral months later I went to a urologist back at home who I had been going to for years. I explained the situation and he was convinced that it was NOT a genital wart. He was unsurprised by the diagnosis due to the fact that I was seen on a college campus which are apparently always more likely to diagnosis STDs to air on the side of caution. With regards to my ballsack problem he suggested that it was due to my extremely sensitive skin and recommended that I alter my bathroom routine and use soaps that were softer on the skin. I took his advice, and while my condition was temporarily relieved I still suffer constant irritation of my pubic region, almost EXCLUSIVELY in the area of my left testicle. To this day the testicle is still redder than my right. The vast majority of the time I experience general purpose itching that extends from my left ball up through the pubic hair region. Rarely, I also experience precise pain and irritation, however, it is ALWAYS located in the exact location where the cryotherapy was applied. The condition seems to worsen in hot, humid temperatures, after sex and after sitting for long periods of time. In the last 18 months, I have never noticed ANY irregular bumps or rashes and I check twice or more daily. I get relief when I slather the region in Eucerin cream twice daily (my current routine).\nMy personal theory is that the irritation is due in large part to a combination of my sensitive skin, medium sized vericocele, and life in a hot, humid climate (south texas) as well as an active lifestyle that results in a lot of friction in the region. I have always been somewhat of a neurotic person but for the first time in my entire life I now have a girlfriend (great timing I know) and I don’t want to put her at risk for anything. Due to my current circumstances, seeking out the help of a professional isn’t my number 1 choice but I would do it if I absolutely had to. I would appreciate any advice from people with similar experiences or help from any medical professionals out there.","like_count":"0","tags":["HPV/Genital Warts"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: STD Help","resp_content":"Hi OK lets start with this for your varicocele its a mix of mineits good for a lot of and a varicocele is one of them as its so good for your blood, see the link its a post of mine its on www.pejym.com some where else you could try.\n\nhttps://www.pegym.com/forums/exercise-health-forum/113808-nowhards-mix.html\n\nAs for your skin problem for now stick to very natural soap or even a warm sea salt a couple of times a day, but try coconut oil or even olive oil as both are very good for your skin, this you can read up on line and both good fighting a YI if its that still.\n\nBut have you ever thought of seeing a dermatologist for help for your skin problem.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/36060/std-help"},{"post":{"author":"anonymoususer99","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Risk of Stds?","post_content":"Hello, so in about september 2017 me and someone had unprotected oral sex.\n\nMe and him:\nI sucked his dick\nHe sucked my dick\nHe put both our dicks together and masturbated\nHe also gave me a handjob and i gave him a handjob\n\nThats all we did but what kind of stds am i likely to have and what is the chances of me getting one from these actions?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"georgiagail","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Risk of Stds?","resp_content":"All depends on whether your partner was infected with an STD.

This can sometimes be treated by using an inhaler prior to engaging in the activity.\n\nIt's hard to tell whether your experience is due to asthma (which happens when the breathing tubes become too narrow to allow the normal amount of oxygen into your system) or something else. It certainly sounds as if whatever is happening to you is enough to warrant a trip to your health care provider.\n\nExposure to substances to which you are allergic can also cause difficulty breathing. For example, was your partner wearing a latex condom? Allergies to latex are common. Allergic reactions become more severe with repeated exposure, so you might want to use a different type of condom, such as one made of polyurethane, or you can use the female condom, for a change (be aware that these condoms may have a slightly higher failure rate than do latex condoms). Visit your health care provider to be tested for a latex allergy, to get information on how to avoid exposure to latex (which is a component in lots of different products), and to learn how to treat a reaction, if you are truly sensitive or allergic.\n\nPanic attacks, a chemical phenomenon in your body, can also cause difficulty breathing. They can occur for any number of reasons. It's not a \"mind-over-matter\" situation that you can easily control. It's a series of chemical events that cause symptoms. Sometimes a history of sexual trauma can be a factor in panic attacks associated with sex. Caffeine, alcohol and/or other drugs (including marijuana), and certain medications may also increase a person's likelihood of having a panic attack. Your health care provider can tell you about the variety of treatments available for panic attacks, including psychotherapy, behavioral techniques for lessening the effects of a panic attack, and medications that can prevent or limit them.\n\nWhen did this start to happen? What is different? Perhaps you are holding your breath on the path to orgasm. Perhaps you don't want to orgasm for a while. Perhaps you have feelings about your partner, your life, and/or the sex you are having; feelings can have impact on sexual response.\n\nIf a health care provider rules out a medical cause for your orgasm-related symptoms, a sex therapist may be your next step, with the goal of getting back to enjoying sexual activities. In the meantime, don't strive for orgasm, just allow the pleasurable feelings to come in and be present. Pleasure, not orgasm, can be your sexual goal.\n\nJust in case your a bit mixed up reading this it was to a women but then it could also be you a man.\n\nBut there are some things you can be looking at, as orgasms are not just a women domain.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/35145/breathing-problem-of-left-side-after-ejaculation"},{"post":{"author":"calypso123456","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Urethritis / Prostatitis / Conjunctivitis lots of treaments no improvement","post_content":"Hello,\n\nI've contracted an urethritis (thick transparent penile discharge, burning and itching sensation) in January and at the same time a conjuctivitis.

This was last Sunday (9 days ago).\nI was trying to be as safe as possible given the circumstances. For what it was worth, I asked her if she had any Std's or anything and she said that she didn't and always plays safe.\nSo I put a condom on and she performed oral for about 5 minutes, then we had vaginal intercourse for another 5 minutes. When I reinserted myself about two minutes into that and think the condom broke somewhere in there and may have had unprotected vaginal intercourse for possibly 3 minutes or so before we realized. Both of us were concerned and decided that we should just end it there since the mood was gone anyway. I asked again if she had any Std's for peace of mind and she said absolutely not and that she had a family and had to make sure she stayed safe. She says its not worth being unsafe (even though it's a very risky line of work she chose, etc).\n\nStarting the next day up to present (around 8 or 9 days), I've been experiencing a mild burning in my urethra and some tenderness/pain in my testicles. It doesn't really change when I urinate and feels like that feeling when you have really acidic urine or have to urinate really badly.\n\nI got tested for Gonorrhea and Clamydia on Thursday (4 days after and both came up negative). Can you guys provide any information on what you think it may be? Chances of getting HIV is she was in fact positive?\nAnything will help. I'm going to get tested when the time frame after exposure permits, I would just like to hear anything you have to say that will help me until then.

I always feel like I'm \"cured\" and that my sex drive will continue to be strong. That never happens. After about 5 or so days, my sex drive plummets and is almost non-existent. I lose all interest in sex. I don't fantasize about having sex and feel like I'd be just fine if I never had sex again in my life. I have a difficult time even getting an erection. Even my morning erections go away or if there is one, it feels about as half as strong. This time lasts for about 2 weeks and sometimes longer.\nI talked to my doctor when I first got married at age 22. Yes, this has been going on as far back as I can remember. The doctor thought it was in my head and gave me a Viagra sample. That didn't help anything. A few years later, I talked to a urologist. He looked at me and told me that I should be able to have sex 2-3 times a night multiple days a week because I was a health young man. He threatened to inject me with something to prove that my penis was okay. I passed on that. He also offered me some Viagra. Now let me point out again that during those 5 or so days, I feel like I'm God's gift to women and have no issues at all.\nI recently talked to my primary care physician and he checked my Testosterone and it was on the lower end. He started giving me intramuscular injections of testosterone. I took it for a year with no changes to my pattern of sexual drive. It did absolutely nothing except give me headaches and so I stopped that. My sex drive continues to be hot and ice cold as described above.\nMaybe this is just who I am, but it sucks.

Still Looking for a \"Cure\"","post_content":"Hi Everyone,\n\nI've been experiencing very low libido for 3 years now. I remember the exact month my libido went away--August 2014. I was going through some stressful things in my personal life and just lost any desire for sex. Previous to that, I considered myself to have quite a high sex drive (especially compared to how I feel now). I'd always been curious about sex from an early age and had a healthy sex life from the age of 22.\n\nA few things happened in 2014 or near that time that might be responsible. I went on birth control for a month. (I hated it so could only stand it for a month--the side effects were too much for me). I also went on Lexapro in early January 2015 until September 2015 or so. During that time, I had ZERO sex drive and was physically unable to orgasm. After going off, my sex drive never really seemed to come back completely. In 2014-2015 I also began a cycle of dieting / working out very hard at times, specifically weightlifting. I still lift weights and feel that might be possibly to blame at times? I have no idea. I also began having difficulty coming to terms with the possibility of having children and that was affecting me psychologically / physically. (I've since decided it's not for me).\n\nAt this point, my husband and I are both frustrated with my lack of interest. It really has damaged our relationship, especially from his side. I've talked with my lady Dr. about this, have had blood work specifically to check hormone levels / thyroid (twice now, the only abnormal thing was low vitamin D which I've since remedied), tried counseling (with no success) and tried just forcing myself, but I just can't seem to get back those feelings I used to have. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any potential natural remedies to try? Possible reasons why I'm experiencing these things??

I am 39 years of old married with two kids. I'll begin by saying that I have testicular pain. I've been to the urologist after urologist. And they have made my life a living hell. They don't believe me. They laugh at me. It's complicated. I've been in so much pain that it has caused me to be depressed and nearly suicidal. Practically in tears. When I start having problems in my testicles, I can't sit still I am in that much pain. Then my anxiety begins to go crazy. I've tried hormone replacement like taking testosterone shots and the cream. It didn't help. I try sleeping it off. Doesn't help. Even taking a cold bath, sometimes even a hot bath. That sometimes relieves the pain. But not my much. I have trouble getting my point across, so I thought I would type it all down. I've countless sexual \"hang-ups\" and was hoping and praying that they will eventually leave. I would, however, like to clarify that whenever I view pornography I normally would masturbate to oral sex. When this occurs, it's usually once a week. I've been attempting to refrain from doing this. Too many, problems. There came a time where I would prefer masturbating than having sex. One of the problems is that I'm a lousy lover. I know I should never allow myself to feel self-conscious or inadequate in any way. When my wife and I do actually have intercourse, I struggle with keeping and maintaining my erection and by keeping stamina and hardness throughout the act. Whenever I lose my erection, I merely am discouraged and roll over and become seriously ticked off at myself, not with my wife. Because I can't stay hard enough to have sex. We've tried anal sex, it worked for a while, till all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore. Have no idea what happened. Just stopped working. Another problem I have is not getting \"satisfied\" by my wife giving me oral sex. I can't seem to get an erection. Weird, right? I am clueless. This is going to sound strange, especially coming from a male. Where men are expected to be \"sex animals\". But whenever my wife performs fellatio, I don't know how to react. I look at her. It's a very odd, and strange feeling. She has asked me once if I liked what she was doing. I couldn't answer her because I didn't know what to say. When I perform oral stimulation on my wife, I still fail to get an erection. *Sighs* Whenever I obtain an erection, and I'm really hard, it hurts like hell. Noticed the head of my penis would turn colors. The pain would start at the shaft and then move down to my testicles. My wife and I have tried reciprocal masturbation together, unfortunately, it never worked for me either. Learning to relax and eliminate distractions is something I have trouble addressing. I suppose I am size-obsessed. In my younger years, two of my ex-girlfriends would say that I had a big penis. Nonetheless, I also believed they just said that at the time, because I was with them. My wife had said I was \"big enough\" for her. Nevertheless, again, I don't think I will ever get past this. And accept me for me. My current counselor has stated that I need to learn to appreciate my body as it is. It's a task I have trouble accepting, despite my body insecurity. And she too was right, about having these sexual issues is without a doubt preventing genuine closeness between my wife and me. I am most positive.

My major issue here and concern is i seem to frequently masturbate, i wake up in the morning and im just covered in dried up cum, i have had sex while asleep but this does not happen nearly as much as the masturbation. My penis started to get raw right underneath the head of my penis as i must be rubbing alot. I finally set up a camera and it appears that i will masturbate at times on and off for hours, cumming 2 or even 3 times. I now have to sleep naked so i dont have to do as much laundry. After doing the video for 30 days straight It seems this happens mostly within the first several hours of falling asleep.\n\nMore troubling concerns is when i sleep away from home, i have stayed in Hotels and woke up with my curtains open and im naked on the bed, i have woken up with my door open and several times woken up to another person in my bed whom i did not know and finding out i had sex with a total stranger. Whats even scarier is not knowing what has happen the times i woke up with my door open and im just laying on bed naked, people have left me notes telling me they had a good time. Does anyone know how to control this? My sex drive when im asleep appears to be off the hook,to avoid getting my penis rubbed raw i now cover my penis in lotion before i fall asleep, it seems to somewhat work but i do end up rubbing the lotion mostly off. I even had to move one time out of total humiliation due to my sleepwalking and masturbating outside. I need help with this but embarrassed to ask the Dr i mean what do i say>? What will she offer to do? Is there test or medication that can help?\nI am so freaked out over this, just wondering what i have done now over the years or who i have done it with, i stay often in hotels and the door open has happen so many times.

It is possible that some yellow-tinted urine can mix with semen, which would give semen a yellow tint or cast.\n• Jaundice: This results when the liver has difficulty breaking down bilirubin, a by-product of red blood cell destruction. Jaundice most commonly causes yellowing of the eyes but can cause the skin and the semen to appear yellow too.\n• Abnormally high white blood cells: Inflammation can produce excess white blood cells. These can be released via the semen, a condition known as pyospermia or leukocytospermia. Additional white blood cells can cause semen to appear yellow. These can be the result of an infection.\n• STIs: A sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia, herpes, or gonorrhea may cause yellow semen. In this instance, a man's semen may also have an unpleasant smell.\n• Dietary changes: Eating foods that contain dyes can cause yellow semen. The smell of ejaculate may also change if a man eats strong-smelling foods, such as garlic, onions, asparagus, or broccoli.\n• Infrequent ejaculation: If a man has not ejaculated in some time; the semen is more likely to have mixed with urine.\n\nHope it helps you.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/32256/semen"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"STD Question","post_content":"My partner tested positive for chlamydia, but I tested negative.

Sometimes, I have already experienced problems getting and holding an erection, but such symptoms were triggered mainly by anxiety, stress, depression and similar reasons. Several last times I could not get the desired erection, irrespective of all the things I tried. Therefore, I started searching the Internet in hope to find good advice. However, everything I found was the recommendation to address the doctor and get impotence treatments.\nVisiting your healthcare specialist and telling him about sexual disorders sounded weird for me and very embarrassing, to tell you the truth, so I decided to keep searching. At some point I came across the online drugstore, claiming to fight erectile complications fast and effectively. And the most beneficial thing there was free Viagra samples . The offer was extremely tempting, as I did not have to pay for the medication or similar issues. The only things I had to do were to make my order and cover delivery expenses.\nI did it all and was waiting for the medication. Definitely, I had different thoughts but didn’t want to rush. Finally, in a few days, the medication was at my doorstep. Everything was fully anonymous. There wasn't even my name on the parcel. So, after consulting the online doctor, I took a single Viagra pill. It was around an hour before pre-planned sex, since I tried to follow all the instructions. How impressed I was when finally after many failed attempts I got a hard erection, which lasted for over 4 hours.\nWhen the trial pack was over, I addressed the same pharmacy and bought another pack of this magic pill.

I had done so once for 3 days straight. The third day felt sort of stiff and tight at and around the base of my penis. I was able to ejaculate and thought maybe it was just from doing it excessively.\n\nI continued on with business for the rest of the night.\n\nThe fourth day (or third night) was odd in that I did ejaculate, but also had gotten horny no more than 14 hours later during the middle of the night from the previous session.\n\nThat was when I could feel the stiffness again. Only this time it felt worse, almost like a very tight stiffness or maybe \"cramp\" if I could climax...\n\n...I felt sort of tired from stroking and trying to maintain an erection over the course of say 30-40 minutes.\n\nI was able to ejaculate...but as soon as I \"released\" my semen, I felt this overly exciting sensational feeling, that turned painful and uncontrollable within seconds. The pain was felt at the base and felt pain shoot up to my neck and parts of the front and sides of my head/brain.\n\nI couldn't control myself with the pain felt in both places and this sensation feeling that is normal during such sexual activity. It almost felt like maybe it was \"seizure-like\" up in my aforementioned frontal part of the head/brain and sides. All parts sort of felt \"locked\" up for the duration of this event.\n\nAfterwards, I felt so nervous and worried about what could had just happened. I didn't black out or anything. I didn't feel anywhere near tired. I was up for the rest of the night practically scared and reminiscing the feelings.\n\nI talked to my general doc about it. IIRC he thinks it may be related to an urinary infection? Online posts suggest that my testicles or body parts couldn't reproduce certain chemicals/substances from over doing it(?)\n\nI waited for roughly a month for anything to subside teaching myself not to stroke. Yesterday I gave at it for the first time since and I only felt the base sort of tighten up again, but not *as* bad.\n\nWhat could be the issue(s)?

I fully intend to never go without a condom with a new partner again. I'm really angry with myself.\n\nI am going to go for a full STD test soon. Anything bacterial that I can clear up with antibiotics I'm not too worried about.

Working in a bar sometimes I have come home and passed out fully dressed as soon as I've sat on the bed from tiredness which obviously hasn't let the area breathe.\n\nHowever I know these symptoms can be associated with STDs and I'm kind of worried.

I thought I saw some bumps that could be herpes sores but I've just shaved so I don't know if I could be from that as they are in awkward places that are difficult to shave and can lead to ingrown hairs. I have always had pretty sensitive skin all over my body, so any itchy parts are very red and sensitive.\n\nAlso the bumps around the vaginal opening, I'm not sure what these are? They're not sores, they just seem to be bumps that appeared I can't remember when (before the unprotected sex). Genital warts?

OK\n\nYou take 3 teaspoonful’s each morning first thing, you wash each spoonful down with water, before anything else just after you get up, one thing it will warm you up with this mix, which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic, just do a whole head, chopped fine, and keep in olive oil, with this you add dried parsley, a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix, you can also add dried oregano, you just add a teaspoonful on top of the CP an turmeric mix, just mix into the top take as said.\n\nThe Parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your Cholesterol down, you can also add some oregano in as well as its good for erections.\n\nPlease do keep both jars in the fridge, keeps a lot better that way.\nA good tip is do not fill you jar to the top leave about half an inch, its the tomato paste it expands from the olive oil, it then push's red oil out of the jar, and loves to explode out from under the lid as you open it, messy.\n\nNow if you google and read up about all above, there very good for ED, your cholesterol, heart and it clears blocked arteries and veins, good at lowering HBP, prostate, prostatitis, varicocele and RA, garlic is also very good for your blood, so along with the CP and turmeric with BP, your be doing your body the world of good.\n\nTurmeric is a great way of fighting and lowering your triglyceride numbers when you have high cholesterol, and turmeric is also a way of fighting certain cancers.\n\nTurmeric has some fantastic uses, you will be amazed at, like so many herbs and spices do.\n\nNow if your on any kind of blood thinner's don't take the Turmeric as its a blood thinner as well, means your blood will get to thin.\n\n\nAt first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day for 2 weeks then just 2 times once first thing and the second before a meal for 2 weeks, then just once a day first thing in the mornings, great way to start the day.\n\nAnd yes have had ED now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone.\nSo do hope this helps you.\n\nGood Luck\n\nNOWHARD\n\nPS This really needs a 12 week trail, to see if its going to work for you, if its for RA do increase it up, the stronger it is the better it works for you.\n\nDon’t forget to up the amount of CP and turmeric as you go on.\n\nNow for me, these days as its almost around 7 years being on this mix, I do a standard mix which has 4 rounded desert spoons of cayenne pepper and turmeric in it, and l mixed up, then daily I put some more olive oil on the top, add the 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper then a heaped teaspoon of CP and the same of turmeric add on the heaped teaspoon of garlic and mix this in the top layer and I now take 4 teaspoons of the mix, some days it can get me but most days I'm ok\nas for supplements its L-Arginine Tribulus, L-Carnitine, DHEA and just some daily vits, but I do wash them down with a boric acid mix, boric acid has the tag of being the poor mans Viagra, a standard mix is a 1/4 teaspoon in a litre of water and drink through the day, I mix at a bit stronger as I only take it first thing in the mornings, but as they say every little helps .\n\nBe warned some days my mix will make your stools a bit on the lose side, it does me, but I do not worry over it.\n\nThe last piece of info is I do have ground down green tea, with ground down natural Tribulus which I can buy here in Greece I can make a teapot last 2 days by just adding some extra, then have 2 days on black tea, I drink both with honey and lemon two more things that are very good for your blood, of a night I have 2 squares of 70% bark chocolate, something else that's so good for your blood, I think like I have said above get your blood working for you, and your about 2/3 of the way to getting some really good erections.\n\nI don't think this is in here but have warn a *** ring 24/7 just after things was getting better just to give that extra hardness, I have a Hardwear Ice from my hardwear, its a Pyrex full package ring, great to wear.\n\nI get good nocturnal erections that wake me up, and lots of morning woods not bad for a guy who will soon be hitting 70.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/30924/erectile-dysfunction"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Huge blood clot","post_content":"So, I was 24 days late starting my period.

I have a couple of friends l made in Zimbabwe and we had a night out at a bar and brothel in Harare 3 days ago. I had a couple of drinks and l danced with a prostitute. We went to the back rooms and l started to finger her. I usually bite my nails. I fingered her and then she got a condom and put it on me. Since l was struggling to maintain an erection l had difficulty in actually having sex with her and at times l would not properly penetrate and she had to guide me I, in 1 or 2 minutes l ejaculated and she got my penis out rolled off the condom and wiped me off with a tissue. She rolled me on another condom and l tried to have a second round but failed as l was not erect and decided to end it all. I have been having nightmares and anxiety and stress for the last couple of days. I was not fully erect on both occasions and on the last round the condom slipped a bit to cover about half the penis as l was not hard  but l am sure the head of the penis was covered. My foreskin never rolled back on both instances and we did not have rigorous sex with little penetration as l was not hard. I am now scared about catching HIV from this one time encounter and scared because l also fingered her the entire time putting my fingers and pulling them out frequently but not for long. I am reaaly scared l went to a doctor on Monday morning and he said l was at no risk at all and there was no need to put me up on PEPs. He recommended that if l need peace of mind l come through in 2 weeks time and have a test done for HIV. He says that test will be conclusive. He said there was also no risk for stis given the encounter but if need be l will have tests done for stis in 2 weeks too although l will have another test for stis at 4 weeks after exposure to conclude.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Did l get HIV from this encounter or other STIs l never kissed her that l am sure just played with one boob only. There was little body contact and l was on top of her the entire time.\n2.

A couple days after that the same patch of skin turned red and began to burn and now I also had stinging in the tip of my penis. I went to my GP who told be to try Lotrimin, which I did for a couple weeks with no results. I went back and he prescribed me an oral anti-fungal which appeared to help things a little bit but ultimately the stinging came back. My GP thought that it may be nerve issues and prescribed me Gabapentin(sp?), which hasn’t helped either.\n\nFinally, I asked for a referral to a Urologist, who told me that he could see no cause for concern and basically told me to”wait it out”.\n\nThe weird thing about this is, to look at my penis, there is no appearance of any real issue (though the pain is always present) unless I were to touch the foreskin and irritate it a little. The hole of my penis looks slightly red and inflamed to me.\n\nDoes anyone know what this could be? Pain in the penis tip and left side only? My follow up appointment isn’t until January and I can’t live with this for much longer.

Okay, here we go:\n\nLet me start off by saying that I was identified female at birth, and was born with unambiguous female genitalia.\n\nMy development was pretty unremarkable. As a child, I was a tomboy, but I also enjoyed typically \"feminine\" things like dolls and makeup.\n\nAt age 14, I began puberty. I got my period and it was so regular, you could set your watch by it. However, other female characteristics which come with puberty did not happen for me, one primary example being the lack of breast development.\n\nThen, by age 17, everything began to change. My periods became excruciating and irregular. I began growing facial hair. I sang in my school's choir (glee club, basically) and when I started my senior year, I sang as an alto. Halfway through the year, my range had dropped to tenor. Basically, in a sense, I had both a female and a penis-less male puberty.\n\nAs I grew older and older, my facial hair became more prominent, my voice dropped to a lower and lower register, and now, at age 35, my periods are non-existent. I was very loosely diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). I say \"loosely\" because no general practitioner or gynecologist has ever been able to find any significant cystic formations on my ovaries.\n\nOne thing my spouse noticed once, early on in our relationship, when we were having sex, is that my clitoris is located far lower than it should be. It is located more where it would be if it were a penis as opposed to a clitoris.\n\nSo, I know you're wondering what my question is.\n\nI've seen documentaries and read a great deal of information about the different ways intersexuality reveals itself. One of these I've heard about is what is known as being \"chromosomally intersex\", where the individual potentially has unambiguous genitals, but they are intersex at the chromosome level, presenting with say, XY chromosomes, even though they appear outwardly to be female, or XX chromosomes though they appear to be male, or even XXY, and countless other variations.\n\nMy question is this: Is there any possible way that I could be intersex at the chromosome level, even though it may not have manifested itself in an explicitly physical manner, such as having unambiguous genitals or internal testes, etc? Also, how would I go about finding out if this is really what's going on?\n\nBecause I feel so utterly like neither sex (male nor female), I identify as \"gender non-conforming\", but I can't shake the feeling deep down in my soul that there's more to my physical sex.\n\nPlease, I ask only respect from those who respond to my question. I have been through a great deal in regards to my physical sex and gender identity, and there are other variables as well. I am a nearly life-long sexual abuse/assault survivor, and I struggle with PTSD, as well as DID (dissociative identity disorder) because of it. Even this might subconsciously play into my gender identity issues, but I don't know.\n\nAll that being said, if you are respectful and show empathy towards me, I will most certainly offer you the same.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this wall of text, and thank you, in advance, to those who offer me advice, support, and guidance in this matter.\n\nPS: Attached are two photos of what I look like at this very moment, to show the amount of facial hair growth I'm talking about.","like_count":"0","tags":["Women's Issues","Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Addie","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Secretly intersex?","resp_content":"Thank you for sharing your story here.

A few things went wrong: we used a condom but discovered that a bit of semen had seeped out the bottom and weren’t sure if any had made its way up, I had some mild diarrhea the day before and that morning (shortly after taking my birth control pill) which we read could affect the effectiveness of the pill, and I was on day 8 of my period (it had just ended 2 days prior) but found online that it was still possible to get pregnant at that point in the cycle. We didn’t want to take any chances, and thought better to be extra safe than sorry. 8 days later I got my period, which was 2 weeks early.

I have a question about digestion. You know the old saying \"You are what you eat\"? I understand it to be true, in a sense. If you eat fat, your body stores it. You eat protein to build muscles. Caffeine and alcohol effect your blood. My question is about swallowing semen. My girlfriend was a promiscuous lady. What happens to the semen and sperm of the past lovers she had? Did her body absorb it? Did any of the semen become part of her and her cells? She's particularly overweight, if that helps. Does that form a basis for more parts of the semen to be taken in and absorbed into fatty cells? What about the sperm cells themselves? Do they get passed out during urination or bowel movements? I know there are vitamins in semen, among other \"good\" things for the body (it's almost like the internet is TELLING girls to swallow and eat semen). How long do those things stay as part of one's body before being burned and renewed by another source (ie: In the sense of when you take your daily dose of B12 and you take more than you need, your body passes what you don't. But in a few days without B12 your body will take on more if you give it. What happened to all the B12 your body had in it?)? We talk of having children but I cannot fathom having a child grow in a vessel tainted by, not just the living DNA of other men, but the \"healthy substances\" contained in mucus she ate from the penis' of other men. It completely disgusts me thinking about it. I don't know how to tell her without insulting her and I've honestly considered getting a vasectomy without her knowledge to prevent a pregnancy with her.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Semen Digestion","resp_content":"Counselling, ASAP.

It usually last just for about 1 to 2 days and then ceases. The bleeding will normally subside as the body adapts to the new hormonal levels in the blood.\n\nImplantation bleeding is normally very light and brown or pinkish in color. Because very little blood is shed during implantation, it takes some time for the body to release the blood. As it makes its way out, it ages and turns a brownish color.

It was full of the bacteria. I had to have cleanings & dressing changes frequently, many times a day and they had to put a tube in my arm for the super strong medicine to kill it. The medicine destroyed my inside of my vein because it was so caustic, so they had to take me into surgery and put one in by my heart and I had a dangling tube coming out from between my boobs when I woke up, and a 1inch cut where they put it in up by my collar bone to thread down to my heart so the heart could pump and disburse the medicine quickly before it could burn up more tissue in my veins or arteries.\n\nI had that in me for fours months and had a nurse come to my house twice a day for the four months to give me the IV of medicine to kill the bacteria that was trying to kill me.

She means everything to me. She is sexy, smart, and just all around amazing. We have built a great, strong relationship together. We waited about 3 months into the relationship before we became sexual. Everything was fine for quite a while.

I have noticed that if she let's me go down on her for some reason that gets and keeps me aroused. Probably because I love doing it. She is timid about that type of thing though. She likes it but doesn't have a lot of experience receiving so it's new to her.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is does anyone have any REAL suggestions.

My first husband had it and didn't know it either, and we first thought the same thing, that is was a friction rub. (This was in the early 70's). Later I started getting at first a tingling in an area and then a few days later that would break out into a blister type sore and the whole process would take about a week. I never had a very bad breakout and haven't had it in over twenty years now. I take Valtrex every morning and have no side effects from it. I want to stop taking it since it's been so long since I had an outbreak, but I'd rather keep taking it than get another outbreak, so I keep taking it. You need to figure out who gave it to you and let them know so they don't continue to spread it. And don't be angry with them either because they most probably didn't know either and thought whatever their symptoms were were an ingrown hair or a sexually rubbed raw area too. Be aware of your body and never ever have sex if anything feels or looks different. Men: it's easier to know because it's all on the outside. Try to be aware of when you first get that tingling sensation and refrain from sex completely until after a few days after ALL symptoms have disappeared.\nI was married after my first husband, (who gave it to me), for 11 years to my second husband and he never got it thanks to me being well aware of my body. I'd always tell him if I felt anything coming before the skin was even open or blistered, the tingly feeling always came first and that's when I'd stop being sexual, which made me never give it to him, or anyone else.\nI frankly don't know why it keeps getting transferred to other people, unless the ones who have it are ignorant of their bodies and/or the symptoms, but if they would go get it checked, they would know (or SHOULD know) and take appropriate steps to stop its continuing spread. YOU now have to do the same thing, and not spread it. Just stay keenly aware of any changes in your feelings in your gentian areas, and refrain from sexual activity during that time. It doesn't mean you can't satisfy your partner or they can't help you have intimacy, just not penetration or oral which will transfer it. Always keep clean and wash your hands with good germ killing soap after handling yourself, because you can spread it to your eyes from your hands. You can't get it from toilet seats.\nLook it up on WebMD, the symptoms are spelled out and there will be pictures and treatments as well. It's not the end of the world, even tho you're probably feeling overwhelmed and ashamed, don't. You didn't do anything wrong and chances are your partner who gave it to you didn't either. You'd be doing them a service by letting them know in a kind and sympathetic way, not in an attacking angry way. Unless they are a psycho they didn't do it to you on purpose.\nSo first get informed, then get treated, then be careful not to continue to spread it. I've had it since my early twenties and I'm 65 now and have a full and healthy sex life, and have never passed it to anyone. Most importantly don't beat yourself up over it. When it's there just think of it as a temporary inconvenience, like women get their periods, it lasts for about a week, and then it's gone. If the pills work for you as well as they have for me you'll be fine. Good luck and get treated!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/22377/herpes"},{"post":{"author":"bluddydouce","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Arousal Problems :(","post_content":"I separated from my wife of 16 years in July 2016. I went over 13 months without entering into any sort of relationship with another woman. The prospects just weren't there, and the time away from dating did me a lot of good. However, I've recently met a woman (over a month ago) who may very well be 'soulmate' material. The physical and emotional attraction has been through the roof. We are both extremely sexual people as well. We've had sex 5 times now in just over a week, but there were 8 actual attempts. I've had trouble forming an erection 3 times, and even in the 5 times I was successful, the erections have been nowhere near as full and hard as they've been in the past. My levels of desire could not be any higher for this woman. The sex (that we were able to have) has been amazing. Luckily for me, she is incredibly patient and understanding. I am seeing my doctor on Thursday this week, and am wondering whether I should bring this up, and discuss ED medication? Request bloodwork? Or is it, as I suspect, all in my head? Can anybody here relate to this situation and share how you were able to overcome it? I know it is a pretty radical change for me.

OK\n\nYou take 3 teaspoonful’s each morning first thing, you wash each spoonful down with water, before anything else just after you get up, one thing it will warm you up with this mix, which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic, just do a whole head, chopped fine, and keep in olive oil, with this you add dried parsley, a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix, you can also add dried oregano, you just add a teaspoonful on top of the CP an turmeric mix, just mix into the top take as said.\n\nThe Parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your Cholesterol down, you can also add some oregano in as well as its good for erections.\n\nPlease do keep both jars in the fridge, keeps a lot better that way.\nA good tip is do not fill you jar to the top leave about half an inch, its the tomato paste it expands from the olive oil, it then push's red oil out of the jar, and loves to explode out from under the lid as you open it, messy.\n\nNow if you google and read up about all above, there very good for ED, your cholesterol, heart and it clears blocked arteries and veins, good at lowering HBP, prostate, prostatitis, varicocele and RA, garlic is also very good for your blood, so along with the CP and turmeric with BP, your be doing your body the world of good.\n\nTurmeric is a great way of fighting and lowering your triglyceride numbers when you have high cholesterol, and turmeric is also a way of fighting certain cancers.\n\nTurmeric has some fantastic uses, you will be amazed at, like so many herbs and spices do.\n\nNow if your on any kind of blood thinner's don't take the Turmeric as its a blood thinner as well, means your blood will get to thin.\n\n\nAt first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day for 2 weeks then just 2 times once first thing and the second before a meal for 2 weeks, then just once a day first thing in the mornings, great way to start the day.\n\nAnd yes have had ED now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone.\nSo do hope this helps you.\n\nGood Luck\n\nNOWHARD\n\nPS This really needs a 12 week trail, to see if its going to work for you, if its for RA do increase it up, the stronger it is the better it works for you.\n\nDon’t forget to up the amount of CP and turmeric as you go on.\n\nNow for me, these days as its almost around 7 years being on this mix, I do a standard mix which has 4 rounded desert spoons of cayenne pepper and turmeric in it, and l mixed up, then daily I put some more olive oil on the top, add the 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper then a heaped teaspoon of CP and the same of turmeric add on the heaped teaspoon of garlic and mix this in the top layer and I now take 4 teaspoons of the mix, some days it can get me but most days I'm ok\nas for supplements its L-Arginine Tribulus, L-Carnitine, DHEA and just some daily vits, but I do wash them down with a boric acid mix, boric acid has the tag of being the poor mans Viagra, a standard mix is a 1/4 teaspoon in a litre of water and drink through the day, I mix at a bit stronger as I only take it first thing in the mornings, but as they say every little helps .\n\nBe warned some days my mix will make your stools a bit on the lose side, it does me, but I do not worry over it.\n\nThe last piece of info is I do have ground down green tea, with ground down natural Tribulus which I can buy here in Greece I can make a teapot last 2 days by just adding some extra, then have 2 days on black tea, I drink both with honey and lemon two more things that are very good for your blood, of a night I have 2 squares of 70% bark chocolate, something else that's so good for your blood, I think like I have said above get your blood working for you, and your about 2/3 of the way to getting some really good erections.\n\nI don't think this is in here but have warn a *** ring 24/7 just after things was getting better just to give that extra hardness, I have a Hardwear Ice from my hardwear, its a Pyrex full package ring, great to wear.\n\nI get good nocturnal erections that wake me up, and lots of morning woods not bad for a guy who will soon be hitting 70.\n\nNOWHARD\n"},{"author":"bluddydouce","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Wow.

This is pretty embarrassing but curious if i need to go see my Gyno. My boyfriend and I were having sex, as we normally would but I was slightly dry towards the end, which left me pretty sore the next day. It almost seemed to get worse as the day went and especially when I peed. It would burn REALLY bad, only on the actually skin that felt like it had been burned or torn. (Kind of like what a rug burn feels like, very tender to touch). Throughout the day it wasn't too bad but every time I peed that part of my skin would burn and sting, bad. At first the burning sensation was only felt if I touched it, peed or wiped, but now when I wipe there's a little bit of blood, from when I pat dry. After doing some research it seems like I have a vaginal tear from dry sex. What should I do? Will it heal on its own? I put neosporin on it the first day and the. Read that I shouldn't, if it's internal, which it is. Are there any over the counter products I should use?

OK\n\nYou take 3 teaspoonful’s each morning first thing, you wash each spoonful down with water, before anything else just after you get up, one thing it will warm you up with this mix, which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic, just do a whole head, chopped fine, and keep in olive oil, with this you add dried parsley, a couple of good desert spoonful’s and mix, you can also add dried oregano, you just add a teaspoonful on top of the CP an turmeric mix, just mix into the top take as said.\n\nThe Parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your Cholesterol down, you can also add some oregano in as well as its good for erections.\n\nPlease do keep both jars in the fridge, keeps a lot better that way.\nA good tip is do not fill you jar to the top leave about half an inch, its the tomato paste it expands from the olive oil, it then push's red oil out of the jar, and loves to explode out from under the lid as you open it, messy.\n\nNow if you google and read up about all above, there very good for ED, your cholesterol, heart and it clears blocked arteries and veins, good at lowering HBP, prostate, prostatitis, varicocele and RA, garlic is also very good for your blood, so along with the CP and turmeric with BP, your be doing your body the world of good.\n\nTurmeric is a great way of fighting and lowering your triglyceride numbers when you have high cholesterol, and turmeric is also a way of fighting certain cancers.\n\nTurmeric has some fantastic uses, you will be amazed at, like so many herbs and spices do.\n\nNow if your on any kind of blood thinner's don't take the Turmeric as its a blood thinner as well, means your blood will get to thin.\n\n\nAt first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day for 2 weeks then just 2 times once first thing and the second before a meal for 2 weeks, then just once a day first thing in the mornings, great way to start the day.\n\nAnd yes have had ED now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone.\nSo do hope this helps you.\n\nGood Luck\n\nNOWHARD\n\nPS This really needs a 12 week trail, to see if its going to work for you, if its for RA do increase it up, the stronger it is the better it works for you.\n\nDon’t forget to up the amount of CP and turmeric as you go on.\n\nNow for me, these days as its almost around 7 years being on this mix, I do a standard mix which has 4 rounded desert spoons of cayenne pepper and turmeric in it, and l mixed up, then daily I put some more olive oil on the top, add the 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper then a heaped teaspoon of CP and the same of turmeric add on the heaped teaspoon of garlic and mix this in the top layer and I now take 4 teaspoons of the mix, some days it can get me but most days I'm ok\nas for supplements its L-Arginine Tribulus, L-Carnitine, DHEA and just some daily vits, but I do wash them down with a boric acid mix, boric acid has the tag of being the poor mans Viagra, a standard mix is a 1/4 teaspoon in a litre of water and drink through the day, I mix at a bit stronger as I only take it first thing in the mornings, but as they say every little helps .\n\nBe warned some days my mix will make your stools a bit on the lose side, it does me, but I do not worry over it.\n\nThe last piece of info is I do have ground down green tea, with ground down natural Tribulus which I can buy here in Greece I can make a teapot last 2 days by just adding some extra, then have 2 days on black tea, I drink both with honey and lemon two more things that are very good for your blood, of a night I have 2 squares of 70% bark chocolate, something else that's so good for your blood, I think like I have said above get your blood working for you, and your about 2/3 of the way to getting some really good erections.\n\nI don't think this is in here but have warn a *** ring 24/7 just after things was getting better just to give that extra hardness, I have a Hardwear Ice from my hardwear, its a Pyrex full package ring, great to wear.\n\nI get good nocturnal erections that wake me up, and lots of morning woods not bad for a guy who will soon be hitting 70.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/20922/a-strange-spot-on-semen"},{"post":{"author":"penbook385","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Sex after Radical Prostatectomy","post_content":"5 years ago I needed my Prostate removed after tests indicated cancer, my Urologist was unable to spare my nerves around the gland, I have a reduced orgasm but often it feels very satisfying, I am concerned because I will always erect what I believe is urine during sex, is this common is it the same as urine?

A minuscule amount. Stop bleeding after 2 wipes. I figured it was because I was too rough and didn't use any sort of lube. Also around that time, I was masturbating maybe twice a day. Shortly after this particular instance, I start to noticed my glands were red and raise a bit and inflamed. From a distance, it looked like a rash but up close I noticed tiny bumps.\nAs you can see from the photos the tip of the penis head starts off smooth and the texture starts to look bumpy as you go down and then smooth again. It seems the rough texture is concentrated in that specific region of the penis head. I would like to say I didn't notice it before but I hadn't looked at my penis that closely until I realized there was slight blood after I masturbated. I would also like to say I remember the penis head being smooth all the way around and don't think I had those bumps previously but at the same time I didn't examine my penis with as much scrutiny before so it may have been there previously without me noticing.\n\nI initially thought I had balanitis because I am uncircumcised and the inflammation didn't seem to go down nor the redness and I also noticed the bumps. Also, I'm consistently in the gym so I figured the sweat would be an ideal environment for balanitis, yeast, thrush. I start using Lotrimin for jock itch. The redness has gone down and not as red as previously but I still notice the bumps. If I was to have sex or masturbate the inflammation would return but would go down. Although it's not as red as previously It's just that area always seems to be redder than the rest of the penis head. I wanted to know is this a cause for concern. I'm still using the Lotrimin cream as the directions state to use it for 2 weeks. If I pull my foreskin all the way back you can see that the area looks somewhat like a scar or an abrasion. From a distance now it seems as if the penis head is wrinkled in that region but if I pull back the foreskin and examine closer with the phone there are small bumps.\n\nThe bumps are painless as well as the head of the penis, I have no discharge, it does not itch. No pus. No boils or blisters, no pain when I urinate. Other than the appearance of the penis head I feel fine. I uploaded pictures as well. The pictures are from a very close angle. I attached multiple pics from various angles. I plan on scheduling an STD check sometime this week but wanted to know if there is anything particular I should check for? Is this normal? Is this a cause for concern? Is there anything I can use to help it go down? Should I use a different cream? Anything would help.

Here is my situation: I am in a long distance relationship. While my girlfriend was away I had been unfaithful and had slept with one other woman (unprotected) a week before my GF's return home.\n\nWhen my gf came back I didnt feel any symptoms. However after 2 weeks or so I felt symptoms of yeast infection. However, just to be sure I went to see a doctor and got my urine tested, and Chlamydia and gonorrhea were negative. So I assumed that it was yeast and had used some cream for treatment. Over two weeks the symptoms still existed which explained to me that it wasnt yeast infection.\n\nI only had sex two times with my GF over this time period. I thought it was safe after receiving negative results from my STD tests. However since my symptoms continued I visited my doctor again and he wanted to test for Ureaplasma Urealyticum and Mycoplasma, which I was tested positive.\n\nAfter I had sex with my GF two times, she had symptoms of Yeast Infection. This was her first time having symptoms of this kind. As she is a nurse, she naturally thought that it was yeast infection and treated her self with over the counter cream. After 1 day of cream usage, her symptoms were gone.\n\nHere are my concerns and questions:\n\n1. What is the transmission rate of Ureamasma Urealyticum.

It went away though, and I was completely fine for the next two days. I then think I developed a bladder infection because it hurt whenever I urinated. A day after that I started experiencing a really painful feeling down there and when I took a look, I saw that there were tears around my vulva and it looked like some sort of sores. It has spread some more until now, and hasn't gotten any better. I was on a few antibiotics at once and also used a cortisone cream for the tears/sores down there. I have a white-ish yellow discharge that looks kind of like jelly. I saw a doctor today and he said it could possibly be genital herpes. The sores/tears are still very painful and I can barely sit down without being in pain. When I look down there, using my phone's flash the tears are quite yellow in colour.

I started 72 hours ago and have seen a big improvment so far, im guessing it will take 7-10 days total. Likely longer if you have an extreme case of it.\n\nI dont know about pricing in E.

You could use something like coconut oil instead of jojoba if its expensive or unobtainable.\n\nAnd this one.\n\nTea tree oil is an excellent homeopathic anti-fungal & antiseptic treatment for a variety of skin disorders.

I have little to no desire for sex and I don't really get erections except occasionally, mostly in the morning. I feel numb down there most of the time especially when I'm not at home and might occasionally feel sexually aroused but it's not really all that intense and dies out soon.\nI'm currently studying at a university and I really don't have much motivation to study on time and to generally do things I should do on time, on time. I keep stalling and delaying what I should do simply because of a severe lack of motivation and a feeling of apprehension. I feel fatigued and lazy all the time. I also have a lack of self confidence about certain things which makes me on edge when someone points out something negative about me.\nI pretend to be interested in girls when I'm with my friends even though I don't really feel much. Even my family doesn't know about it. I come from a culture where you don't really talk about having a girlfriend or boyfriend publicly even if you do, and if you do most of them refrain from engaging in sex for religious reasons. As such it's not really seen as all that unusual that I don't have a girlfriend. My friends just think I don't really make an effort to get to know a girl because I'm just too scared to approach one but the reality is very different. My family just thinks I'm being a \"good boy\".\nI was pretty into girls and thinking about sex when I was 13-16. Something happened when I was 16 and I lost interest and then from that point onward my testicles became smaller and softer and now I'm 21...\nI really need some advice here on what I should do at this point. I'm really confused and worried. I've taken 5 years because the thought of bringing up something like to someone even to family especially in my country would be horribly embarrassing. My family really loves me and I love them but this is too much...

I married 2more times and had several boyfriends, all WITH herpes, and NO ONE got it from me! Frankly, I don't understand how anyone passes this along because you certainly KNOW when it's \"coming on\" or in the beginning stage and simply refrain from doing anything sexual during that time and while it's there. You'll have symptoms FIRST like a strange tingling or \"pinch\" kind of thing where it will break out...STOP all sex when his begins! Be AWARE of your body and check yourself when you use the restroom, if you use your head, you WILL KNOW!\n\nNOW...for the GOOD NEWS... that medicine the doc gave you? I've been taking it for years! I take it every morning (NO side effects) and I haven't had a break out in many many years, sex or no sex, it just stops it from breaking out. Other tips: stress is a factor in bring it on, so is yelling and fighting with someone! When your body is in that state, it will make it happen a few days later, so be MELLOW and keep control of your actions and don't be a drama queen.\nFriction/irritation can also make it come on so make sure your girl is lubricated before you enter her, many many ways of doing that! I won't give you a sex course, just use your TOP head always, not your \"little\" head, take your time and do \"it\" right and you'll have no issues! Get an RX for your med and take it faithfully every morn when you first get up and you'll have a long nad satisfying sex life like I've had! I've NEVER given it to anyone by following those tips and being good about taking the med and paying attention to my body. I NEVER engage in ANY sex of any kind if I have ANY kind of \"irritated\" area on my genitals from anything! Let whatever it is go away and then you'll be fine! Just remember...someone gave it to YOU and don't be an assshole and pass it along! Care enough about your sex partners to get to know them before sex and if you share what I've told you, they will not be scared and run screaming from you, but thank you for caring, and being honest, and knowing your own body and what it's telling you. OKAY? Feel free to let your girlfriend read this, it might make her feel more comfortable with you, and she can even be a plus in watching for irregular spots/areas on your private parts, and just STOP doing that if anything is \"different\" than your day to day skin looks. Now relax, and love being alive, it could be MUCH WORSE! Have fun, and be careful with OTHER people's lives! (Oh, and tell the person who gave it to you they have it, and give them these tips to keep from spreading it AGAIN! She most likely didn't KNOW because she didn't know her body! People who KNOW their body will never pass it along! So, cut her a break, if she was real inexperienced or uptight about her private parts, she most likely didn't know! THATS exactly how it gets passed along. Educate yourself and your friends, you'll be doing the world of good sex. Big favor!!!

Thank you in advance.\n\nI am a man who is considering dating and potentially having sex with a woman who has cerebral palsy and HSV-1/Cold Sore.\n\nSome backstory on my potential partner:\n\nAs I understand it, I believe it is not her fault and she was born that way. Basically when her mother was pregnant with her and was really sick, her mother had a cold sore and as a result, her mother was forced to give birth to her very prematurely. In the process, she apparently contracted HSV-1 from her mother at birth because of the cold sore. So she had some sort of neonatal herpes.\n\nSo with what in mind, what I want to know is this:\n\nIf I have VAGINAL intercourse/sex with her, is it possible for me to get HSV-1 even though she does not have genital herpes and only has HSV-1/Cold Sore? She does not have sex during a breakout, which is rare for her and as far as I know. She takes medicine for herpes, but I am not sure which kind as I did not ask.\n\nBefore you answer, please read and consider this in order to give me a very accurate answer:\n\nWe will NOT be having any oral sex of any kind. Strictly vaginal. She does not have genital herpes. So there will be no spread from her mouth to my penis. But even though she does not have herpes in or near her genitals, is there still a chance I can contract HSV-1 from her?\n\nI am aware of safe sex practices, but I would like to have vaginal sex without a condom if at all possible. Is this possible?\n\nI have researched and googled HSV-1/herpes, but no material at all covers whether or not you can safely have vaginal sex if a woman only has HSV-1/cold sore and when there will be no oral sex at all.\n\nThank you for any answers.","like_count":"0","tags":["Women's Issues","Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Concerns about a potential partner with HSV-1/Herpes \"Tide\".","resp_content":"Hi I think this link gives some good advice with contact links and phone numbers.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/stdfact-herpes.htm\n\nI think its most dodgy when she has break outs, something to read up about.\n\nIf you have a local sexual health/GUM Clinic try going there as its there field of work and see if you can sit down with one of there doctors for even more advice, nothing like a face to face.

I was sexually abused as a child/adolescent by the person who was my pediatrician as well as other individuals. *Warning: semi graphic information ahead*\n\nMy sophomore year in high school, I had symptoms which when you look at the whole constellation of them could lead you to believe I was pregnant. Because of who one of my abusers was it was not uncommon for things to happen to me that very well could have resulted in a termination of a pregnancy without my being involved or knowing.\n\nOnly one memory exists which might have some bearing on that. I would have been only 15 and immature for my age so understand that I am only able to describe this through a child's perception. I was held down or restrained in some way. It was in his \"office\" which was in a private house and I never knew nurse's worked in places other than the school until I was way older than a normal kid because he didn't have one. My legs were being held spread wide open and I remember my hips hurt. He had a whole bunch of what I remember as metal sticks of all different sizes on a towel. He kept sticking them in me and there was terrible pain and my stomach hurt. I vomited at one point because it hurt so much and I was crying so hard. I don't remember much after that because I think I either passed out or dissociated. This would have been 1987.\n\nI do not know what this episode was. If it was just more of the sadistic abuse which had in the past involved foreign objects. It is the most painful physically episode I remember. It is one of the last times he touched me. I escaped to college in just 2 years, early.\n\nBut, I do not want to allow a false memory to be given to me just because something seems like it might be. So, my question is . . . Can my obgyn somehow during my exam tell if I was pregnant in the past? If not, do you think if I were to describe all my symptoms from back then to her along with the episode I desciped here - could I trust her opinion on what happened?\n\nI need to resolve this and I can't take the suspicion of a therapist with no medical knowledge. To be able to let it go or to face it, I need to hear the opinion from someone with better background to make that call.

I never got an explanation of these numbers as that doctor was too incompetent to follow up or respond to inquiries.\nThe next physician looked at the same test and decided I needed a swab test. According to new doc, the blood test for HSV was not always reliable in its predictions and a physical swab was the best indicator. The swab came back negative for HSV 1&2.

It lasted for like 2 minutes. I also shaved my penis and balls right before the encounter. He said he was STD free and I didn't see any signs of him having STDs. It was the dumbest thing i've ever done. That's my only sexual encounter of my whole life.\nAs soon as i got home from this encounter I rubbed a waterless antiseptic foam on my penis and balls pretty roughly. This antiseptic contains 62% ethyl alcohol by the way. After doing that I scrubbed my penis and balls somewhat roughly with a bar of soap and water. I didn't take a shower and didn't wash away the soap as best as i could, but i rinsed the area with water until there was barely any soap visible, then i headed to sleep.\nThere hasn't been any pain when i pee, However, I did ejaculate once and it was slightly painful. And after that ejaculation, which was a couple hours ago, I've been feeling a weird sensation in my urethra. After the ejaculation my pee does feel very slightly stingy, but barely anything from normal. If I don't think about it, I can make the pain mostly go away. My testicles do not hurt at all and are not swollen. I don't have any puss coming out of my penis and i don't have any sores/blisters/warts. But, I am an incredibly paranoid and anxious person, so I've been freaking out that I have herpes or some STD. I'm going to wait two weeks from the day I had the encounter to get tested. But in the meantime I am so insanely paranoid that I have been using hand sanitizer obsessively after touching anything that's been near my junk, including clothes and towels, etc. The irritation is tolerable, however the anxiety is bad. I looked up the effects of antiseptic on penises and it said it could cause penis irritation or even Chemical urethritis. I know the very slight irritation can be because of the antiseptic or an STD, so i will have to wait to be tested first. My question is do I have to wash my hands after touching my penis every single time? I;m worried if i don't i could spread HPV or and STD to other areas of my body or to my family.

Bad circumcision?","post_content":"Hello all,\n\nI'm a 47 yr old male. I've had big problems with sex from my earliest experiences with it. I recently read a description of the possible bad side effects of circumcision and they mirrored my experience very well.\n\n- I get erections very easily.\n- The sensation of rubbing the shaft feels very good, but doesn't really stimulate the build up to orgasm.\n- The head and the frenulum can feel good, but often begin to get painful or numb quickly.\n- The ridge behind the head of the penis is very sensitive and rubbing it is how I get to orgasm (if I can.) But there are points on my penis that get very painful from this stimulation even if I use a lot of lube and rub very gently.\n- There is a strange \"inversion\" feeling that happens often. I'll get closer and closer to orgasm and it inverts. It goes away. The build up kind of shoots into my gonads or gut without release and feels really uncomfortable. The penis is really sensitive at this point and usually painful. If I carefully rub the areas that don't hurt too much I can usually get to orgasm. But sometimes this 'inversion' will happen 2, 3, or 4 times. The effect is to really, really want to have an orgasm, but more and more discomfort, pain, and acidlike burning to get there.\n- Orgasms don't feel good. They are painful, they often burn or I feel nothing at all. Many times I could not tell if I had and orgasm or not.\n- It often takes a long time to get to orgasm. In my younger days I'd masturbate for hours sometimes, just trying to get to the release.\n- If I compare the sensitivity of the anus to the sensitivity of the head of my penis, I'd say the penis has about 20% of the sensitivity.\n- The biggest problem I have is, the more aroused I get, the harder it seems to have an orgasm and the worse it feels. So, being really attracted to someone has the effect of essentially giving me really bad blue balls. To be honest, the lack of enjoyment has left me feeling like I've had blue balls for 35 years. I've gone as long as 12 years between sexual partners, because of the confusion this has caused. It's not that I don't want to have sex. I do, the drive is there. Spring time is here and I'll be seeing women out on the street in less clothing. I have desire, but the sex is so uncomfortable and I get no satisfaction out of it, that most of the time it's better to pretend sex doesn't exist rather than feel the discomfort. I've had few partners. And the ones I've had get discouraged because I never come. Like 7 month relationships without an orgasm. Certainly brings up questions of \"Are you really attracted to me?\", for both of us.\n\nThanks","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"nohard","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Hard to reach orgasm and there's no pleasure in it.

So I've been in a relationship for over 9 with the same women we have kids blah blah blah my problem is first I'm very sexual and she not now it used to be different we've both done our fair share of hurting and lying. We've had an open relationship and it was ok. I've had a lot of sex obviously so it's gotten to the point now instead of a few times a day then it went once a day now I'm lucky if it's every 4 days. Unfortunately for me i was not blessed with a huge package but it's not tiny either. So I've noticed that when we don't have sex for a few days she is normally tighter and sometimes she is not. I know all the muscle and medical blah I'm saying that this is bad for me I'm sure due to one guy she messd with when she got home I could tell immediately that dude was hung like a bull. So I know for a fact in my own experience that if someone bigger than me has been her it's different so that being said I'm pretty sure of even 2 days of not having sex she should be tighter and always has been so we have our open relationship and she should not be going behind my back. She says she's not but damn I gotta beg her to get laid Is he don't kiss me anymore don't look at me when we do have sex always has her eyes closed sometimes is even on her phone. I as and I get told I'm crazy and paranoid she's always on her damn phone has Instagram facebook and Snapchat with all kinds of dudes. She tells me it's because were busy and a bunch of what I consider b.s. I understand our busy lives but I'm always trying to give her love and affection I always make time I love her a lot and want believe she's not but what am I supposed to think? I know this long and if your still reading this thanks. I don't go through her phone because all but facebook don't store messages no point evidence gone. I did recently and noticed she has had a secret Yahoo email. Also she used to text me a lot and now I barely get anything she is super busy but I can't even get a simple ily text back.

Ive been 6'5\" since 7th or 8th grade and presently could weigh from 220 to 230 lbs any given week. As a teen I was athletic and into my early 20's I stayed active. Basketball kid, I didnt hit 200 lbs till around 23ish. And im saying this because to me all of it would almost certainly mean there was no stunting of my growth. Around the age of 5 or so, i suffered an injury that THANKFULLY i have no actual memory of, just the story told to me by family members and the scar to collaborate it. I was standing on the toilet, leaning towards the sink, trying to see myself in the mirror, as i brushed my teeth. No one saw how or why i slipped or fell off the toilet, but with one screem my dad said he knew he was running towards something bad. And as he ran into the bathroom he could see me suspended, upside down, off the floor, between the toilet and sink with blood and tears streaming down my belly, to my face and then the floor. I had caught myself on the toilet paper rack (a metal hook in those days apparently) by my torn open testicles. And to this day let him tell the story, we arrived at the e.r. and he had me in one arm, and my, \"balls in his other hand.\" Litteraly. He swares he'll never forget they were the most beautiful shade of dark blue hes still ever seen. Ive got the scar, and matching stories from dozens of family members so i know it happened. But ive always wondered if dad may have been a little bit scared and understandably, a little hollywood about my testicles actually being completely severed and at least for a few hours not attached to me. If he wasnt exaggerating then it means a surgeon in phx, az around 1985 was able to reattach my jewels (cuz they are in their) and since ive got a beautiful 9 year old daughter, reattach them 'right.' i cant imagine thatd be a common fix, right? Or is it? And lastly what if any effect would/could such an injury have on the full development of my testicles and penis? Because, though ive never had any confidence issues, its not exactley all proportional with the rest of my body. And the scar size in the shape of an L or a 7, depending on POV, was definitely a pull it tight and hope it holds job. My scrodem seldom hangs, and 90% of the time is really tightly snug with my body like when its cold, or accidently caught it while zipping up ur pants too fast, if you know what i mean?

Here's the story:\n\nI recently went to the doctor to see about a pain above my right buttock. I got tested and confirmed a diagnosis of a UTI (which is unrelated, but I didn't know I had it), and Ankylosing Spondylitis. The UTI might be caused by my phimosis, but it doesn't happen often.\n\nAnyways, he gave me pills for the UTI that I had to take for a week. In this time period, I stopped masturbating for about 5 days because I didn't want to interfere with the healing process or whatever.\n\nWhen I did it again, I had this very uncomfortable feeling. You know when you ejeculate and you experience contractions in your penis that feel amazing? Well, it was like that, but I felt little to no pleasure at all. The contractions felt like I was constantly trying to push something out of the penis, like the semen was trying to rocket out too hard and the pressure was too great to enjoy it. It really killed the feeling for me and now I'm worried. It happened consistently for a while and now I just quit masturbating until I find out the issue.\n\nWhat's going on? Why did this suddenly start happening? Is it because I spend a lot of time sitting down? Do I need to consistently masturbate for a while until the pressure dies down? Was it there for a while and the UTI was just desensitizing it for me? It feels really weird and not like it used to.\n\nI really can't see the doctor about this because unfortunately my parents are very religious and don't condone masturbating of any sort. I'd face a fate worse than what I have with my penis if they found out.\n\nThank you.","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Very uncomfortable feeling when ejeculating?","resp_content":"Sorry, I forgot to mention that there is no possibility of an obscure STD.

One of the side effects of this medication was that it would always cause my penis and scrotum to retract as if they were extremely cold all the time throughout the day - causing me to have to take hot or warm baths to temporarily solve this. It actually made it quite uncomfortable, and the surface temperature of the skin on my penis and testicles was quite cool as if not enough blood flow was getting to them. Stopping the meds has obviously solved this.\n\nFrom time to time I get a tingling feeling in my scrotum, and my testicles quickly retract for a while, and only seem to go back to their \"loose\" formation when I'm very warm such as when in the Sauna or a hot bath. They then go back to normal.\n\nMy sex drive has not been affected as of yet and I can still have sex perfectly fine. I'm not so worried now about fertility since my fiance is now pregnant with our first child, but the size of things down there is really starting to bug me.\n\nI have also gone to the extent of purchasing an Orchidometer, which doctors use to determine the size of testicles, and my right one does measure almost exactly the top size, which is 25ml and according to this, this is the normal size for an adult testicle, but things still feel a lot lighter and smaller than they used to be.\n\nMy issue is that things used to be larger than they are, and there seems to be no evidence of any issue which could have caused the right side to get smaller, and yet I notice it quite a lot and notice that its not only smaller, but also a lot lighter than it used to be.\n\nI've discussed the use of Clomiphene to my Urologists, which is a hormone used in women mainly, but can reverse testicular atrophy, but none of the 4 Urologists seem to think this is necessary.\n\nSo far I've had several ultrasounds by several different Urologists, physical examinations, blood flow scans and also had blood tests to see if I have the right amount of testosterone and growth hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone etc... - all of which show normal results.\n\nWhat on earth could this be? What can I do to reverse the atrophy (if anything) and what on earth could be causing it?\n\nThanks in advance!","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/7208/unexplained-testicular-atrophy-at-23"},{"post":{"author":"daddyphantom","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Does this appear to be genital herpes?","post_content":"I'm 17 and I recently received oral sex from two men in their 50's, about a week later I started getting these red bumps underneath the head of my penis, and on the inside of my foreskin where it folds over the bumps on my head.

I'm fairly new to the area and I don't have a Primary Care Physician so when I thought I needed the STD panel I went to a walk-in clinic. When the results came back positive I told my wife, who is (and was at the time of the affair) pregnant, to get tested and she told her boyfriend. She went to her OB/GYN to get the test and I know nothing about his but both of them came back negative. I have only had the one partner in the past 20 years so how I have syphilis and neither her nor her partner tested positive is bothering me.\n\nMy first question is do I actually have it? I received the results over the phone and was told to come in the next day for treatment. When the doctor came in the room she said my panel was all clear. I told her I was told I had syphilis the night before and she glanced at the chart and said \"oh yeah, you do\". She then had the admins come in to take my credit card so they could administer the two penicillin shots. The results paperwork they gave me shows Reactive for both the RPR and FTA-ABS tests with a 1:2 for my RPR Titer. Am I the victim of a Walk-in clinic scam?\n\nI've searched the internet for RPR Titers and found my score should fall after treatment. I also read that it fluctuates up or down a level, which is normal, but given my RPR titer is about as low as it can go, a single fluctuation would show my levels increasing and the treatment is not working. If I do have syphilis, how will I know the treatment is working?\n\nWith my low RPR Titer, is it possible this is a sign of something else? I read about Lupis showing as a false positive but only in pregnant women. I also read about a couple skin diseases from South America and Africa. I was in both places for the military but not for the past 10 years. I've had a number of doctors since leaving the military 10 years ago but I'm not sure if I ever got an STD test during any of those visits.

Wasn't raised, didn't itch, didn't crust, went 95% away within a week. I had prostate/penis pain about the same time, took 1000 mg of leftover azithromycin to try and kill anything I might have. I took a urine test at 3 weeks post exposure and had blood in urine, high blood pressure, but no infections were present. A week later (4 weeks post exposure) on retest blood was gone, was diagnosed as urethritis and told to flush with fluids. Has been fine for the last 7 weeks plus. The circular discoloration came back about a month later (9 weeks post exposure) and a nurse practioner and MD said it was tinea cruris and prescribed lamasil. The lamisil got rid of 95% of it and it can't really be seen unless you know where to look and look very closely. Still shows under a black light but was told that may be there for a while. Today, 11 weeks and 3 days after my only exposure, on my lower inner groin on the opposite leg (left) have a few small red bumps. They don't itch or hurt, but they are raised. There's some hair there. It appears under a black light I may have similar bumps on my other leg in the same spot, but that area doesn't seem as red or bumpy. Is there any way I could be having an initial herpes outbreak 11+ weeks after exposure? I feel fine for the most part, and have never had any type of herpes outbreak, cold sore, or anything.\n\nAlso, I took an HIV test 6.5 weeks after exposure and was negative. I've had very, very mild throat tenderness (I hesitate to call it sore) the last 5 weeks. Is there any way I have HIV and should I test again?\n\nManic here, please help.

I pray it hasn't been compounded.","like_count":"0","tags":["Men's Issues","Genital Herpes"]},"responses":[{"author":"georgiagail","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Herpes 11+ weeks after exposure?

Thus, many urologists and STD doctors are unable to identify chlamydia and mycoplasma as a causative pathogen. As a result, they often make general diagnosis, such as, non-specific urethritis, prostatitis, and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), etc. And, they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patient condition more complicated; weakening the immune system, causing antibiotic resistance, failing to address causative pathogens, and allowing the infection to spread, etc.\n\nHope this is the answer.

I figured I had a UTI so went down to CVS and got a testing kit and tested positive for leukocytes. I then went to my university health center to get a prescription for antibiotics but while I was there I gave a urine sample that was sent to a lab and basically forced into taking a medicine for chlamydia. I was able to get a hold of the antibiotics on the same Friday that I went to the health center and I was able to complete the dosage by Monday morning. However, I got an email from the health center later on Monday and they said that I had tested positive for gonorrhea. My boyfriend said he would go in to get tested but unfortunately was not able to make it because of spring break. However, I recently had to go in for a ridiculously high fever, which turned out to be the flu, but while I was there the doctor who saw me that time discussed my case with the doctor I saw for the UTI and she then told me that she doesn't believe I have the flu, she thinks I have HIV. She wanted to draw blood but I said no I'll go to a free clinic that's in the area. The doctor was about to exit the room when she told me that they were going to give me the shot for gonorrhea right then. I told her that all the symptoms of my UTI were gone so I think the test just went wrong and I never had gonorrhea to begin with. She then said, \"You never had a UTI, your urine sample was cultured and cured (or something like that)\". This made me very angry because if they knew from the beginning that I didn't have a UTI why was I given a prescription for the antibiotics and why was I not told up front that I don't have a UTI?

So they didn't know that you didn't have a UTI at the time and they were probably simply treating you as if you had in case you didn't go back .\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe you have gonorrhea because they tested you positive. The test for gonorrhea looks for a specific type of bacteria, neisseria gonorrhoeae, so false positives are extremely rare (mixing up samples, for instance) - if it's not there, they can't find it and can't say you tested positive.

Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood, and infection is lifelong. The vast majority of HSV-1 infections are oral herpes (infections in or around the mouth, sometimes called orolabial, oral-labial or oral-facial herpes), but a proportion of HSV-1 infections are genital herpes (infections in the genital or anal area).\n\nScope of the problem\n\nIn 2012, an estimated 3.7 billion people under the age of 50, or 67% of the population, had HSV-1 infection. Estimated prevalence of the infection was highest in Africa (87%) and lowest in the Americas (40-50%).\n\nWith respect to genital HSV-1 infection, 140 million people aged 15-49-years were estimated to have genital HSV-1 infection worldwide in 2012, but prevalence varied substantially by region. Most genital HSV-1 infections are estimated to occur in the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific, where HSV-1 continues to be acquired well into adulthood. In other regions, for example in Africa, most HSV-1 infections are acquired in childhood, before the age of sexual debut.\n\nSo your GF may already be carrying it and she would never know like a lot of us, as its that common.

Nothing to worry about there :)\n\nThe only advice I can give is to make sure you use condoms for the first 7 days of taking the pill after your period week is up.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/4984/does-this-count-as-missing-1-or-2-pills"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Orgasms","post_content":"When orgasm occurs i get an excrutiating headache during and 3-5 minutes afterward.

I am 25 and have been having this problem since Feb 2016. I was in a serious relationship that ended in September of 2014, which really destroyed me and tried some dating for the next year which never worked out and I haven't really been dating in over a year. I have never had difficulty with erections, in fact quite the opposite. My whole life I would just get them all the time and my biggest problem was trying to hide them. When I stopped dating, I was masturbating a lot more, like a couple times a day and then all of a sudden things weren't working the way they should. I can still get an erection but it is very difficult and usually not as hard as it used to be, usually requires a fair amount of physical stimulation or pornography to really get things going and sometimes not even then. I went to see my GP last summer, who basically said I wasn't eating enough salad and referred me to a urologist. I saw the urologist who basically decided in 5 seconds it was all in my head and pretty much just walked out. Since then, there was a 5 day period where things got much better (I'm not sure why) where I felt like things were almost back to normal again except they got gradually worse until I was back to where I was at the end of the 5 days. I do have a busy lifestyle but I don't think I'm all that stressed. I have also had issues with frequent urination and not completely emptying during urination. In general my penis feels a lot smaller and more compact and even colder than it used to. Could this all somehow be in my head? I had a blood test which showed very slightly low blood pressure and very slightly elevated cholesterol but the urologist said that was nothing. I did not have an STD panel but it has been a long time since I've had intercourse and it's at the point where I'm afraid to get intimate again because I feel like I probably will have difficulty preforming. Testosterone level was above average. I very rarely wake up with morning wood anymore and don't get all the erections during the day that I used to anymore. This is causing a lot of depression and self esteem issues for me which is probably feeding back into the problem. Does anyone have an idea what is wrong?

I just Fing want someone to take me seriously. I have even emailed a couple of researchers who have written articles on the female orgasm, specifically in regards to the multi-orgasm phenomenon.\n\nI'm the boyfriend of a 36 year old woman who although can experience a single orgasm through clitoral self-stimulation, she experiences over 100 orgasms during vaginal intercourse alone within a 15 minute period. Which she calls a \"rolling orgasm\".\n\nThis rolling orgasm is described by her being a multi-orgasm where she has an orgasm quickly followed by more orgasms that start seconds apart, but quickly become more frequent, in shorter intervals, in a quick sequence over and over again. She claims to have as many as 150 within a 15 min period of vaginal intercourse.\n\nNow, although I am not a doctor by any means. I have however read articles regarding Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. What separates what she experiences during vaginal intercourse from PGAD is the fact that she is motivated by her own sexual expression and pleasure which does not stem from a genital \"itch\" or \"throb\", but rather from her desire that is voluntary and under her control.\n\nAlthough, she does admit that she constantly preoccupies her thoughts and imagination with the thought of vaginal intercourse and has a hard time thinking about anything else due to a self-described \"addiction\" to this multi-orgasm phenomenon brought on by vaginal coitus.\n\nLook, I have researched all over the place trying to look for answers for what she is experiencing besides the idea of just going to therapy for sex addiction. Even the definition of a female sex addict doesn't seem to describe her due to the research I've read stating that sex addiction isn't really a need for the pleasure of the orgasms.\n\nI just want to know what the F is going on. Not that I'm too worried about her, but she does seem to have a little difficulty staying on task at work and needs a release, refusing self clitoral stimulation because \"it's not the same thing, not as strong, and not the same feeling.\"\n\nPersonally, I think she should be studied and could possibly help a lot of people, but I don't think anyone believes me.

Me and my GF are in highschool I am fifteen she is sixteen, last time she was checked for STDs was February 2016 a month before we started dating (which means we would be dating for a year next month so woohoo) and everything csme back negative including HSV-1. I have gotten cold sores dating all the way back since elementary school but last year after spring break I got hit HARD with cold sores like one every two or three weeks but It has died down very heavily since then. three days ago before I noticed we were making out and she touched the spot that the cold sore was forming and because... ahem... moist she ended up putting her hands on her genitalia to hide it, now normally I wouldn't be too worried but as a very rare and unlucky occurance she not only wore a skirt and lace panties that were too small (pretty sure only in th back though) and she pushed it down and her hands again were right against her genitalia. Now if this matters again going back to my bad time last year with cold sores she had no qualms about kissing me when i had a obvious cold sore and even once or twice while it was oozing (becuase lets be honest no matter how okay you are with it that is disgusting) so she likely already got it from me before June or whenever summer break starts but as far as I know she has never had out breaks and has never touched my cold sore then immediatly touched her genitals/ directly touched herself (she always wears jeans and from what I read it wouldn't pass through those) although now that I think about it she might've but if I get an answer for the first question i'll likely get this one answered as well but if you want to answer this one directly as well please do. So back to my more recent question, if she touched a cold sore that wasn't even formed yet and touched her vag? And if it matters I only noticed the tingling/ on and off warm feeling after wards and I put abreva on twice when I got home that day and the warm feverish feeling was on and off like I said and same with the tingling (i think) and its been doing that for three days now and I put abreva on once yesterday. Another question of a similar stature but this happened this morning, The spot was still deciding whether or not it was going to be a cold sore or not but I did notice some bump on my lip in the area but it has been there for months and the general area was more smooth probably which is why i noticed it (just in case its a bump that looks like blood has clogged it, its probably a scar) and white marks under the skin one meh sized one above the bump and one a little bit more the right. I don't know if they were there is the morning but if they have they really haven't changed at all. But the problem her is I accidently said something that made her wet... like garden hose leaking wet apparently and she touched the spot again and did touch her crouch but I am pretty sure her jeans would have prevented it to pass and if she was basically masturbating (yeah I know... in a public place to...) but a little time passed and she went to class and immediatly asked to use the restroom which was two halls away I should add. But i fear her hand may have had some of her \"stuff\" on it and since its warm an moist would have kept the virus alive on both her hand and possibly her pants and that when she cleaned her self up she could have infected herself and while I am here typing I fear it could have happened when she cleaned herself up on the skirt day. So here is my question in a nutshell: could any of the ways of cold sore (erupted or not) to hand to genitals/ cold sore to moist hand/pants to genitals infect her? If she was already infected by me without any symptoms (I mean she does have two or three white bumps on her lip but theyve been there for months now and have not oozed fluid so if you can tell me what it is please do) would she have devolped anti bodies to HSV-1 by now? or would she have to wait until her first outbreak? Now I am sorry for all the questions and that that is so long and all over the place but I wanted to be descriptive. I belive the person who moniters these questions is Grace and I would like an answer from her since she seems to be very knowledgeable but I am open for anyone who can give answers and reasons for that answer.

OK\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nOral herpes infection is mostly asymptomatic, and the majority of people with HSV-1 infection are unaware they are infected. Symptoms of oral herpes include painful blisters or open sores called ulcers in or around the mouth. Sores on the lips are commonly referred to as “cold sores.” Infected persons will often experience a tingling, itching or burning sensation around their mouth, before the appearance of sores. After initial infection, the blisters or ulcers can periodically recur. The frequency of recurrences varies from person to person.\n\nGenital herpes caused by HSV-1 can be asymptomatic or can have mild symptoms that go unrecognized. When symptoms do occur, genital herpes is characterised by 1 or more genital or anal blisters or ulcers. After an initial genital herpes episode, which may be severe, symptoms may recur, but genital herpes caused by HSV-1 often does not recur frequently.\n\nTransmission\n\nHSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes infection, via contact with the HSV-1 virus in sores, saliva, and surfaces in or around the mouth. However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.\n\nHSV-1 can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal and when there are no symptoms present. However, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores.\n\nIndividuals who already have HSV-1 oral herpes infection are unlikely to be subsequently infected with HSV-1 in the genital area.\n\nIn rare circumstances, HSV-1 infection can be transmitted from a mother with genital HSV-1 infection to her infant during delivery.\n\nNOWHARD\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/4479/is-a-cold-sore-contagious-before-it-erupts-tingling-warm-stage-indirectly-spread-to-gf"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Question about STDs","post_content":"A 27 year old woman had unprotected sex with her boyfriend 8 years ago.

I am a 23 year old male who just recently lost his virginity and is currently in a relationship. However I had received oral sex about 1 year ago.\n\nI noticed a few days ago some bumps on my foreskin. They are small and reddish white and there are about 6 of them. Not really clustered up in any way though.\n\nThere is no irritation except for a minor itch that comes and goes.\n\nHowever when looking up information about it I have come to realize that my foreskin is supposed to retract behind the head of my penis. I had never known that or done it. During sex it never retracted though i felt some pain when it was pulled back. I thought that was abnormal and so i stopped it.\n\nI was a bit worried about possible STD from the 1 year ago encounter but this has only popped up after losing my virginity and I have had an STD test about a month ago and everything was clear. I believe she is clear as she has only had one partner before me.\n\nLast night I pulled back my foreskin (painfully) for the first time in my life and didn't notice any abnormalities on the head of my penis. It then got stuck but I was eventually able to pull it back over.\n\nId like to add that growing up i did have pimples sometimes on my penis and some irritation from time to time. Having been a virgin and never knowing about retracting my penis I assumed it was normal. But it was never 6 different ones at once. Usally 1 maybe 2.\n\nSo with all of that said I was wondering:\n\n1. If anyone had any idea what the small bumps are. I am worried they might be HPV genital warts but I think it could also be balanitis. I do not think they are herpes.\n\n2. Could I have gotten genital warts from receiving Oral Sex. I highly doubt it would have come from my partner but nothing popped up until this week?\n\n3. What do I do about retracting my foreskin.

I've been with the same man for the last six years currently, and the last I was with for seven.\n\nI have had two yeast infections, both while pregnant (2006 and 2008). While I was pregnant with my daughter (2006) my obgyn told me I had bacterial vaginosis.\n\nBy the next time I had a pap smear just before I got pregnant with my son (2008) it came back normal.\n\nBecause I was young and naive I didn't make annual pap smear appointments, my next one wasn't until about 2012-2013. That pap resulted in an abnormal cell count. This was at my local health department. Afterwards, I was advised to schedule an appointment for a colposcopy with a specialist. Well, much to my regret now, I didn't do anything about it. I barely make over minimum wage, have never had health insurance (other than Medicaid while I was pregnant with my children), I just naively chose to disregard it.\n\nMuch to my amazement, the next time I went in for a pap, at the same health department (2014-2015), my results came back as normal, or as far as I know, they did, because I wasn't contacted or talked to about it afterwards. (I went there regularly for birth control)\n\n2014-2015 was the last time I had an exam.\nA couple of months ago, and still today, I started experiencing a lot of itching down there. It's driving me crazy. I am also experiencing very light bleeding, but I do not know if the bleeding is from scratching so much or from something else. Sex isn't painful, but if I've been scratching recently, my urine will burn like hell. Most of the time it doesn't burn though. My discharge has mostly been clear and watery. To me it smells a bit off, but not necessarily foul.\nI thought it may have been a yeast infection at first, I went about two weeks ago and bought an over the counter one day treatment and it hasn't eased any symptoms, so I have checked that possibility off the list.\nI was feeling around a couple of days ago, and then I felt a small, rock hard like ball or lump at the top of my clitoris.

There's a swollen ball looking thing where the cut starts at (still right at the opening of my vagina. If I'm laying on my back, it'd be at the top.) and (this is weird I know) it looks like it has little tentacles coming off of it. The pain is almost unbearable. I have no sex drive really. When we have sex, the initial penetration hurts so bad I could cry (the little ball looking thing is what hurts so bad. Then I get the cut.) But then after a minute it stops hurting. Then it hurts again after we get done until like the next day. Now, I got pregnant this time last year with our twin baby girls. And the entire time I was pregnant I had no issues. No pain, no cuts, nothing. But when we got the okay to have sex again after they were born it started back. They're almost 5 months old now. And it's worse now than it was before I got pregnant. I don't have health insurance so if I go see a doctor I NEED a diagnosis bc I'll be paying *** loads of money. But I figured I'd give this a shot first. I also have vaginal dryness. And when he fingers me, or we use toys, it doesn't hurts. Idk if his penis is just too big () but I need some relief. I want to enjoy sex again :( someone please help.

A few days ago, I strained a lot when having a bowel movement and at that moment felt a dull pain around the vagina/uterus area. The next day, after walking, I started bleeding vaginally. It was mostly brown, a bit of red; later during the day I had a cramp-like pain in the lower stomach and in the back (which usually happens when I have a \"period\"). It lightened throughout the day, but stayed. The next day, same thing, light at home, brown and red after walking, then very wet and a pinkish/red, stayed and lightened throughout the day; had an easy bowel movement in the evening. Yesterday I woke up and thought the bleeding was pretty much done (vaginal mucous still not clear). Had a bowel movement in the morning, still just lightly colored mucous. About 2 hours later, the bleeding started again, this time completely red and very wet. I thought it might be the start of a \"period\" or breakthrough bleeding because I took my birth control half an hour late a few days earlier.\nI checked my cervix last night, it was semi-hard (like it usually is on birth control), but also felt a bit thin, and was open with a lot of mucous at the opening (lightly brown). This morning, mucous still a bit discolored; checked cervix again and it felt a bit dryer and more rounded and closed. Lightly discolored mucous in morning, but I thought it was fine and that it must just have been breakthrough bleeding. Then I had a bowel movement (no straining), and right away I was bleeding; very red, very wet and slippery. It kept up throughout the day, and is only now starting to lighten.

I know it's possible to develop a prolapsed pelvic floor if you strain the area too much, but I thought this was over time; could it have happened after just one time?

In the baby care room, a lady who saw me struggling to wake up the baby to breastfeed helped me. She said she had four kids and seemed quite experienced and helpful. Exhausted and sleep-deprived, I did not react. She held the baby and told me I should remove some of her clothing to help wake her up, and she removed her pants, she saw her diaper said that it was not put on properly, she opened and readjusted the diaper before I could stop her. She then showed me how to swaddle. At that moment I looked up at her face and saw that she had a cold sore. I was shocked. I told her. She said she had washed her hands as she had also breastfeed her own child. But I cannot stop obsessing since that day.\nSorry that it has been a long story, but I am extremely worried that my baby may have caught genital HSV1 from that woman. What if she touched her cold sore without me or her realizing and then her face or worse-her genital area while adjusting the diaper? I have read that it is possible to give a baby genital HSV1 from a cold sore during a diaper change. I also read that the droplets in saliva could also cause transmission. I have had cold sores before so I think I may have passed some oral HSV1 antibodies to my baby, but I don't know if this would protect her against genital HSV1. So far, she hasn't shown any symptoms, but I read that there may be no symptoms for years.\n\nI suffer from OCD and am extremely worried. I cannot enjoy my days with my beautiful days due to this uncertainty. What if my baby has caught a lifetime genital STD because of my momentary lapse of judgment. I cannot live with the guilt and the unknown.\n\nTo sum up, is it possible for a baby to catch HSV1 orally or genitally in the way I desribed.

The virus is spread through prolonged contact with the open wound or through the infected saliva of someone with an active wound. This is how it is passed orally to orally, orally to genital, genital to orally, or genital to genital. If your baby had been infected she would have had an initial outbreak of the virus and then it could lay dormant in her system until the next flare up. The HSV1 virus can easily be passed through the use of shared utensils, food, or drink by a person with an outbreak, and also through kissing, so something to be cautious about. If you are really worried about it you can have a blood test done on her to confirm if she has the virus within her blood stream, although I do not think this is necessary.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/1747/genital-hsv1-in-newborn"},{"post":{"author":"tjdavid21444","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Trouble reaching orgasm","post_content":"Lately I have noticed that it takes me a lot longer to reach orgasm than it used to.

I'm a 21 year old male, I was recently tested positive for clhamydia. Now I've never gotten an STD before. Before I knew this, here's how it started. For about a few weeks, I started to develop this small burning sensation when I peed. Another thing I noticed was the tip of my penis, whenever touched like by my clothes (inside my pants) or even a slight touch of my finger it would hurt. So I figured it would go away but it didn't. So on December 22 I went to my local urgent care and they did the urine test. Come Christmas Eve they told me I was positive for clhamydia. I was prescribed 2 pills 500 Mg of azithromycin one dosage to take at once. They said it would take about a week for symptoms to go away. It's odd though because I've been drinking a lot of water and it soothes the burning, but once in awhile it will still burn. Also the touching of the tip still happens. Now it's been a week and I still have both of these symptoms. I called the nurse from the urgent care and just told me to call to come in again during the week. Now my question is, when will these symptoms go away? I still have the burning and weird touching feeling still. Is possible I have something else and not clhamydia? What should I do? Just can't really call or go in due to the holidays. I've never had this before and just want the symptoms to go away.

Bleeding, tightness, pain are not the only indicators of virginity so for you to assume that you are in the clear of an STD because the girls were \"virgins\" is no offense, ignorant, and if you are sexually active, you should be getting tested reguarly. (2) intercourse is not the only way to contract an STD. Any time sexual fluid or blood comes into contact with another person, regardless of penis-to-vagina penetration, there is a risk of STD transmission. So regardless of their virginity, they could have still passed it on to you.\n\nIt’s important to keep the penis pimple and the surrounding area clean and dry, but avoid scrubbing or using harsh cleansers that can cause irritation.

I really notice it when sitting in certain positions or sometimes when I am moving around. The pain is localized mostly at the top of the right testicle, slightly posterior and slightly to the right. Upon self-examination, I noticed that no swelling was present in my testicle or epididymis, but I did find it to be tender and painful in what felt like the tube connecting to the right testicle at the top. The pain is more prevalent on some days as compared to others, so sometimes it feels normal and other times it feels more tender and slightly more painful.

He took a urine sample, which I have not yet been contacted about in terms of results, and it has been a week already.

Shortly afterward, I developed a sore throat, a white coating on my tongue, halitosis, and these spots at the back of my throat. It's hard to see in the pictures, but there are also white streaks there too. Those folds of tissue on both side are also pink and inflamed, as can be seen pretty clearly in the first picture. I've also experienced lethargy, weakness throughout my body, and abdominal pain.\n\nIn the last two months have had two sets of STD panel tests -- urine for Chlamydia/Gonorrhea, blood for HIV and Syphilis -- which all came back negative. However, my clinic and doctor both said they do not do throat swabs, which from what I understand are needed for oral infections, as they can not necessarily be detected through urine tests.\n\nThe nurse would not provide the antibiotics just in case, and dismissed the spots as post nasal drip. From everything I can find on post nasal drip, it does not seem to cause such spots, which I know for a fact were not there before. They haven't really changed over that 3 month period.\n\nMy partner claims she's clean, but she would've only had the same tests as I did.

Outbreaks have always been very minor, I have never had a full blown eruption followed by scabs and such. They have always been around the same spot on the meaty portion of my lower lip, and i have never had more than 1 or 2 per year.\n\nAbout 2 or 3 months ago, I had a small outbreak along the edge of my lip, two small blisters, about 1/4\" apart. They healed quickly, but since then, I have had recurring redness and slight inflammation at one of those blister spots. It looks similar to a new blister forming, but it is not really the same. It's not like an actual blister, just more like a single small puffy spot. If I stretch my lip tight, it disappears, unlike a cold sore blister. I cant feel it with my tongue, which is usually the tell tale sign for me. There is no warning, heat, tingle, burn, pain, or any other warning or symptom. I dont feel under the weather at all like I normally do when a cold sore is coming. It doesnt grow, and nothing comes of it. It usually goes down after a few days, and as the skin grows out, there is never any sign as if there may have been a lesion under the skin.\n\nI was extremely stressed out out when this was happening because we have a newborn at home, and I have been so paranoid to infect my wife, who could in turn infect our daughter. I thought I was having some sort or relapse or recurring sore. But I am starting to think that maybe this is just a side effect of the trauma to the area from the one outbreak a couple of months ago. The redness can even come and go throughout the day, as can the degree of puffiness. Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nI saw a doctor a couple of weeks ago and had him run every test they have from STD's to cancer to see if there was a reason for recurring outbreaks, and other than coming back positive for HSV-1(obviously) and my cholesterol being a little high, everything else is completely fine.

I am healthy, active (exercise about 6 days a week), with a 12% body fat (which is respectable for my age and weight).\n\nSo for the past few months I started noticing the following: my erections are not what they used to be. I hadn't had sex in a few month until I tried to have sex with a girl that I met. The first night we had sex I got a pretty solid erection and we were able to have intercourse for about 10 minutes until I became flaccid. And recently when we tried again, i was rock hard while we were making out but after i took my clothes off the election just faded. She even tried giving me a BJ but still nothing. It is probably the worst feeling a man can have, and the most embarrassing too. I also try not to masturbate, but when I do it's with porn and I should probably avoid it. Even then, my erections when I masturbate are not 100%. I went to the doctor to get a testosterone test and I got a 539, which I looked up and it's not a low level. My erections just do not last, or I just do not get them at all. Sometimes I'll get hard by just looking at my girl and random boners (they're still not 100%) but I wonder why I can't get it up for interrcourse or masturbation.\n\nAdditionally, work and school has been really hectic, leaving me w an average of 4-5hrs of sleep a night which I read that could be an issue, since I am exercising vigorously, working and going to school and my body is not able to recover as it should. Again, I have noticed that my erections have not been where they should for the past 5 months and it is not a new issue. I spoke to my girl about it and she understands, but I'm scared she will leave me.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? What helped you? What can I do to help facilitate this? Is sleeping the real culprit of this situation?

They used to be the worst pain I could've ever imagined, sometimes immobilizing me during really bad attacks. I'd sob and yell and feel so sick, and I can remember the women in the office telling me to \"suck it up\" because I'd be dealing with periods for a long time. At the time, I knew they weren't understanding that I wasn't being a baby. I was in serious distress with unbearable nausea, back-aches, and cramps, and it happened every month like clockwork. I'd been checked for ovarian cysts, but the doctors came up empty handed every time. Every month, I had another week of being told to just deal with it.\n\nNow, I'm twenty, almost twenty-one, and now, I know that this was absolutely not \"normal,\" and I was most certainly not being a baby. For about four years, my periods began to calm down. They became much more irregular, but I no longer had the extreme symptoms I'd had early on. Last year, I had the perfect periods. Still a little unpredictable, but only by a couple days at most, manageable pain levels, and significantly less nausea. And then in December of 2015, I began having extreme abdominal pain in my lower right quadrant. After some tests in the ER, they found I had a large cyst on my right ovary, wrote me a prescription for pain medicine, and told me to make a follow up appointment with a gynecologist soon to get it monitored. I asked about surgery and the Nurse Practitioner I had told me I wasn't a candidate. The next day, I went to the gyno and he told me it was too large to go away on it's own and, in fact, would require immediate surgery. The next day, I was in an operating room, having a panic attack as they put me under.\n\nAfter my periods normalized again, I became extremely irregular again. Now, I'm nearly regular, but dealing with the same extreme pain I used to feel as a young teenager, with the difference being it's always isolated to my ovaries. No cramps, just ovarian pain. I spend nights during this pain curled up crying and days wishing it would just be over. During my last period, I went to the doctor and they'd found a ruptured cyst on my left ovary. They told me to get onto birth control to control the cysts. But I've always been wary of hormonal birth control because of side effects. I've had a lot of issues with mental health and do not want to risk the mood effects and weight gain that typically comes with it.\n\nWith all of this being said, I feel completely alone one week out of every month. I'm afraid my symptoms will get worse and I'll be back in an operating room and wake up with both of my ovaries gone and no chance at conceiving naturally when I want kids in the future. Over the past few months, as the pain and symptoms during my periods got worse, my closest friend was always there, comforting me. Even as a man, he understood that the pain I was feeling was real and awful. The times I cried on his chest, he was nothing but gentle and understanding and would hold me tight and tell me it was okay and he was there, which always came as a surprise considering the flippant attitude I got from other women and healthcare professionals. But now that he's moved back to his hometown, I'm lost. I'm dealing with the awful pain and the emotional hell it brings me to, and I have no one to help me stand when I feel I've fallen.\n\nDoes anyone else experience these things?

It's difficult to know exactly when I contracted it, but my guess is almost two years ago. I had a few instances of mild symptoms consisting of a single itchy lesion which was diagnosed as felicitous on at least 3 different occasions. Finally, the fourth doctor I saw about it said lets do a herpes test just in case... sure enough, the swab test pointed to HSV-2. I was pretty surprised, as every time in the past I had this issue I was given antibiotics and the condition cleared up almost immediately, pointing to a non-viral cause.\n\nAnyway, since my diagnosis I started taking 500mg of valacyclovir once in the morning and once in the evening. I was still experiencing mildish symptoms, so my doctor advised me to take 1500mg/day. Symptoms got a little better, but still there, so I've been taking 1g in the morning and 1g at night (4 500mg pills a day) for about two weeks now. I haven't had any obvious lesions, but I experience tingling/itching throughout the day- sometimes more sometimes less. It's hard to tell if there are lesions present or not- I might think I see a tiny bump at the epicentre of an itchy spot but then I think maybe it's just in my head.\n\nI've done a lot of research about the condition and the way diet can effect it, specifically the relationship between outbreaks and Arginine/Lysine level in the diet. I've been extremely vigilant about trying to eliminate high Arginine food while increasing high Lysine food in my diet, as well as trying to focus on alkalising my body with lemon/baking soda/apple cider vinegar drinks and lots of leafy greens.\n\nHowever, despite my valacyclovir regiment and healthy diet, I'm still experiencing persistent, though mild, symptoms and naturally it's become extremely frustrating.\n\nI've suffered from cold sores since I was a child, though I haven't had one in over a year, and I understand this is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life... It would just be nice if it would go away for at least some period of time and I could feel normal for a moment. I could deal with the occasional outbreak, but am I going to have to think about this every day?\n\nThanks for reading- any information/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":["Genital Herpes"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/1042/herpes-persisting-under-valacyclovir-treatment"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Erectile dysfunction","post_content":"I'm a 63 yr old male, 6', 200lbs, married.

I will continue to read more when I have the time. Most of what I found seemed to show that traditional treatments on their own do not work as well, and present a high probability for reoccurence. I see that the use of vitamin C, as outlined specifically in the first study (try to follow it as they had done in the trials with subjects for an effective outcome) works well, cutting the reoccurence of an outbreak in half. I've outlined the details for instruction of use.\n\nAdditionally, the use of traditional medical therapy to treat BV, specifically Metronidazole and Clindamycin, AS WELL AS with alternative therapies seems to show a lot of promise. I've outlined the alternative therapies and everything else in detail.\n\nI really hope this helps! I've been trying to find as many evidence-based studies as I can. Specifically ones that focus on isolating the specific bacteria that's at the source BV, and the biofilm that is the TRUE reason for recurrent outbreaks. I feel very thankful that scientists are actively working to find effective treatment for this problem that supposedly doesn't have a cure. Hope is on the horizon!\n\n\nProposed BV Treatment options [[My personal notes are in double brackets]]\n\nStudy name:\n\nEfficacy of Vitamin C Vaginal Tablets as Prophylaxis for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial; Vladislav N. Krasnopolskya, Vera N. Prilepskayab, Franco Polattic, Nina V. Zarochentsevaa, Guldana R. Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e\n\n-Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]].\n\n-Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]].\n\n-[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]]\n\n“A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “\n\n“The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “\n\nIn conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.”\n\n\nStudy name:\n\nBacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1*\n\n“Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.”\n\n\nCurrent available treatments:\n\nMetronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole.\n\nAlthough antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis.\n\n\nAlternative solutions:\n\n\nProbiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”:\n\n“In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “\n\n“In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).”\n\n“Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011). These findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an abnormal vaginal microflora, reinforcing the hypothesis that probiotics could eradicate vaginal pathogenic biofilms and restore the normal microflora in in vivo situations.”\n\n“It has also been proposed that prebiotics [[such as the product Multigyn FloraPlus]], nutritional substances that stimulate the growth of probiotics, could be used as alternative to treat BV (Roberfroid, 2007). Interestingly, Rousseau and colleagues demonstrated that prebiotic preparations containing oligosaccharides were able to promote the growth of beneficial lactobacilli strains but not of the pathogenic microorganisms often found in urogenital infections including G. vaginalis (Rousseau et al., 2005). “\n\n“Later, Zeng and colleagues compared the efficacy of a prebiotic gel containing sucrose with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to treat BV (Zeng et al., 2010). In that study, the prebiotic gel displayed a similar therapeutic cure rate to metronidazole, having a major advantage of quicker restoration of the normal vaginal microflora. Recently, Coste and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of another prebiotic gel, applied as adjuvant therapy [[combined with antibiotic treatment]], in women treated for BV and showed an improved recovery of the normal vaginal flora, reducing the risk of recurrences (Coste et al., 2012).\n\n\nPlant-derived compounds:\n\n“Surprisingly, up to now only one study evaluated the capability of plant-derived compound to eradicate BV biofilms. Interestingly, Braga and colleagues showed that thymol, a molecule present in thyme essential oil, had an inhibitory effect upon both newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms, which supports the importance of exploring essential oils and their main constituents as therapeutic alternative to treat BV (Braga et al., 2010). Furthermore, the expectations on essential oils as effective agents against BV-biofilms can be inferred from studies in other related vaginal biofilms (Palmeira-de-Oliveira et al., 2012; Bogavac et al., 2015).” [[The suggested delivery was through douche]].\n\n\n\nAcidifying/buffering agents:\n\n-“Recently, Bahamondes and colleagues verified that a soap containing lactic acid and lactoserum could be used for external intimate hygiene, reducing BV recurrence after treatment with oral metronidazole (Bahamondes et al., 2011). “\n\n-“Interestingly, vitamin C, when coated with silicon, allowed the constant release of the active agent, resulting in a long-lasting vaginal low pH and prevention of vaginal irritation (Polatti et al., 2006). Other studies reported an effective and safe use of vaginal vitamin C tablets in BV treatment (Petersen et al., 2011), contributing to improve abnormal vaginal pH and microflora, especially in pregnant women (Zodzika et al., 2013). Additionally, the regular use of vitamin C during 6 days per month, for 6 months after successful BV treatment, was shown to decrease the risk of BV recurrence (Krasnopolsky et al., 2013).\n\n-“Another alternative comes in the form of buffering agents. Polycarbophil [[like the product Replens]] is a weak poly-acid that it is able to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells, acting as a buffer in the vaginal secretions (Milani et al., 2000). “\n\n-“Another agent that has been long used in the treatment of vaginal infections is boric acid (Van Slyke et al., 1981) [[This could be the 600 mg tablets from brands pH-D, BoriCap, Bona Dea, or Boric Balance as of a recent Google search]]. Recently, Reichman and colleagues reported that the use of boric acid in combination with a nitroimidazole reduce the BV recurrence (Reichman et al., 2009), suggesting a potential impact on BV biofilms. However, this need to be further studied and in vitro biofilm experiments will elucidate the role of boric acid in BV prevention.”\n\n\nConclusions and future directions:\n\nBV current approved therapies are not sufficient to deal with this multi-species biofilm-related vaginal disorder. Future, research should address biofilm communities with a particular emphasis on multi-species biofilms, a topic that only recently emerged (Castro and Cerca, 2015). By properly addressing the complex interactions established in multi-species biofilms, novel strategies will hopefully overcome the high recurrence and relapse rates associated with BV.","like_count":"0","tags":["Women's Issues"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/885/scientific-outline-of-proposed-treatments-for-bacterial-vaginosis"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Effects of Varicocele & Post-treatment","post_content":"I am 29 years old and have a varicocele with my left testicle.

In preparation for this and knowing often the asymptomatic shedding occurs, I made an appointment with my doctor to get a prescription for an anti-viral.\n\nI was a bit surprised to have my doctor tell me that he was basically just going to prescribe the medication for outbreak management. I have only had two outbreaks in the last three years (from what I know now I was misdiagnosed years ago when I had an initial outbreak and by a dermatologist of all people!) and he used having 6 outbreaks a year as a baseline of whether or not I would need daily suppressive therapy. I pressed him on this further with my concern of transmission to another person as my outbreaks are few and far between and are very mild (at least I can be thankful for that). I was told that as long as I'm using condoms and abstaining when I have outbreaks that I wont transmit it.\n\nI didn't feel like arguing with him and I sort of don't feel like I should argue with an experienced medical professional, but I thought this was how the medical community used to handle this (maybe around the 80's and 90's) until they better understood how often shedding occurred. From just about everything I've read that just doesn't seem true and condoms only protect the area they cover leaving everything else vulnerable to transmission. I know even with condoms and medication it is still possible, but the risk is greatly reduced. Does the advice I was given seem out of touch?\n\nThe only other conclusion I can try to grasp is that because I have such infrequent outbreaks I don't shed as much or there is less of a risk? I have yet to read anything that would back that up.\n\nIf it does seem off I don't feel like I can tell my doctor to prescribe me more for daily suppressant or that I disagree with his medical advice.

If she loves you then she will at least respect you for being honest with her and for giving her the right to make the best decision for herself.\n\nNow on to the helpful stuff!\n\nHere ( http://wb.md/2bMRVh9) is a really great resource to learn more about broaching the issue of genital herpes with her.

According to the article, being informed about genital herpes, choosing your words wisely, picking the right setting and the right time to tell your partner are all important aspects to take into consideration.\n\nHere are two resources that you can read together:\n\n1) Frequently Asked Questions When Your Partner Has Genital Herpes -- http://wb.md/2c519Ce\n\n2) What to do when your partner has genital herpes? -- http://wb.md/2bwdO25\n\nAt the end of the day, honesty is always the best policy!

It says that instead of indulging in the hopeless feelings from the breakup, redirect your energy into understanding your pain and to seek solace in the company of those who care about you.\n\nAlmost everyone has been in the position of feeling as though they will never find love again after a break up. This is a normal emotion to have. But you also have to realize that there is someone out there who is way more suited for you and who will accept you for exactly who you are. That, in my opinion, is unconditional love, which is the most enduring form of love. I truly believe that person is out there for you.\n\nYou did the right thing!
