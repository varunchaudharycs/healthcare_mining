Although this clicking is not particularly noticeable to others, it is indeed audible if they know to be listening for it or if we are in a quiet space. It is very audible to myself and, more importantly, very audible to a microphone. As an aspiring voice actor, this issue has caused me much consternation. I can't bring myself to submit auditions: the post production effort required to clean up my audio is excessive, much too excessive to expect clients to do for raw voice requests (which is the majority of what I can get from my agency). That's if the audio is even salvageable...sometimes the click falls on the very end of a word and it cant be edited out without damaging the word. I can't make the click not happen but I can control (to an extent) when it \"drops\" by keeping my soft palate in whatever position the the word I just spoke had it in, with the click then occurring when the palate relaxes. The click also occurs upon blowing air or upon release of puffing out my cheeks.\n\nA month or so after the clicking began, I developed an additional issue. My ears began to pop or crackle upon swallowing. This may have been spurred by sticking a cue tip too far in my ear, it may be unrelated. It occurs mostly in my right ear, sometimes my left, once in a while both ears. If its happening , its happening each time I swallow until it doesn't. It occurs more frequently if I've eaten dairy or something greasy. Sometimes I can stop the ear popping by hocking, flexing my soft palate, sucking back to clear my saliva from my palate or by whipping my head towards my shoulder.\n\nOccasionally my ears may softly ring for no more than 20 seconds.\n\nI saw a local ENT who performed a hearing test and measured the health of my ear drums. Tests show I have above average hearing and my eardrums seem to be in decent health with no perforations or fluid behind them. He shrugged and said he had no idea what was wrong and sent me to a neurotologist. The neurotologist inserted a long camera-type device and didn't see much out of the ordinary outside of my uvula flipping up when I swallow (this is not a noticeable sensation to me). He said my Eustachian tubes looked fine. He was able to visually correlate my theory that the clicking occurred upon relaxation of the soft palate. He did not know what the issue was but recommended I see an otolaryngologist and speech pathologist and that they consider a botox injection to my palate. This was a misguided recommendation on the line of thought I could be dealing with palatal myoclonus. My clicking is not the rhythmic, repeating clicking of PM, it is cause and effect: soft palate engagement -> relaxation-> click.\n\nThe otolaryngologist and speech language pathologist quickly ruled out the botox idea, did the camera look, again correlated the click to the soft palate, and decided TMJ was very unlikely but still had no idea why my ears might be popping. They did notice the odd bubble forming close to my eustacian tube opening. We also found out that the click was much less likely occur if I had my head chin to my chest. They recommended I try to cut back on caffeine and try a nasal saline spray. I have had a hard time cutting back caffeine but I have tried saline nasal spray and steroid nasal spay to no effect. I have also tried Neilmed sinus rinse twice daily to no effect. I have also tried twice daily steam inhalation to no effect.\n\nI have searched online for other cases like mine and have found very little except the odd person crying out for help. I did find this forum thread from 9 years ago (that died about 2 years ago) with a bunch of people who were dealing with the same or similar problem.\n\nhttps://forums.webmd.com/3/cold-and-flu-exchange/forum/3781\n\nIn all that time that thread was going, only one person said it more or less went away and even then he couldn't say why accept that he dealt with it for three years, gave up on fixing it, and it just went away one day. One of the more depressing patters I've noticed from that thread and other isolated cries for help I've come across is that we keep going to professionals and everyone either inserts their own area of expertise so they can say they came up with a diagnosis or they just flatout admit they have no idea what's wrong.\n\n\nInformation about me:\n\n- male, 26\n\n- lost 47 lbs in the last 10 months and had lost around 15-20 lbs by the time the clicking began (weight loss connection?)\n\n- uvula flips up when I swallow\n\n- I did not have any recent ear, sinus or throat infections or other issues that precipitated the clicking/popping\n\n- Clicking from speaking feels like its coming from a right \"side\" for the most part. Can occur from a left feeling \"side\" when speaking occasionally. I've noticed that clicking from both \"sides\" can occur when I swallow, blow air or just engage my palate.\n\nAudio of Clicking: https://soundcloud.com/macelortay/clicking-test-2","like_count":"4","tags":["Ear Problems","Throat Problems","Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"jk_nl","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Uncommon Issue: Clicking with apparent connection to engagement of the soft palate, ear popping when swallowing","resp_content":"Hello. I've had this exact same problem for about 1,5 years. I've listened to your recording on Soundcloud and my clicking sounds exactly the same. Maybe mine's even more pronounced.\nI know what you're going through. Went to an ENT who couldn't help me. Searched the entire web for solutions only to find people writing they had the same problem but no solution. Learning to live with it seemed to be the only thing to do.\nIt seems such a small problem but it can be really mentally exhausting. Especially when it affects your work. You write you're an aspiring voice actor, I'm a recording artist, so I know how obstructive this seemingly small problem can be.\nOn my search for 'clicking soft palate' and related searches I stumbled on pages about how to prevent snoring and apnea related stuff. First I ignored those until decided to read into it a bit. And that turned out to be a good decision.\nI've been doing palate exercises now for about a week and my clicking has reduced dramatically. I would say right now it's down to about 10% of what it used to be. I've posted about it here https://www.medhelp.org/posts/Ear--Nose--Throat/Clicking-noise-from-soft-palate/show/1916543 (it's the Sept 3 2018 post) and then I came across your post which is an even more accurate description of the problem.\nIt's kind of hard to describe the exercises here but I would advise you to google for 'strenghthen soft palate'. The exercise that works for me is the one where you blow into a straw. It's a anti snoring exercise which helps to make your palate tighter. For me this works and I can talk, sing and record freely again. Hopefully it will work for you as well. Good luck and let me know it works for you.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention a couple of things.\n1. For me as well it started in a period where I had lost about 15 lbs so maybe there is a weight loss connection indeed.\n2. My ears also click when I swallow. Sometimes just the right ear, sometimes just left, sometimes both.\n3. With me the soft palate clicking can occur on one or both sides of the palate.\n4. I had been flying prior to when the clicking started. And since I have very painful inner ears when on a plane, especially during landing, I believe there might be a connection to an inner ear pressure problem as well (it's all connected back there).\n5. There's no clicking when I talk while putting my chin on my chest and a lot of clicking when I talk while raising my chin.\n6. The clicking stays away a for few minutes after I ate or drank something.\n7. Strong coffee or bitter tea seems to make the clicking worse.\n8. You're right, it's not palatal myoclonus. It has to do with your soft palate being too loose.\n"},{"author":"hugo_hus","resp_time":"2 months ago","resp_title":"Is anyone, experiencing this issue, using electric toothbrush or electric shaver for face/head on regular basis?","resp_content":""},{"author":"macelortay","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Uncommon Issue: Clicking with apparent connection to engagement of the soft palate, ear popping when swallowing","resp_content":"Oh wow!

I gradually came back during the day but not as strong as it was, not by far.\nNow I start every day with a few exercises and if during the day I hear clicking when I talk I do a few extra exercises.\nI can do those without a straw now. You have to build up pressure in your mouth in a way that you feel it push against your palate. My adam’s apple lifts a bit when I do it, as if swallowing.\nI build up the pressure by inhaling and holding that breath. With that pressure in your mouth you can push against your palate. I’m not really sure how to describe it better.\nI combine the straw exercise with an exercise where I yawn or just open my mouth really wide, until I feel it in my jaw.

Finally some other people who have encountered the same issue. Have the excercises worked for you? I am going to try them out then!\nReply\njk_nl\n11 months ago\nHi! Yes, for me the exercises work very well. I start everyday doing them and my clicking has reduced dramatically. Most importantly, it's not on my mind every second of the day. So especially mentally it's a big relief.\nI’d say the clicking is down to less than 10 % of what it used to be.\nIt’s all about strengthening your soft palate. I do three exercises each morning that work really well for me.\nHere’s the drill:\n1. Yawn as wide as you can. Or just open your mouth as wide as you can. Try focussing on your palate and try raising it. It’s a matter of feeling what happens. After a while you’ll get the hang of it.\n2. Blow through a straw: Inhale, keep the air in your mouth and puff your cheeks. Then put your chin on your chest and slowly exhale through a straw. Or just blow on a finger if you don’t have a straw.\n3. Smile! Try to make the smile as wide as you can. At the same time try to build up pressure in your mouth and head (kind of hard to describe this) up to the point your head starts shaking and starts going red. If that makes sense… If you think, this must look creepy, you’re doing it right.\n\nEdit: About the ‘building up pressure’ part in step 3; I found this article about jet pilots who have a technique to fight g-forces. They force blood to their head to keep from passing out. It’s called the Hook maneuver.\n\nThis is the part that describes it:\n'Breathe in, and begin to say the word “Hook.” You should feel your glottis, the opening between your vocal cords, at the back of your throat. About three-quarters of the way through the word, before hitting the “K” sound, close your glottis and hold for 2.5 to 3 seconds.'\n\nHere’s the full article:\nhttps://gearpatrol.com/2017/10/04/hook-maneuver-agsm-tutorial/\n\nIf you do this right you can really build up the pressure and focus it on your palate.\n\nGood luck!\nReply\nvortex148\n11 months ago\nHi there! Thank you for replying! Do you use instagram, whatsapp or facebook? I would like to ask you more questions about them . Thank you :) I have been doing the excercises. The clicking intensity really changes a lot during the day, sometimes it is so THERE and sometimes I don't notice it or its very soft. There has been two times when I got a cold and the clicking vanished for that period of time. When I healed, it returned, such an odd thing, I think it is better to laugh haha. It is so ridiculous.\n1\nReply\nsingingfish\n10 months ago\nHi! I've got the same problem and it has been 3 years since the first time I noticed it. At first I noticed the clicking is associated with some specific sound of consonants like \"k\", \"t\", \"g\", later I found out it happens every time when the part behind nose is involved in some kind of \"stretch and release\" activity. So the clicking doesn't really require speaking. I can literally sit here and make it click all day at any frequency I want. Pure breathing in or out doesn't lead to clicking because no \"stretch and release\" is involved.\n\nI went to see a doctor and then a specialist. They did a CT scan of my sinus, also had a look inside my nose with a camera. All tests came out fine, except that they saw a small amount of mucus inside my nose and they thought this might be the cause. So I took their advise to take nose spray for allergy, and also saline spray and sinus irrigation every day. It has been almost 6 months now since I started the medicine, but I haven't seen much effect.\n\nThe clicking is mainly on my right side although sometimes it happens to both sides. The clicking is from deep inside and behind nose. Whatever is there cant be blown out. I even tried to reach the spot carefully with a cotton bud but it can't reach. I guess there's a turn at the back of nose, the clicking spot is above there and can't be reached from the nostril. But I'm sure my clicking comes from the nose, not the ear, not the throat or the palate.\n\nThere are a few situations that the click went away:\n1. When I had a bad cold and nose blocked with mucus;\n2. Temporarily goes away after I use sinus rinse (I guess the reason is similar to 1: nose filled with fluid);\n3. Temporarily goes away after I eat hot food or spicy food (maybe because more mucus are produced when eating hot and spicy food);\n4. \"Standing on head\" position.

Some suggestions:\n\nSome causes of hearing loss:\n- Middle Ear clogged in the Eustachian tubes, can be an infection or not. Called “Otitis Media”\n- Outer ear infection due to build up of earwax. An ENT can clean this out and might give you prescription ear drops. Don’t try to do this yourself. Called “otitis externa”. This can be bacterial. It is important to keep the ear dry.\n- A ruptured/perforated eardrum. It is very important to rule that out so you do not lose additional hearing. The ENT should refer you for additional auditory tests.\n- Exposure to very loud noise\n——-\nSee your doctor ASAP. Make sure you talk about any other symptoms and remind them of your pneumonia. Then ask for an emergency ENT appointment.\n- Are you in pain, if so, where?\n- Were you on antibiotics with pneumonia, or was it viral? Are you on them now?\n- The important thing to remember about imaging is that it rules out major issues, but having a negative result does not mean there is not something wrong.\n- Did the ENT tell you why you received steroid shots? Were you given ear drops, prescription nasal sprays, told to take decongestants?\n——-\n- Is your only current symptom hearing loss? Do you sometimes hear a high pitched ringing in your ears?\n- Do you have a fever, cough, sinus congestion?\n- Were any other blood tests done besides the high WBC count? Were There any other abnormal results?\n\nUntil you know what is wrong, it is difficult to give advice. It is possible that the cause for your current hearing issue is not the same as it was before.\n\nIf you are having recurring hearing loss from the same cause, it might be chronic.

I have experienced post nasal drainage longer than I can remember and I have always had a suspicion that this was the because of my bad breath. Later, after seeing an ENT to remove my swollen adenoids due frequent nasal infections, they discovered two small holes in the roof of my mouth. I was told these holes should have closed at birth but for some reason they did not. The physician seemed to brush it off like it was nothing at the time but did however mention if it continues to be an issue, I may need to have surgical intervention. After my adenoids were removed I experienced a dramatic reduction in sinus infections but the drainage was still there. I am constantly having to spit and I frequently feel the accumulation of tiny food particles following meals. All these symptoms are accompanied by a bad taste and smell in my mouth; almost rotten. The smell diminishes after I vigorously clean my teeth but never for more that a day or so. If this isn’t enough to deal with, I recently discovered I have moderate to severe GERD and this has led to a complete dietary shift. I now eat very little meat and almost no spices or milk products. After all this, the smell is still there. Currently I am waiting to receive the results of a test that measures the PH levels in my esophagus and wouldn’t you know, the doctor who performed the procedure commented on the deformation in the roof of my mouth. If this PH test comes back negative I am out of options. Every doctor I see points me in a different direction and I get the feeling they think Its all in my head.

My 16 year old son had a deviated septum surgery in January (2019). He seemed to be healing normally in his post-op visit, but by late February and March, we were noticing he still was congested and could not breathe any better than before surgery. We took him in for a follow up appointment and they took a culture and discovered staph infection in his nasal passages. He was treated with oral antibiotics. They didn't work, so he was prescribed an antibiotic/steroid rinse. That only irritated him worse, so he was given an ointment to use for a while in his nostrils. Symptoms were still there, so we got another culture and they discovered a bacterial strain called klebsiella. Oral antibiotics were given that it was responsive to in the lab (very strong version of Bactrim). Culture after finishing that was clear infection. Symptoms soon returned. Another culture was taken and came back showing staph again except it is now a strain that is resistant to many antibiotics except for some stronger ones that they don't like to prescribe for children who are still growing, like Levaquin.\n\nWe have gotten a referral to an infectious disease doctor who sees kids his age and are waiting to hear back for an appointment now. I am very worried about how all of this is going with the strains of infection becoming more and more difficult to treat and always coming back. We have also done different types of rinses, like chito rhino, we've taken oral probiotics like lanto sinus and rinse/swished with them, we've done prolonged flonase use, etc, all along with the antibiotic treatments we've been prescribed. He has never tested positive for any type of fungal infection, but with all the antibiotics he's been given, we figure he needs to replenish with good bacteria. Besides the fact that we are heartbroken he is having to go through this, our son has a huge love for running and participates in cross country and track at the state level. We try to help him take very good care of himself and don't want him having to use anything that is going to damage his body or stop him from doing what he loves. But most importantly we just want him well. I'm posting this just to see if anyone has any experience with a similar situation or any insight to give us that might be helpful.

It has been a probably for over ten years and usually is brought on by a cold . it use to take about three visits to the general doctor before they would prescribe any antibiotics. By then it usually turns into sinusitis or bronchitis by that time. Usually after a few weeks it goes away. I do have a respiratory doctor who has made things so much easier for me, but this last time has been the worst I have ever had, it has been horribly relentless. I am already on a prescribed acid reflux, medication, which they have already increased, and have been for years. I have used the naso-rinse religiously but it is only temporary. I have been on Suda-fed, Tesla pills, antihistamines, saline spray, Cough syrup, and now I have just been prescribed an inhaler and prednisone for the next 20 days.\nWith this last round of post nasal drip and cough, I cough mostly when I talk, eat or even get up and walk around. If I sit still and don't move or talk much, I don't cough a lot.I sleep well and it doesn't seem to affect me until I am up and around in the morning. I lay in bed and don't want to move because I know I will start coughing.I try to lay on my left side at night elevated a bit which seems to help a lot. I really hardly ever wake up from coughing but if I wake up and get up I cough. I have the constant collection of phlegm in the back of my throat and sometimes have difficulty swallowing to the point I have press on my throat to be able to swallow. I have had cough attacks so bad that in order to take a breath I have to stick something down my throat and clear the mucus. I drink a lot of water and try to drink teas and stuff. in the past I have has my throat scoped and breathing treatments and have had my nasal passage inspected and they seem to find nothing.\nI am hoping the prednisone and inhaler will help to clear this up but I am on the fourth day and there is no measurable change. I have heard about Oregano oil and think a few years ago I did try the pills and don't remember it doing anything. I have had to take time off work at a critical time because I can't go even talk or even get up and do things because the cough is relentless.

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat.\n\nAround when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through \"fuzzy\", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound.\n\nMy eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone.\n\nMy blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night.\n\nMy symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had \"drop attacks\" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.\n\nI have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears.\n\nI have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up.\n\nI have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did.\n\nI have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident.\n\nI will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety.\n\nI have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking \"I don't want to be alive any more\" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this.\n\nPlease, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse.

For about 7 months now I have felt like there is something stuck in my throat. I am constantly clearing my throat, and when I do, the feeling goes away briefly, but returns minutes later. Some days are worse than others, but when I clear my throat there is definitely mucus in the back of it. It seems like post-nasal drip, BUT it gets worse with certain foods/drinks, such as caffeine, carbination. I have a history of acid reflux, and have been on and off antacids, but that has't helped the clogged throat at all.\n\nI went to an ENT about 5 months ago. She did a nasal endoscopy and said everything looked fine (I had slightly excessive mucus, but nothing concerning). So she orginially thought it could be allergies. She gave me a prescription nasal spray and recommended coupling it with an over-the-counter saline spray and Allegra. I did that for about a month and didn't notice a significant difference. My throat still felt clogged nonstop.\n\n*** I want to note that there is no pain, just EXTREME discomfort as I am feeling like a lump is in the back of my throat 24/7.\n\nSo after the attempt at solving the problem with allergy medication did not work, she thought it might be the acid reflux creeping into my esophagus. She prescribed me Omerprazole, which I took for about a month or so, and still noticed no difference.\n\nThe final measure I took with this ENT doctor, was a wallow scan. She sent me to a lab where I had an x-ray while I swallowed a liquid (apologies for the non-technical language). Essentially, this test would show what was happening when I swallow, i.e. is it going down and back up my throat, is it getting stuck somewhere, etc. The results came back and they said it was completely normal... stale mate.\n\nShe then referred me to a gastroenterologist. He unfortunately was of no help. He basically said that this issue needs to be resolved by an ENT because the upper throat is not in \"his area.\" He also said that the sensation I have in my throat may just be in my head. Not helpful and not true. He said I could take an antihistamine and that might help.\n\nAnyway, I haven't been to another doctor yet, but I have scheduled an appointment with a new ENT next week. I just figured it would be worthwhile to post this and see if anyone has any insights or thoughts to share.\n\nQuick breakdown of what I am experiencing:\n- 24/7 feeling that something is stuck in my throat / tightness\n- Constant throat clearing\n- Heightened symptoms after drinking caffeine or carbonation\n- Mucus in back of throat","like_count":"1","tags":["Throat Problems","Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"jkstein","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Constant throat clearing / mucus","resp_content":"I have had the exact same problem for at least 5 years with no luck from doctors either.

By the next day I was feeling very fatigued with a stiff neck, nausea, pressure in the back of my head and pain between shoulder blade and spine. Later that day the left side of my face and left half of my tongue became numb. This continued. On June 6th I was walking at work and became extremely lightheaded and had to sit down immediately. I left work and went to the ER where they took a CT scan of my brain and blood lab tests which both came back normal. They said it was probably a pinched nerve and sent me home with a Rx of 5, 50mg Prednisone tablets. By June 8th I felt the worse that I ever had. I was extremely fatigued and still in a lot of pain. My head felt like it weighed 50 pounds. By June 13th the facial and tongue numbness had started to subside but I was still having pain behind the ear, facial spasms, neck pain and head pressure and dizziness. June 17th I had an appointment with my family doctor where I was I told I possibly had Bell's Palsy. At this time the facial and tongue numbness was pretty much gone. All other symptoms were still there but not as bad. She checked my ears and said my left ear drum looked bulged and both ears appeared to have fluid around them. She called for an MRI of my brain and neck and referred me to a Neurologist and an ENT specialist. The MRI of the brain came back normal and the MRI of the neck showed 2 midline bulging discs at C6 and C7 which I already knew about as I had been told about them years ago. She said that I could benefit from another round of steroids and gave me a Decadron injection as well as a prescription for a Prednisone taper pack. I felt improvement that lasted for about a week. On July 1st I got a pulsating headache behind my eyes and left temple. I couldn't stand it any longer so I went to the ER in the next town over where they gave me an IV injection of steroids and a migraine cocktail. The following day I had a dentist appointment to see if any of my symptoms were dental related. They took xrays and found that I have 4 impacted wisdom teeth with one that has broken through the gum. I was scheduled for removal the next day but the oral surgeon would not sedate me due to my headaches and dizziness. He wanted me to see my neurologist first but said the wisdom teeth definitely need to come out soon because one of them had a pocket of fluid around it. He said my jaw muscles had a lot of tension and they were very tender. Side note: I have had TMJ disorder for around 15 years. July 18th I start getting the ear pain and pressure in my right ear. Before it was only the left side and my right side felt fine. On this day I see the neurologist who confirmed the Bell's Palsy and some physical tests to check my nerve function. She looked in my ears and also said I have fluid behind my ear drum and recommended an ENT, which I already had an appointment for. She asked me to wait around 3 more months if possible to have my wisdom teeth removed as she felt it could worsen my other symptoms. July 25th I go to the ENT appointment which ended up being a waste of time. The Dr here was very rude and seemed rushed. I tried to give him backstory on my symptoms but he wouldnt listen and kept talking over me. He barely tapped the Otoscope to my ears and said they looked perfect. He told me to take Motrin for pain and sent me home. So, it has been nearly 7 weeks since the start of all this. I am still dealing with pretty much constant pressure in the back of my head and ears. My ears feel full like they need to be popped but popping doesnt help. I still have random days where the pain behind my ear and neck pain/stiffness is worse. I have been taking ibuprofen everyday for the past 2 weeks or so. No one can seem to figure out what caused all of this to happen and why I'm still having this weird head and ear pressure all the time. I don't understand why all of this has moved from the left ear to the right. Some days it will be both ears. Some days I will have what feels like sinus pressure on my cheekbones and brow bone. Also, I will get random tender points on my face that comes and goes. When pressed it feels like its bruised but it isnt. This has been the most bizarre experience I have ever had in my life. I have been a fairly healthy person and hadn't had an illness before this in over 3 years. Has anyone else experienced anything like this before or had these symptoms? Could it be wisdom teeth? Sinus? Viral?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/95494/pain-behind-ear-pressure-in-head-neck-pain"},{"post":{"author":"kerissad","post_time":"8 months ago","post_title":"HELP!!! Dog bite resulted in lose of cartilage in nose and infection—VERY SERIOUS!!","post_content":"Hello,\nI am writing on behalf of my sister in law. A year and a half ago her dog bit her on the bottom of her nose causing extensive damage. The cartilage In between the nostrils deteriorated and has fallen off leaving an open slit wound—effectively leaving her with the appearance of 3 nostrils.\nShe has visited various EMTs and plastic surgeons within the Dallas Ft. Worth area but everyone says the same thing—they “have never seen anything like it”, check her nose to see if the condition has worsened and then schedule another follow-up appointment in 2-3 weeks. A few months after the injury a plastic surgeon performed a skin flap procedure in an attempt to fix the appearance of her nose. It was unsuccessful because it was soon very apparent there were some MAJOR issues inside the nose that needed to be addressed first because the pressure within her wound quickly “blew” open the stitches.\nAfter it was concluded that a cosmetic fix would only work after the underlying problems within her nose were addressed and completely gone she began to see EMTs to solve the problems that were taking place within her nose and sinuses.\nThe unknown issues have resulted in headaches, lots of pressure throughout the nose and into the sinuses and leakage from her nose.\nShe has been using Aquaphor on the wound to keep it moist but the build up of pressure inside her nose is so bad that it causes the Aquaphor and other tissue, cartilage, and possibly homeopathic ointment that had hardened out of her nose causing great pain—She has described the feeling as “giving birth” or going through pregnancy labor within her nose. Her nose is swollen and continues to become more so causing great concern.\nThe exterior of the bottom of her nose in between the nostrils doesn’t appear to be the root of her issue even though she now has three openings. The slit or other nostril (the place where there is normally cartilage) is the place where the discharge comes from which causes everyone to believe there is something behind that which may be the “root of the problem”.\nAs previously stated she has been to various EMT and plastic surgeons within the DFW area in the last 18 months with no real resolution. She recently developed an infection which included the presence of pus on the wound within her nose which she is taking antibiotics for now.\nShe complains of having inflamed sinuses and sever headaches—which have worsened within the last 3 weeks.\nThe doctors that she has visited thus far have all said they have never seen a case like hers but because she is so stoic about it all they don’t seem to prioritize her case. Her pain has become almost unbearable and yet she still goes to work and pushes through.\nAs a family we are very concerned that an infection could reach her brain or bloodstream, etc. We can see that her condition has worsened and we are in desperate need for a doctor who can help her, so I am putting her case on medical forums hoping that someone somewhere can help. Please contact me if you might know of someone that can help or has heard of a similar situation. Additional information, details and pictures can be provided. PLEASE PASS THIS INQUIRY ON.

I can feel and see for example also a fasciculation on my calfs (but sometimes even on other parts of my body). The Eustachian Tube is ok, ENT said.\n\nThe spasm feels like a \"clicking\" sound in my ear and it it the worst during speaking when conversation is somewhat stressful for me. It occurs then mainly during swallowing but generally it occurs virtually whenever (but in less intensity). Maybe it is worse in the morning after getting up. I feel that my ear is then sometimes \"tired\".\n\nI had noticed this problem about one month ago and now it has devoloped in chronic nature.\n\nI' ve been taking Lexaurin (Bromazepamum) (according to my ENT advice) (so far 2x1,5 mg a day, and now I'm starting to take 3x1,5 MG a day, 1 tbl in the morning and 2 tbls in the evening) along with magnesium, b-complex vitamins and other balanced vitamins and minerals (calcium and magnesium 2:1). So far with no significant effect. I am maybe a less anxious but the spasm in my right ear still continues. I know that I should rid off stress as much as possible but trouble is that spasm anxious me, it isn't accompanied with pain but it is annoying anyway so it's some kind of \"vicious circle\".\n\nI'm considering to change Lexaurin for Myolastan (Tetrazepamum) which should have larger myorelaxant effect.\n\nBut in general, I want to take these psychofarmacs only for a necessary period of time.\n\nThan I have question. Do you think that repeated politzeration could help? To somewhat \"loose\" the muscle? I'm aware of autopolitzerating my ear and I do it sometimes and seems to help a bit but without any long lasting effect.\n\nI'm thinking also about some muscle relaxation psysical exercise but when the muscle is in my ear I don't know how. Then I'm considering some massage or other \"alternative\" methods like acupunctury.\n\nWhat are your treatment suggestions or advice? Do you think it will, itself, go away in time if i try to be stress free as much as possible?\n\nThank you in advance. I very much appreciate it.\n\nJan Dob. Czech Republic. The Old Continent ).\n\nP.S. I have felt these muscle contractions in my ear already about twice in my lifetime, so I have probably more sensitive nerves here, but it has been only a momentary matter and then it went away immediately. But now the stress I've been through, was so great and long lasting, that it has developed to this chronic matter.\n\nI don't have any other problems with my ears and I have never have them in my life time (except for those stated above).\n\nAgain.

About 8 years ago, my body flipped out on me. The left side of my face would feel tight , go numb, or would be painful in the teeth and jaw. The ENT did find a sinus infection and put me on strong antibiotics to treat it. However, I also started taking Zoloft to deal with the anxiety caused by the symptoms. Well after years of tapering down, I finally got off Zoloft a couple of months ago. Then about 5 weeks ago, I get a cold that turns into a terrible sinus infection. Then, on the left side, the facial numbness, jaw pain, and tooth pain can back fool force. I've also had some sensitive breathing. I'm wondering if maybe Zoloft helps to mute this symptoms while I was on it so they were more bearable. Does anyone know if a sinus infection can cause half of your face to fill numb?

I basically had it happen when i got a nasty ear infection and for some reason, it gave me PET. About a year ago during June, left side of my face, mainly the nerves controlling my eye, started twitching uncontrollably and burning. I believe the nerve damage occurred because I kept forcing my ear tube to shut by doing a technique where i would pinch my nose while breathing deeply. the always open tube usually would close for a few seconds before opening again and it just became a bad stupid habbit I did when I was bored. But this time when I did, i was able to keep it closed for 30 min to maybe even 1 hour, and when it opened, I heard the sound of it popping open and felt something was wrong immediately. I obviously panicked, but I did not have the insurance to see neurologist or whatever they're called, and to be honest I didn't even know what was happening to me at the time so I was just in shock. I waited it out and it wad scary at the start. the first month was terrible. constant burning and twitching. the second month was bad not as bad. between the second and third month, I could tell it healed because I had more control of my face. the months following I had more control of my face, but my nerves will still twitch if I use them to hard, like shutting my eye really hard. I believe keeping my usually open ear unnaturally closed for an hour caused too much pressure and damaged my nerves. I wish I never did it... but I can't reverse it now. I live with constant fear that my nerve damage will get worse. I would like to know besides going to the doctor and getting botox and facial paraylsis surgery, what is the best way to treat my damaged nerves from possibly getting worse? P.S. I don't have full facial paraylsis or bells palsy, which that's not what I have. my face is still 70 to 80% controllable and it's not even noticable that I have nerve damage. so please, what can I do to keep this from getting worse without paying so much money?","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/92066/patulous-eustachian-tube-causes-facial-nerve-damage"},{"post":{"author":"mrbouchard","post_time":"11 months ago","post_title":"Worried step-father","post_content":"My 8 year old, step daughter had a experience with recurring tonsilitis recently, some antibiotics did help but the doctors seem to dismiss it as \"normal\", she has also has redness in her outer cheeks as what you yould see in someone with high blood pressure.

Their answer was the same, \"I don't see anything wrong with your ear\", so when i visited the 4th and final doctor, he told me that he strongly believes it's anxiety and that i should just try to stop reacting to it, the truth is i did have some anxiety issues before all that, but they were gone.

I thought perhaps the first time it was because of not throwing away my toothbrush; the second time who knows. During the 3rd course, I've thrown out my ear plugs, all my lipsticks and chapsticks, toothbrush, (again), laundered everything I've slept in or worn for the last month, etc. Before the 3rd course of antibiotics, azithromycin, an ENT told me I had laryngeal reflux (LPR) and post nasal drip. When challenged about symptoms going away quickly with antibiotics he said it was due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the antibiotics, which when researched doesn't seem to be very strong with beta-lactams, the type of antibiotic family of the first 2 courses. My symptoms were lessening some - tonsils less swollen and fewer white spots, feeling a bit less generally icky - when I visited my PCP again out of frustration, and she gave me an Rx for the azithromycin and told me to fill it if I got worse again. When symptoms still hadn't resolved, and I was getting some stomach issues (excessive burping, and soreness in the stomach area) after another week I went ahead with the antibiotics. I was tested for strep twice in the beginning (negative), and later requested that what I did have be cultured, but apparently they don't really do that any more. I am feeling a bit better, but not 100% even after nearly a week post z-pack. I am mainly following the instructions for the LPR, as this may be underlying, but I don't think it's the main cause of sudden onset of what looks like tonsillitis and other symptoms, so I'm not 100% diligent. I share all this to say it's worth going to the MD, but if you can see a specialist, I would, despite my experience not being good with the ENT. If things haven't cleared for me soon I am likely to seek out an infectious disease specialist. I'm not quite sure what else to do. Please continue to post here if you learn something more, and I will, too.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/81297/throat-infection---white-spots"},{"post":{"author":"thefallen1988","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Post-Nasal drip","post_content":"I've had a cold for the last couple of days and I've noticed that I've got some drainage going on now.

It's a somewhat long read but I hope you read it...\n\nTL;DR: 9 years of 24/7 nasal congestion. 2 surgeries and years of various medical regimens have provided no relief.\n\nProblem: Nasal congestion 24/7/365.\n\nWhen it started: Around 9 years ago, I came down with a pretty bad cold. After the cold symptoms went away, the nasal congestion stayed.\n\nAfter seeing an ENT specialist several times (around 2010), they believed the nasal congestion was caused by GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) even though I have zero heartburn. They had me start taking Prilosec for for a few months and sleep with my bed on a slight incline so that the stomach acids could not flow into my throat due to gravity to see if this helped the symptoms. I was using Flonase as well. None of this made a change.\n\nFast forward to about 2014 and I was still dealing with the same nasal congestion. I decided to start seeing an ENT again to see if I could get to the bottom of this. First I was put on a Sudafed/Flonase regimen for a few months. No change. Was put on a local raw honey regimen to see if it was allergies causing the congestion. No change (which I already knew was going to be the result because it started in MA where I was born and raised and I've lived in IL and now CA since).\n\nI was referred to an Allergy specialist where they performed an allergy test where they poke the 40 something needles into your back to see what you react to. The only things I reacted to were a few types of grass that are not present in my current region or anywhere I have ever been.\n\nNow I was finally referred to an ENT where my nasal passage was scoped a few times. It showed redness and inflammation in my turbinates but that's about it. We decided to move forward with a Turbinate Reduction surgery (2014) as well as a slight deviated septum correction. The deviated septum was very very minor and did not cause blockage but the doctor figured since we are already going in there we might as well take care of that as well.\n\n6 months after the surgery, the congestion was slightly less but still there. Then eventually it went back to the way it was pre-surgery and the turbinates were inflammted still. I elected to move forward with another Turbinate Reduction surgery (2015) and understood this was pretty much the last time I could do this procedure as anymore reduction would start causing negative effects.\n\nFast forward to present day, OCT 2018, my nasal congestion is still present all day every single day. Throughout the years, I've used a Netipot, quit smoking, quit drinking, been put on Azelastine Hydrochloride spray. The only relieve I get is from a nasal decongestant like Afrin but I don't use it as it just makes it worst if I use it longer than a few days. I also get relieve when I'm using the Breathe Right nasal strips when I sleep.\n\nIt's honestly frustrating and I would really love to be able to breathe normally again.","like_count":"0","tags":["Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: 9 years of nasal congestion","resp_content":"Try eliminating dairy, eating organic, and changing out your pillow for a non allergenic one and clean the sheets at least once a week.

I figured I'd try again.\n\nEvery once in a while I get this horrible, excruciating pain in the external, left ear, on the area that's labeled \"concha\", if you look at a picture of outer ear anatomy. It started over a year ago and it comes so randomly. I want to a ER/walking clinic once while I was experiencing the pain. They prescribed me antibiotics in which I never took because the pain suddenly dissappeared, as suddenly as it came on! That's what happens. It will come on suddenly and then just stop as if a switch was flipped, an hour or so later.\n\nNothing really alleviates the pain. Not even Advil. Every so often I am able to tug or press on the area and I'll ear a pop (an external pop, not the kind you hear when you swallow). It sounds like when you crack a knuckle, and then the pain will suddenly go away. That doesn't always work though and so sometimes it last a few hours and then just disappear.\n\nWhen the pain is there it's horrible. It's achey and sometimes shooting. I can't turn my head or I'll geta really sharp pain. Forget touching that part of my ear, it's so tender. Sometimes my ear will feel hot and get red on the rim of my cartilage. It's really painful.\n\nIve been examined before while the pain was going on and they saw nothing unusual. I always ask my husband to look at my ear when it's happening, and he sees nothing. I went to see an endocrinologist who tested me for several autoimmune disorders and he ruled out Relapsing polychondritis (which seems to be the only disorder that matches my symptoms).\n\nIt's so frustrating because when I'm having an episode it hurts so bad, I feel like I cannot function and I get really touchy and agitated. Every doctor tells you to come when you're having it but even though I've been logging my episodes, I cannot predict when I'm going to have one! It just happens like turning on a switch, in the middle of the day, and it goes away that same way.\n\nWeirdly enough too I've notice that I get it a lot more during the week before my period.\nI've narrowed it down to three possible causes after I've been actively logging episodes.\n\n1) I have mild psoriasis on my scalp. Recently I noticed very small patch of it behind my right ear, right in the fold, where your ear adjoins to your neck. I have read that you can gerbil psoriasis actually inside your ear canal. I wonder if that's what it is and maybe it effects a nerve that goes to my outer ear. Sometimes I pour peroxide in my ear during an episode and the pain dissappears. I also apply a steroid cream to the painful area.\n\n2) the other culprit is my headphones but this one I'm not to sure of. I often fall asleep with headphones in my left ear. They are the earbud type that come with iPhones. I know you shouldn't do that, but it happens. while I believe it can be them, I wonder why I don't get the pain every time I fall asleep like that. I will only get it 1-2 times out of every ten times I fall asleep with them in.\n\nI know other people out there are experiencing this too!

I'm a 33 year old guy in good health who woke up one morning to find my left ear felt clogged. Within a few days, the problem went away on it's own and I felt back to 100%. A few weeks later, same problem. I woke up one morning and my left ear is clogged again. Just like the first time, a few days pass and I'm back to feeling normal. Well, I woke up on March 17th (which is going on about two weeks now) and lo and behold my left ear is clogged again. This time it hasn't gone away or shown any improvement.\n\nNow in addition to my ear feeling that sort of clogged/muffled feeling I'm also getting an annoying hum and at times an echo. Here's where things get strange though. Everything I have looked up on tinnitus describes people having a constant ring/hum/buzz, whatever you want to call it, that gets worse at night whenever things quiet down. I suppose this makes the noise more noticeable. This is the exact opposite of what I'm experiencing. When I lay down at night in silence, my ear makes no noise at all. I can sleep without a problem. It's when I get up and the noise of daily life begins, people talking, TV on, radio on, water running, doors closing, etc, is when my ear starts this very annoying hum/echo sound. If I put my finger in my ear to block out the noise, it immediately stops. If I'm in a quiet environment, it's not noticeable. It's as though something is going on inside my ear to where once the sound enters, it's being distorted because sound itself is triggering this noise.\n\nI've been to an ENT who said everything looked fine and was moving fine. She ruled out earwax and fluid in the ear as a cause. I have an appointment set for a hearing test and a followup with the ENT in a few weeks but I wanted to ask here in the meantime. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any suggestion as to what this could be? I thought it could be a eustachian tube problem but I didn't notice a bit of difference after trying some of the exercises shown on YouTube.\n\nAny help is appreciated and if I can be more specific or provide any further information, I'll be happy to.

About a year ago, after moving into a new college dorm on campus, I developed a sinus infection along with a whole slew of symptoms doctors couldn't seem to put together. It has progressed to just being 24 hour sinus congestion with post nasal drip and the occasional brain splitting headache.\nI have gone to specialists but all of their treatments seem to only relieve me temporarily. After trying every over the counter medication available, I have been put on antibiotics in the beginning of this illness, then was given prednisone twice. I was also told to do sinus rinses with budesonide which doesn't seem to be doing anything anymore.\nMy only relief is hot showers and medicated nasal spray. The shower's relief only lasts about 20 minutes and the nasal spray I can't use all the time.\nIt seems to get worse when I drink milk and ice cream, which lead my boyfriend into thinking I have a dairy allergy. However, I don't feel any worse when consuming other dairy products. I still cut out dairy and nothing changed. It just gets worse with dairy, so I cannot explain that.\nI'm worried that my only other option will be surgery, as all the treatments that I have had so far seems to do nothing. A new symptom has popped up, popping and itchy on the inside bit of my ears. I have had a CT scan and there has been no signs of deviated septums or polyps. All they say is that I am severely inflamed.\nHas anyone else experienced these issues, or know someone who has a similar story to mine? Any idea on what the cause could be?

After the fire alarm went off, my ears were hurting a bit but everything went back to normal.\n\nI came home a few hours later and fell asleep on the the couch. When I woke up I noticed my tinnitus was way louder than usual, I was dizzy, all sound has became sensitive to my ears, have nausea, diarrhea, hot and cold flashes, and my ears feel like I have an ache in them. (my ear felt like fluid was inside causing an ear ache)\n\nI searched online for answers to see if I was coming down with something, as multiple people at work were getting sick. To no avail, I found nothing useful of what I was going through as all my symptoms carried over to too many multiple diagnoses.\n\n4 days after all of this I went to an urgent care to get seen because nothing is changing and sometimes I feel like my symptoms are getting worse. The doctor told me that I have some liquid behind my ear and my throat is slightly swollen.\n\nPrior to this I told him last week I had a sore throat, (which I assumed was strep throat), and like I always do I take over the counter medicine and wait it out. Unfortunately my throat has been swollen with no pain for the whole time leading up to the other incident and symptoms.\n\nThe doctor said that the tube that goes from my throat to my ears are filled with the liquid from a sinus infection and they will clear in time as my infection leaves my body. He said this is causing my middle ear to be muffled inside, even if it doesn't sound like it, and it's causing my ears to be sensitive to noise which is making my tinnitus sound like it's more potent then normal.\n\nI was advised to take 3 ibuprofen every 6 hours until swelling in my throat dissipate's and if nothing changes within 3 days to come back for further evaluation. Also the nurse that took my vitals said my temperature and blood pressure are normal but she's seen more people this past week for sinus infection than usual due to the weather and allergies.\n\nWhere I'm getting at through my whole story is if there's anything I can do to help sooth my tinnitus sound until this all clears up. I'm used to my tinnitus and have lived with it for so long that it's part of my normal life, but with the sound becoming more distinguished and potent, it's driving me a little bit insane.\n\nMy hope is that the case of my tinnitus being so loud is due to the liquid and muffled ears, because when I muffle my ears with my hands the ringing sounds normal like it used to. However when I un-muffle my ears the sound isn't like it used to be prior to all of this.\n\nIt's very hard to even fall asleep right now even with a background white noise due to this situation. I used to be able to fall asleep by just focusing in on a fan or music but now the ringing is over masking all of this, which would make sense if my ears are being muffled.\n\n\nQuestions:\n1. What will help clear a sinus infection? (viral bacterial infection as I believe the doctor called it)\n2. Is there hope the tinnitus will dissipate?\n3. What other helpful insight is there on background noise to help sooth the ringing while I sleep?","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems","Cold","Throat Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/62605/sinus-infection-and-tinnitus"},{"post":{"author":"jenniferh34","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Ears checked","post_content":"I am off balance and unsteady all the time.

Even his website lists only topical suggestions.\nI asked Dr. Mercola's customer service to pass on to him that there are many of us who, in treating our scalps, had one or a couple run up our nose as an escape and are breeding in there now. The customer service person was shocked and said he would pass it on to Dr. Mercola with a rush request to ask if there is anything he could suggest.\nI told him about the other web md lice and nasel message board.

So she's healthy- except for the fact that she's gotten strep 12 times since she was 4 months old. It's almost once a month. Then we think she's better, and go in for a check up- guess what, she has strep! There's been 2 times where it didn't test positive for strep, but it looked like strep; both of those times she had to be on 2 rounds of Antibiotics to kick the infection. They've given her antibiotics (amox, ceph, etc) every time. She was getting ear infections each time she got sick, so they put tubes in her ears around three months ago. Since then she has been on antibiotics a total of 23 days, and now we are starting again with some more strep. They thought with so much blockage in her ears, the infection was staying trapped in there, and that when it would leak out randomly, causing her to have another throat infection. But now, they are just saying that she will probably get strep every time she's exposed to it at all. We already use germX or wet wipes after every outing, park, library etc. And everytime she's sick, I disinfect everything 3 days into the antibiotics.\n\nI feel like we can't hang out with other kids anymore, with out her getting strep like 5 days after. And when she's sick we don't go around them until the Dr looks at her and says she's well. So now, she's terrified and TOTALLY NOT used to kids her age, and only likes older kids & adults. I buy toys that are easy to disinfect (except those darn Legos ). We don't get to go to church about 50% of the time, or birthday parties etc. I have friends who's siblings or children have had cancer/transplants/other immunity suppressing diseases that we just can never be around. I'm worried for her health, the antibiotics, and the stress this brings to her and our family. Any input welcome and appreciated.\nShe's completely vaccinated.\nshe has no other signs of autism, so we don't think that's why she has problems with other kiddos.

If the canker sores are not in regions of flesh that you accidentally bit, then it could be a dietary allergy—especially since your sister is afflicted by something similar (though, the white line really might be benign; it's hard to tell without visual evidence). Did you both eat something similar, something with a lot of acid that could have afflicted the oral tissues? Any other symptoms like gastric pain, insomnia, itchiness?\n\nFor canker sores, rinsing often with Listerine antiseptic mouthwash has always helped me. There is a fantastic oral Chinese Medicine called Sanjin Watermelon Frost (Fu Fang Xi Gua Shan). The powder can be applied directly to the sores, and it helps the ulcer heal more quickly while reduces symptoms of local pain. It can also be used for sore throats.\n\nThe jaw pain is curious, and does warrant more investigation. Technically, the sores could be a manifestation of muscular tension, as the tightened muscles could impede the vascular and lymphatic flow, thus triggering obscure inflammation. Do you have symptoms of tight muscles in the anterior aspect of the neck? Have you had sinus pressure, headaches or hearing issues? What are the exact coordinates of the jaw pain? Left, right, or bilateral? Does it radiate? Have you had a fever or any other flu-like symptoms that coincided with this?\n\nEither way, if you fight tight or tender points along the neck, upper shoulder, and jaw, try massaging them to release the built-up tension. This should help to alleviate the symptoms.\n\nI hope this info is helpful to you, and that you're feeling better!\n\nJCM, L.

I also have had a constant ringing in that ear since. I do get ear ringing in that ear sometimes, usually right before a migraine, but never for more than a few minutes.

Remember the fall and severe pain in chest and the need to fall asleep.\nApproximately 15 minutes later a friend carried me to the car, I was able to speak normally, although slightly confused. About 5 minutes later I started feeling a severe pain in my clavicle, the pain worsened and a few minutes later the hearing in my right ear cut off completely.\nI was taken to the emergency room, it was concluded that I had broken my right clavicle. Paralysed and confused from the pain, I can’t recall if I mentioned the hearing problem. Whilst lying in the bed in the hospital, my right ear started bleeding. I had ruptured my ear drum. I also had a concussion and took me a while to recall what had happened.\nX-rays were taken of my shoulder and skull; the only evident broken bones were my right clavicle.\nI was released from the hospital, as I do not have a medical aid. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and vomiting in the backseat of the car. I had been drinking the night before and was given morphine.\nAt about 17h00 that day, I attempted to move from the car to the bed. I couldn’t balance on my own, and became severely nauseous when upright or moving.\nMy ear and back of my right shoulder were bruised, thus can be assumed that I fell directly on them.\nAfter 2 days the vertigo lessened significantly. I was able to walk slowly and by myself.\nI experienced and overwhelming sensation of tinnitus. To the extent that I struggled to hear in normal conditions, as it was so over powering.\nHearing didn’t return after a few weeks, went for an auditory test. The first ENT concluded that I had damaged the internal nerves. The second ENT had a different reason (I can’t recall). The same auditory test was done a few weeks later, but less of a distortion was heard. The audiologists didn’t think anything of this, and offered a cochlear implant.\nWeeks after the incident, and after being cleaned by more than one specialist, an audiologist noted blood on my eardrum.\nAbout 4 weeks after, for a few days, clear liquid uncontrollably expelled from my nose. I thought it to be sinuses, although I’d never experienced such problems. It was small amounts, but enough to need wiping away. It was completely clear and thin.\nWithin 6 weeks of the incident, I would hear loud noises in the right ear, but they would feel far away from the ear, as if the ear is hearing them, but not processing them as closely as it should. Sounds like drums, ie rather very loud.\nI was cleared to fly in that time. While the aeroplane was descending, I was asleep and woken up to an extremely loud pop/bang in the broken ear.\nAbout a week later, after taking a shower, I felt something discharging from my ear. An ear bud revealed a watery, bloody substance.\nI could hear very loud sounds, but they felt very far away and were not clear of perfect.\nRandom clicking/tapping noise would be heard in broken ear, over the sound of tinnitus, and not as constant. Especially when getting up.\nStrange tinnitus sounds were heard every now & again, a sound that sounded like something trying to connect.\nWhen I stood upright and held my head at a certain angle, the pressure in my broken ear would make me feel as if my head was going to explode, until I angled my head normally again.\nNovember 2016\nWhen touching my outer ear, the touch would trigger a shock to my tongue. At first it was subtle, but the feeling became more prominent and consistent.\nDecember 2016\nI blew my nose normally (and quite hard) for the first time since the incident and heard my ear ‘pop’ for the first time. Before this, there was no sound at all, nor do I recall a feeling of eardrum movement. In a clavicle related check-up in September, a GP claimed that my eardrum was moving normally, but looking back, I don’t think he made the correct diagnosis.\nWas driving long distances and ear felt like it wanted to equalise, sensation was slow, and didn’t feel relief. Felt like it went up to about 55%.\nJanuary 2017\nThe shocking tongue sensation lessened, but transformed into moving my tongue from side to side causes a feeling of movement inside of my broken ear. I have this sensation to this day.\nFebruary onwards\nFeeling the need to equalise often, but to no avail.\nPressure in head feels irritated, equalising eventually started working, but wasn’t always an optimal feeling. Mostly the pressure just felt better temporarily.\nAfter equalising, I am able to hear loud sounds as a distortion. The sound is similar to that of bicycle training wheels, I hear this distortion until I swallow, and then everything cuts off again.\nI started feeling a sharp pain in my ear and pain behind the bone of my ear.\nEar often felt wet inside and itchy.\nWhen pushing down on my tragus, sounds like it’s blocked and makes a wobbly echo at the end. Very loud and perfect sound, definitely not transferable over the skull to working ear.\nChewing sounds became very prominent, even in the broken ear.\nCould hear the water crashing to the floor in the shower, only certain sounds of, and sound felf far away, but still in the right ear.\nMoving my head from side to side quickly, it sounds as if there is water inside the broken ear.\nI started feeling like there is liquid running out of my ear, but it is completely dry.\nJuly 2017\nAs time progressed, my tinnitus lessened immeasurably. Today, at times, I can barely hear it and is not affected by fatigue or external noise, as it was fir the first few months.\nAn accidental loud shout in the broken ear, and accidental slap, on several occasions, both caused the overwhelming tinnitus that I had first experienced and lasted a few days.\nFound myself instinctively massaging the upper neck muscles on the right side.\nPhysical exercise made my ear feel like it needs to equalise.\nSeptember 2017\nI went to a loud music concert, the next day there was blood in right ear’s canal. I was working in a bar at the time, so loud music wasn’t something that I was completely estranged to, although this was louder than usual.\nDecember 2017\nWoke up to an extremely loud sound in ear. Like a bang or tear, its difficult to describe, but it was so loud that I lay still for a few minutes, scared to move as I thought I would break something.\nJanuary 2018\nCan now hear my finger scratching in my ear canal. Isolated and clear, no distortion.\nCan hear loud sounds like a blender, still not clear, but doesn’t feel as far away in skull as used to. Such loud sounds make my broken ear feel extremely uncomfortable afterwards. I start feeling sickly, as if I’m getting flu. The gland in my neck on the right side swells up and I feel like I’m getting a throat infection. This clears up after a few hours.\nFeels as if there is a baby hair in my ear.\nWas given a neck massage and heard movement in ear – as if there was waves/ water in ear and moving.\nFebruary 2018\nEqualised and for less than a second I could hear a “whole” sound – wasn’t distorted, and a lot closer than usual. Hasn’t happened again.\nWhen I get out of bed very quickly, my tinnitus disappears for a few seconds. As if trying to find balance. Only happens sometimes.\nAttended a ballet class and the jumps made my ear feel very uneasy.\n1/20 times will actually feel relief when equalising.\nMay 2018\nHearing bones creek in broken ear, eg neck.\nWas listening to music, softly, could converse normally, picked up certain sounds as whistle sensations in broken ear.\nEar doesn’t produce any wax at all when compared to working ear.\n\nTo this day I have done numerous auditory tests and seen 3 ENTs. None of them come to the same conclusion, nor have any interest in these strange symptoms. I don’t have a medical aid, so finding the right direction to go in has proved very challenging. After each hearing test, my tinnitus was excruciating.","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/53806/hearing-loss-and-various-prolonged-symptoms-after-head-trauma"},{"post":{"author":"ashton_55","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Persistent cough","post_content":"Long story short, freshman year I got really sick with I believe bronchitis, TBH when the dr told me what it was I was so out of it at the time I didn't pay attention to what it was but what I needed to take, ended up taking antibiotics for it and got better.

If I turned my head left or right it was like my vision was in stages. Like instead of smooth vision it was jumping. Real dizzy n light headed. Even vomiting with it. I had to pull over and have someone come get me. After an hour or so it passed but left a bad headache and extreme fatigue. I started having those episodes more and more frequently. It went from maybe once a month to a week to daily until it got so intense I couldn’t function. The “episodes” stopped but left me with a constant symptom. From the time I wake up till I go to bed I’m always dizzy, of balance and really fatigued. I’ve been to a neurologist who saw a spot on the back of my brain and said I either had a stroke or it was something I was born with. After further test he determined I was born with it and it was no concern. I’ve been to several ent’s. Ended up having surgery on both ears. Can’t remember technical term but basically had to have a bone graft in each ear to repair holes in the inner ears. Same surgery but two different procedures. This has been over the last year n a half. But still no fix. Now I’m constantly in a fog and still have strong episodes. I do good to go to work and come home just to lay down. Now I take klonopin daily. It doesn’t fix the problem. Just helps cope. I have had panic attacks from it. Multitudes of tests. But nothing to determin or fix the issue.

All indications are that I have an extremely rare ability (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability regarding smell.\n\nBefore you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell.\n\nIn my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up.\n\nAnd today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence.\n\nAt this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.\n\nSincerely Yours,\nRobert","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/51962/where-would-i-get-this-extraordinary-smelling-ability-tested"},{"post":{"author":"kayanow","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Lost hope with broken nose(post surgery) and major sinus issue","post_content":"Basically, the root of all my problems has always been my nose.

She had been using a nasal corticosteroid daily for the past 6 months as directed by her PMD. She added pseudoephedrine without relief of symptoms. Her symptoms became markedly worse on about day 4, with increased pressure and pain in her cheeks, increased nasal drainage, and worsening nighttime cough. There were no fever, facial redness or swelling, diplopia or other visual changes, epistaxis, chest pain, shortness of breath or pedal edema. She reported a mild sore throat and mild ear pressure, but no pain. She has a history of CAD and hypothyroidism, both stable and controlled with medication.

I finally decided to get it checked by urgent care because they seemed to be getting worse and I noticed my nose kept running.

They gave me the same ear drops but with instructions this time. I used them daily as well as Flonase and Zrytec. She said to do it for two months and if it doesn't get better, to go to an ENT specialist. The ear infection and runny nose have gone away.

The infection started to clear up and by the 10th and last day I only had the tiniest bit of pain if I manually wiggled my ear but all other symptoms gone.\n\nAbout 3 days later my symptoms started coming back. This time it wasn't focused in my ear but instead to the back of my neck and head. Headaches and shaking came back but I also started to find it hard to focus. Still no fever. The doctor gave me a Z Pack but told me to wait 3 days to take it cuz my ear looked fine and I didn't have a fever; that this could be a viral infection.\n\nI waited but only got worse so I took the Z pack and noticed really quick improvements. I swear I could feel it fizzing inside of my face, jaw, and back of my head. But again, by the time I took the last pill it seemed that I was on the verge of getting fully cured, just the tiniest of pain on the back of my head.\n\nI felt fine for maybe 5 days but then the cycle started again. Severe headaches, stiff neck so bad that I couldn't rest my head on my pillow to sleep, I had to sleep in a seated position. Again it was hard to focus and I would have some confusion. Twice I went to my car and opened the passenger's side door instead of driver's side. I went to call out from work and I forgot what I was doing, then when I remembered, I forgot how to do it. This happened fri night and I didn't get to the doctor till monday and by then miraculously I had already started to feel better...not great but now at my worst. Again I was told that it was probably a virus and that it's on it's way out. That was two days ago. The feeling of being sick never went away but I felt..ok, until now. Headache is back, pains, and shivering as I type this but still, no fever at all. 98 temp.\n\nIdk what to do anymore, I just feel that I need to be on antibiotics for longer than a week but with no visible sign of infection I feel like I'm going to be told to go home and wait it out again. Tomorrow will be 2 months with the only days I felt normal was towards the end of antibiotics. I'm worried that it might be meningitis but that seems to be more sudden than my prolonged infection. Idk. Any advice of what to do or what tests to asks for would be great.","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/51291/ear-infection-spread-to-my-face-head-and-won-t-go-away-help"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"I’m not sure what’s going on I could really use some help","post_content":"My left side of my throat has gotten really tight around the muscle.

I am a 15 yr old female and my main problem is a fullness/popped/clogged feeling that has been happening in only my left ear multiple times a day for sometimes hours and hours at a time for three months. Nothing else is wrong with interior of my ear; no pain, ringing, etc just a feeling of fullness. I went to my pediatrician about a month ago regarding these little hard pea sized bumps growing in my ear lobe under the skin. I was referred to an ENT who said it was blocked oil glands and nothing to worry about so i briefly mentioned the popping and he said it was nothing to worry about also. A couple weeks ago when looking up what i could have, some symptons of mine were related to cancer but i knew it was rare, but can happen so i checked my lymph nodes first and found that i have a slightly swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck (posterior cervical) which is a little longer than the lenght of a quarter and witdth of a finger nail. I also noticed one the shape of a pea directly under it. And on that same side of neck at the bottom of my ear i noticed a hard pea size lump last night that grew rapidly. So worried that one side of my head has an ear that continues to pop with \"blocked oil gland cyst\" on it and the other side of my head has swollen lymph nodes i told my mom to book a doctors appointment for today. MY doctor looked in my ear and said she saw nothing abnormal and said that it was also normal for lymphnodes to swell, she diagnosed me with fluid in my ear which she thinks it is and prescribed me with 3 alllergy medicines for two weeks to see if it helps and if not i go to the ENT again to see about ETD. I feel like I am being overlooked or that i just worked myself up over nothing. I havent been sick in forever and have no infection so i dont know why my lymphnode has been swollen.

Towards the end of our trip, she developed a cold, which I caught two days later. Up to a couple of days ago, I was exhibiting normal cold-like symptoms: lightly scratchy sore throat, mild cough, and sinus congestion. I was given an over-the-counter medication in France that is similar to Mucinex, and I've been taking that for about six days.\n\nUpon my arrival home four days ago, I was feeling much better but noticed that the congestion had moved to my ears and seemingly stagnated. Yesterday I woke up with mild balance issues and vertigo. I went about my day normally, but was nauseous by the end of the day.\n\nLate last night, I quickly developed chills that got worse over time. Thinking I probably had a fever, I took my temperature and was shocked to see that it was 96.3 degrees. I was slowly getting colder. I immediately put un multiple layers of clothing and a heavy blanket and was able to get myself back into the 98 degree range after about four hours.\n\nMy questions are these: Could my sudden drop in temperature be related to my cold and possible inner-ear issues? If not, what could it have been caused by?

I checked my throat then and noticed a little white stuff growing on my tonsils, very similar to that of strep. Told my family, but since it wasn’t not a lot, and they could not see it, they presumed I was crazy. Went to the doctor for other medical reasons, brought it up to her, she waved it off as a sinus infection - never thoroughly checked. I went back shortly after still not feeling well, she gave me a strep and mono test, both negative. Went to the ER for other health problems, mentioned my throat there (and by this point there was quite A LOT of white patches on my tonsils, specifically my right - it would then spread to my left). Doctor there said it was an upper respiratory infection and told me to keep gargling salt water (also tested for strep - came back negative). So I did...and it got worse...and worse. I tried this TelADoc thing through my insurance and sent a picture of my throat to the doctor who would be calling me. Right off the bat he said it was strep and sent 500mh amoxicillin to my pharmacy. That did NOT help, ended up getting worse. Made another doctors appointment at urgent care, they tested for strep, negative as well. But this time he prescribed me azithromycin, 500mg for 5 days. While it has definitely helped my throat a bit, my left ear still has a bit of pain. I just took the third pill today. The right side of my throat feels perfectly fine, it’s a little sore when I rub it. But my left is still a little more tender, a little pain when i swallow, and my ear. My question is, although this medicine does appear to be working (the pain I had before it was unbearable, it felt like I was swallowing glass), should I go back to an ENT? I just want to know what exactly caused this. I’m very hygienic when it comes to my mouth, seriously - like brush, floss, 10 times a day hygienic. I was reading up about some other things it could be, and I was wondering if anyone else ever had these symptoms? The white patches in the back of my throat have definitely decreased in size, but that Is partially because I took a q tip and said I had enough and started scraping it off. It did bleed very little, in only certain areas, so I stopped. I called the doctor back and he said the 500mg for 5 days should definitely knock whatever’s in my system, but I just wanna know exactly what IT is...anyone had anything similar to this?

I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say anxiety, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I've told him and haven't been referred to anyone for it. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.\n\nSymptoms:\nWhen I bend over forward or tilt my head too far (other triggers too see below) my eyes become red and burn, vision a little blurred. I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving jelly in my head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are \"grabbing\" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point.\nAlso when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related.\n\nSymptom Triggers:\nSome are stronger than others. If I bend over and it triggers the symptoms, that can last all day. Other triggers don't make it last as long.\nPushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing.\n-----\nNow years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica, except from what I've read Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.\n\nBefore all of this when I was in 7th grade I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I was taken to a small clinic up in the mountains and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long. Maybe that has something to do with part of it such as the epilepsy like symptoms? Cranial damage which makes my head not feel solid? When I tilt my head I feel unequal pressure in my head depending on how I tilt it. I didn't feel these symptoms after hitting my head, only after I blew air hard into my head about a year later.","like_count":"0","tags":["Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/48786/injury---i-blew-air-extremely-hard-into-my-head-with-my-nose-mouth-and-ears-covered"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Smelling smoke after ive lost my sense of smell.","post_content":"I feel like im in a cloud of cigarette smoke all the time.

I had it intermittently for over 30 years until a doctor put me on a medication for another condition ten years ago and it's been constant and progressively louder ever since. Stopping the medication didn't help. I have high frequency hearing loss with loss in speech discrimination. My world is never quiet unless I'm sleeping. Here's what I've learned.\n\n1. Some medications will worsen the noise. I don't know if switching any possible offending meds will make any difference, it didn't for me, but it may be worth a try. Always ask your doctor before they prescribe any new medication if tinnitus is a side effect, then ask the pharmacist before you accept the medication because they know more than doctors. You don't want the noise to get louder, so always ask.\n2. Having noise in the background gives your ears something more pleasant to focus on - music, TV, fan, white noise machine. Make a conscious effort to focus on the background noise. Falling asleep with a fan running is helpful.\n3. If you're having difficulty hearing over the tinnitus, you may want to see if you qualify for hearing aids. Not being able to hear can feel very isolating. There are hearing aids where you can turn on and off white noise or other noises to help mask tinnitus, although that feature does interfere somewhat with your hearing, it is nice for quiet times or certain environments.\n4. Keep your mind off of it as much as you can, focus on other things, keep busy. I can't focus on reading but I can focus on numbers so I'll do number puzzles like sudoku when I sit down at the end of the day.\n5. Don't put swabs in your ears as they can damage your inner ear follicles making tinnitus worse.\n6. Protect your ears around loud noises - lawn mowers, power tools, concerts - wear hearing protection or ear plugs as loud noises will worsen tinnitus.\n7. Tinnitus can cause anxiety. If you find this to be your case, try guided imagery meditation. It can help calm the mind despite the noise. I find this type of meditation easier to focus on. Free on youtube.\n\nThere's nothing you can do to make the noise go away, but you can find ways to cope with it and prevent it from worsening. I hope my suggestions were of some benefit to you.

I was living my life, having fun. On New Year’s Eve, I started experiencing an odd ache behind my ear, along the skull. I immediately told my mother about it and she took me to the doctors, they brushed it off and said it was a normal migraine and that it would go away eventually. The pain never went away. I started getting very bad jaw aches, to the point where I’d start crying. I went to my dentist, they said it was normal and for two years straight they recommended me to do jaw excercizes and such. I thought it was foolish because it had to be more than that. I eventually complained about it again and my mom took me to another dentist, they took my wisdom teeth out saying that was the root of the pain, the pain actually subsided for two-three months but it eventually came back. I told them once again and they told me to take pain killers. During all of this, my jaw pops and clicks and when I eat something rough, my hearing becomes foggy and things become inaudible. On top of all of this I was also hearing a ringing in my ears and it’s been 2 YEARS of this unbearable ringing, everywhere I go I hear it. One day I started experiencing vertigo symptoms, I was sobbing for 9 days straight, it lasted 9 days but went away. I went to the doctors the day my vertigo started, they told me to drink water because I was dehydrated, I did drink water during the time being but it didn’t go away until 9 days after. I am very scared that it comes back again and my doctors always seem to brush these things off and blame it on anxiety. I am not going to lie that I have very bad anxiety but this anxiety and depression started ever since I started getting those symptoms. My life has never been the same, I’m constantly paranoid at the doctors and my mental health is deteriorating along with these horrible symptoms. I love living my life and I just want to be normal again.","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"jay12082","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Any help; Appreciate it :)","resp_content":"Ps.

This caused some minor depression because the symptoms are lowering my quality of life. I began to have constant light headedness. At which point I was told that I have 70% weakness in my left ear on top of the Patulous Eustachian Tube.

When I described my symptoms he said it might be a retinal tear so they took photos of my retinas and did ultrasounds on my eyes, but didn't find anything. I still felt like my eyes were bothering me but now in the form of occasional blurry vision and increased floaters, but I thought it was probably just in my head. I suffer from anxiety and have been sure I had something terrible going on when it was really nothing before, but it's been under control and that hasn't happened for the last 3-4 years. A few weeks ago I had what I think was another ocular migraine with no headache, because I didn't want to go back to the doctor for nothing and did some research on my own, and again the symptoms were identical. A few days later I started having pain in the upper corner of my left eye socket when I looked up, which is normally is the start of sinus issues for me. That lasted a couple of days then went away. About the same time I started having intense episodes of fatigue and feelings of muscle weakness in my arms and legs (mostly my knees felt weak), and I noticed my hands tremble frequently. I also feel like I was have trouble concentrating and feel very out-of-it at times. I again explained it all away as anxiety as I've had those symptoms before when my anxiety flared up. I wrote it off as not getting enough sleep and putting in new floors which caused a lot of knee-bending that I'm not used to. But I finally went to my doctor because in the past those symptoms have always gone away within a few hours once the anxiety passed. But now I'm starting to worry because they've lasted for a few weeks. These symptoms also feel a lot more intense than what I felt during past anxiety. I went to my regular doctor and had a hard time describing what was going on because I didn't take the time before hand to sort it out and write it down. He ended up checking my vitals and looking in my ears. He found fluid behind my ear drums and said that one looked discolored, a grayish color. He said that I have a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics. I haven't taken them because I don't really have any symptoms of a sinus infection other than the brief headache that has been gone for weeks and I really don't want to take antibiotics for nothing. I'm hoping someone can tell me if the symptoms I described really are common for a sinus infection, and that could be what's going on even with no stuffy nose, no post nasal drip, and no sensation of pressure. Or should I try to get a second opinion?

It's been causing me sleep issues and is constantly there to remind me when I turn around to talk to someone or look up at the sky. 3 months after the symptom started, I did a throat swab, I had a ultrasound on my throat, blood tests, T3 and T4 hormone tests for my thyroid, a nasaendoscopy and all came back for negative for anything that I was being tested for. And most finaly, a gastroscopy. I was found to have gastritis and an ulcer on my stomach, and was prescribed medication. It was thought that my acid was iritattitng my throat. But my throat discomfort stayed the same, I've had abolutely no change to my throat symptom, even after completing my medication course a couple of days ago. I'm starting to simply accept this as something I made up, but the discomfort is so strong, that I find it extremely difficult to lay down with my hand on my head, or basicaly in an laying down position.

The main thing is that her nose is awfully congested and runny (if she leans back, you can see how filled and overflowing it is). She also has a minor wet cough, but that is much more manageable.\n\nBy now we have figured out quite the \"system\" - since she needs to blow her nose every 2-10 minutes (no joke), she has packs of tissues in her desk and bag at school, there are boxes all over my house, and at dance, she makes sure there is always a box in the studio she's dancing in. But she is very uncomfortable. And now as she's becoming a more competitive dancer, competitions have been very difficult for us (for her solo, she was blowing her nose until she went on stage and I was ready with a tissue backstage for when she came off) and we are still too scared to send her to a convention. And it doesn't help that she can't breathe through her nose, so she gets out of breath so quickly. \n\nWe can't really travel with her or even go on day trips because of this. When we went on a ski trip, she skied one day, constantly stopping on the hill for tissues and water (her throat gets so dry because of her heavy mouth breathing) and she came home with the messiest face mask and jacket I've ever seen. She didn't ski another day. And when we went to Florida, she was in the room for most of the day because she couldn't really swim. And car/plane rides are miserable.  \n\nThe coping mechanisms we've developed so far, besides keeping tissues handy at all times, have been a) we do a sinus rinse every few days (haven't found this to be helpful) b) she does nasal spray five times a day (7, 11, 2:30, 6 or 7, before bed) which we have found to be helpful, but you're supposed to clear your nose before which she can't really do.. c) she will occasionally take a decongestant. Her nose is also so red and raw from blowing it like 2 or 3 hundred times a day so we put stuff on it for her whenever she needs it. And she has an inhaler for when her cough is bad. \n\nWe've gone to our doctor and some specialists and the only answer they've had has been that it is very severe nonallergic rhinitis and that something is causing her mucus to rapidly overproduce (I know, gross!). They say surgery couldn't help because it's not about her adenoids or anything like that.\n\nSo, do you guys have any ideas of what could be causing this or any ideas for some more coping mechanisms to help?

So now what? Saw an ent and again got nothing and he does not seemed concerned about it, but said we can laser it off if does not go away but is painfull surgery.

Anxiety and hormones?","post_content":"I'm a 28 year old woman currently having difficulty with ETD in both ears. I was first diagnosed four years ago, and the etd cleared up after 6+ months. Between then and now I have had ETD flare ups almost every year, some lasting several weeks, some lasting over 6 months. In fact, my ears are never 100% fixed; 90% maybe, but i always have mild symptoms that don't affect my daily life too much, until i have another flare up and then it is debilitating. I feel nauseated, (have vomited on the rare occasions when it has been very bad), feel off-balance, feel like i am constantly going up and down like on a boat, feel sudden rushes like i am falling (this disturbs my sleep), have brain fog, fatigue, feel very anxious and on the verge of tears. All those symptoms subside when the pressure in my ears subsides. The doctors do nothing except give me steroid nasal spray and say to wait it out, but the spray does nothing even when taken for months, and i have etd so often that i spend 6 months at a time debilitated by it. It is not just a bit of ear pressure and hearing noises. I have noticed that my monthly cycle affects it too, symptoms being worse before my period starts. I have read online that hormones can affect the eustachian tube, and am wondering if it is possible that a hormonal imbalance is the cause of these reoccurring and chronic etd problems? I have also read that thyroid disorders can cause etd but this is little known. I do not seem to have other symptoms of thyroid issues nor hormonal imbalance but has anyone else noticed a connection? I have not had my blood tested for such things and am not sure an nhs dr would even consider the possibility. I know that allergies can be a cause but i begin suffering in the winter months, not spring or summer, and do not have a blocked nose or watery eyes. Would it be worth asking a dr to be tested for allergies?\n\nAlso, has anyone found coping mechanisms for the emotional symptoms etd can cause? Would anxiety meds help? I am not sure if they would since the anxiety is directly associated with the ear pressure and movement symptoms.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated. I would really like to find a cause for this since it happens so frequently. I cannot find a reason for the flare ups, i do not have a cold before it starts. The first time i had etd it began with a virus, and perhaps it has damaged the eustachian tubes.

It started usually at night, the pain was intolerable so my mom would take me to the emergency room where they always punctured/pierced my ear drum. The procedure was very painful but it relieved the pain almost immediately.\nThis was recurring at least once a year until I was about 14yo. At that age, I started to experience hearing loss. I went to see a doctor but after checking my ear he told me that everything looks fine. So I just continued with my life until the hearing loss became so severe that I couldn't even hear the teachers at school. I went back to the doctor explaining my situation. After looking in my ear again he apologized for not noticing it the last time and told me I have a different kind of infection \"infection of sekrets\" ?sinusitis? and recommended me to an ear specialist supposedly top of his field. The new doctor confirmed the diagnose and scheduled me for a procedure/surgery where I laid down the nurse would hold my head very tight to avoid any movement and the doctor would again pierce my ear drum but this time left the needle there and connected something like a vacuum cleaner to it and sucked the ?puss? out and inserted gromets ?myringotomy?. This was even more painful than the previous procedures and left me very light headed after. However, my hearing went back to normal immediately after. This again recurred at least once a year for both ears.\nAbout 3 years ago when I was 24 I asked him if the condition is ever going to go away or if I'll have to undergo this procedure yearly all my life. He sent me to get a CT scan and after the result came told me I have some \"dead tissue\" in my head/ear and recommended a surgery. When I asked him what the surgery was he explained that they would have to cut a little triangle out of my skull behind my ear end insert tubes that would stick out of my head for about 3 weeks during which I would have to stay in the hospital. He also told me that the procedure is extremely painful and that there is no guarantee it will help. Also, the side effects were very scary like loss of taste, paralysis and even death. So I declined the surgery and started looking for a new specialist.\nI then found a private clinic (very expensive) with hitec equipment. The doctor there found that my \"nose tonsils\" ?adenoids? are severely overgrown and that they are pressing against my eustachian tube, therefore, preventing drainage. So he scheduled me for a surgery to remove the ?adenoids? and also ?myringotomy?. This time everything was done with lasers and I was under anesthesia.\nIt has been about 2 years since the surgery and it all looked fine until about a month ago when I started to notice that I'm starting to lose hearing in my left ear again but it doesn't come close to what it used to be.\nI have been living in California for the past 18 months and currently don't have health insurance because I can't afford it yet but will get it soon.\n(btw several doctors recommended that it would help to move to a warm/tropical country)\n\nSo my question is what kind of procedures would American medicine recommend? Cost? If I grew up here would the doctors here proceed the same way or do something differently?\n\nP.S.

I work in the cold, and we park in a garage that you can taste the dust on your tongue. Not great. I recently got the flu and developed a cough. It was dry for awhile, but I was prescribed prednisone and I have been taking mucinex with it to break it up. I had already taken off a week of work from the flu and couldn’t afford to do another week, so I had to ask for the steroids. The past two days have been the worst with me picking up slack working by myself and 20+ hours. So far the medication has been working, however I feel like it’s a never ending need to cough. Before the steroid and after, I’ve had clear/white phlegm. Very thin, and feels like I didn’t get anything. However when I get big chunks they’re gray/black or brown. Cough is productive since medication, but I have a pain in my right chest under the nipple and the lateral chest when I breathe or cough so I feel I cannot cough fully. I looked up meanings of phlegm color and the only thing with white, black, and brown is pneumoconiosis. My gf is a nursing student, and listened to my airways and thinks I need bronchial dilation. That correlates with pneumoconiosis. My Dr’s nurse said my chest pain muscle spasms, but it feels in between the rib cage which would be arthritic. My family has a history of arthritis and I currently am undiagnosed but have chronic pain. Pneumoconiosis and arthritis lead to Caplan’s syndrome. Both are non curable and grounds for a lawsuit.

It happens every day, and typically lasts between 5 minutes and sometime up to an hour. The volume she spits up can sometimes be as much as half a cup. It is very red and liquidy and is definitely blood (its been tested).\n\nShe has had extensive workups at 2 leading hospitals that has included: multiple overnight admits; tons of lab work (all fine), an angiogram (all fine), 2 ENT scopes, dentist (all fine); consults with a multi-disciplined team (ENT, gastro, pulmonary, neurology, hematology, etc.) They appear to have ruled out soooo many things, but the daily spitting up of bloody saliva continues despite all of this. Her ENT recently even cauterized some suspect blood vessels (talangatasias, sp?) in her throat thinking they might be the source. Even thought she might have HTT, which was ruled out via labs.\n\nHer labs are all good, never any temps, eats great, sleeps great, well-adjusted girl otherwise. Never any blood in stool and does not appear to be coming from stomach (never resembles ground coffee , and is not acidic at all per lab testing).\n\nShe's been tested for so much, and so much has been ruled out, but the daily bouts of spitting up the blood continue. Not a ton of blood in the spit up as she never gets anemic. Also, there is never a cough associated with this, and her lungs are clear as a bell.\n\nAll the leading docs are saying is that they can take another look via scope to see if they missed anything.\n\nTo find the source of the blood and end this is the goal.

It's on both sides in the the same area but it hurts worse on the left side. My face is literally swollen, but I seem to be the only one who notices, but I can definitely tell, my parents don't see it but I think it's just because it's slowly swelled over such a long period of time. I can't even begin to describe how uncomfortable it is, it even affects my jaw movement and my jaw muscles also It's also made my jawline swell, so it looks like I almost don't have a jawline, which I definitely did before, and its not because ive gained weight, ive actually lost weight. Whatever this condition is it has ruined my life. I don't really have dry mouth or any discharge into my mouth. It honestly feels like they are lymph nodes or something. And right next to my lips like an inch away you can see my pulse, it's like my lips are swollen too, like not my lips per se but the area around my lips. I've been to like 4 different doctors..none of them believe me or anything,they all just think I have a fat face and it's in my head...like wtf, the pain is not in my head, neither are the lumps that are palpable, none of the doctors actually feel for them, because they don't believe a condition like this exists. I've been to an ent and she sent me in for a biopsy because a ton of my submandibular lymph nodes are swollen. But it came back as reactive? So she's just given up...I have no quality of life anymore, I just stay in because smiling or moving my face at all is super painful. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I've lost all my friends because no one understands...heck I don't understand! The ent wouldn't even feel my cheeks for the lumps that I'm talking about, all of the doctors I've been to have been clueless about this. I had a ct scan done and it didn't show anything but it has to be wrong because the lumps are palpably swollen. It doesn't hurt worse when I suck on lemon candy or sour foods. I just don't know what to do. I'm going to get a few minor cavities filled in hopes that that will cure this. But none of my teeth hurt, and I really doubt it's that. The pain is so bad I've thought of suicide. The doctors refuse to treat my pain even when I'm sitting there telling them it hurts so bad I've thought of suicide. I feel like the medical system has given up on me. It really sucks because I'm only 18 and I feel like my life has been ruined by this. Im just so tired of this.

Otic migraines can also be caused by too much salt in the diet, low blood sugar or a lack of sleep\n\nI am now on a Migraine diet to avoid trigger that cause my attack.\n\n3-TMJ (temporomandibular joint syndrome) I will need to get a face massage done.\n\n\n\nI got the tympanostomy done and it was hell. The results were disastrous. I immediately had a major reduction in my ability to hear. Bass sounds were gone and low level ambient sounds were also gone. In fact my ears felt more plugged than ever and everything sounded like I was under water. Having conversations was a chore as people had to repeat themselves to me. My own voice sounded like I was hearing myself with a bad cold and not like it was coming in through the air. Sounds like I'm underwater. When I speak, I can only hear my voice in my head, as it does when you put your fingers in both ears to speak. I cannot hear my voice 'from the outside'. Feels like my right ear is completely plugged! Everything was muffled\n\n\n\nIS THIS MY NEW REALITY? I am at the end of my ropes. Sometimes I do want to kill myself. I don't know if i can deal with this for the rest of my life. I want to be normal again. Please God help me or someone. I am having an attack right now while I am writing this.","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"fullears","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Atypical Meniere's Diagnosis — Is This My New Reality.

I was shaking, had a cold prickley sensation all over my body, Increased heart rate, and a fever of 102F.\n\nDuring my time in the ER they ran every test that they could think of, including testing my urine, bloodwork, giving me an ultrasound of the heart, and a CT scan of my upper body. However, none of the tests revealed any sign of infection and i was sent home a day and a half later.\n\n2 Weeks had passed since my first ER visist with no noticable issues, until one day when I was just sitting down watching youtube my heart started racing for no discernable reason. Again I was taken to the ER, and when I got there my heart rate was at around 140bpm. They put an Iv in my arm and pumped me with Saline, and about a half an hour later my heart rate was back to normal again and I was sent home that same night.\n\nAfter my second ER visit I went in to see my family doctor, and he reffered me to see a Cardiologist. The Cardiologist put me on a holter monitor for 24 hours and had me do a stress test, wich both revealed nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nA couple of weeks went by, during wich I felt relatively normal until one day when I woke up my eyes felt like they were burning, and my vision had become fuzzy. I went to go sit down at my computer, and found it difficult to look at the screen because the light would hurt my eyes.\n\nI went in to see an Optomologist and they had me do a bunch of tests. They found nothing out of the ordinary besides my Astigmatism (wich I already knew I had) and perscribed me a new pair of glasses.\n\nThe new glasses arrived about a week later and improved my overall vision, but I was still experiencing the sensitivity to light and some fuzziness in my sight. To further complicate matters, around this time I started to feel a sensation of Dizziness...like I was moving although I was physically sitting still. It also became increasingly difficult for me to concentrate and think clearly.\n\nI went into the family doctor again, and they reccomended that I have an MRI and CT scan done of my brain just to rule out anything serious. About week later, my insurance approved the scan and the results came back normal for both scans. My brain was apparently \"unremarkable\" and normal for someone of my age (26).\n\nThe sensitivity to light dissipated in time, but the vertigo did not. I was also still having difficulty concentrating, and a high-pitched ringing began to develop in both of my ears, so this time the family doctor reccomended that I see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat Doctor).\n\nThe ENT determined that I have an Acute Sinus Infection, and perscribed me antibiotics to take for 10 days. I am 9 days in, and the dizziness has almost gone away entirely, however I do still notice it when I sit down and when I concentrate on objects. I start to feel wobbley and uneven. The ringing is still there as well, but has gone from being high pitched and intolerable to a sort of low \"hum\".\n\nI am sorry for the extremely long post, but I felt it important to give my full background from when I first started noticing a problem upto where I am now. These past few months have been really bad for me, and I just want to find out what could be happening. i have been to multiple doctors, multiple experts, and had many different tests done...but really am no closer to understanding what is going on. I would love to think that this was all just some bacterial infection that has been working it's way through my system and that the antibiotics are now flushing out but I just dont know, and that is what is most scary.","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems","Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/34078/vertigo-head-congestion-disorientation-trouble-concentrating-difficulty-thinking"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Cold(s) , Pains & Nosebleeds","post_content":"Hey guys, I'm in real need of some advice.

Going into a cold climate (cold room) after a hot shower.\nI've been told that having a hot shower then going into a cold area, such as; a cold room or outside (10°C) will twist my tongue or shift it to a side. Going from hot air into cold air is bad overall. Is this true? Is it harmful in anyway?\n\n2. Not wearing a jacket will have some negative long term effects on my body.\nI am in a habit of not really getting myself warm enough in a chilly weather. I would sleep with a thin blanket and thin clothes, I would get outside where it's 10-8°C with thin clothes, I don't really use much of heating devices even though my family can't live without them, & I am kind of making my body adapt to low temperatures. My questions are; Am I harming my body? Are there any long term effects? Should I continue what I'm doing?\n\n3. I don't feel low temperatures as much as other people.\nI would start wearing jackets a month after everyone around me does, I don't use heaters as I previously stated, and I would not get cold as much as others do. Is this normal?\n\n4. Getting into cold areas will result in the flu/common cold.\nIs this true? I did my research and from what I understood is that low temperatures would result in a decrease in efficiency of the immune system, which would allow the flu virus to infect the body. Am i right? Can I get sick from being in a cold environment (without a virus)?\n\n5. What happens to the lungs when they shift air temperatures quickly?\nFor example; moving from heated car to a 0-3°C weather, or vise versa\nWill any thing happen to my lungs?\n\n6. What happens to my skin when I shift temperatures instantly?\nfor example; Ending a hot shower with cold water (to reduce acne).\n\nIf it is no trouble, I would like someone (professional/doctor) to answer these questions.\nThank you for your time :)","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/32634/are-these-facts-about-cold-tempretures-true"},{"post":{"author":"threeboxes","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Swollen gland?","post_content":"For the past week, I've had swelling on the right side of my throat, under my jaw.

So once again i went back to the dentist to see what could be causing the pain, he took more x rays and unfortunately still couldn’t find any cavities or infections.

Part of this misdiagnosis (what I believe it to be anyway), could be partly due to me not relaying as much information as I could, as I felt the doctor seemed rather rushed.\nSlight hearing loss was noticed on the morning of 2/13; the day after I started wearing my new pair of headphones and sound equipment. I did not think they were causing much damage as it wasn’t really much louder than my old setup but I did feel pressure and itchiness (both outside and inside the ear), I think this is because the low frequencies were much more pronounced. For the following week, buzzing in my ears started to get worse and I eventually began to feel a little fluid in my ear. I was then prescribed prednisone on 2/21; slowly hearing came back slightly until 3/2, where I felt 70% of my hearing had returned.\nHowever one very significant problem remained, and one in which I feel I cannot articulate effectively. It doesn’t feel like my eardrums vibrate much at all. I don’t think this is a very accurate description though, the lack of sensation I’m getting is when you go to a concert or listen to bass accentuated music, there is that noticeably pleasant vibration you get. I’ve always considered this sort of the texture or layered part of music.\nMy audiogram displayed ‘Normal Hearing’, though it feels far from it. I have scoured the internet and I have only read of one somewhat similar case (their cause way unknown).\nI ran into this case again 3/16 just six hours from my ENT visit. Same audio setup, although at very low volume this time around with significant ringing unlike the first time. Ringing stopped a couple days later (but the hum from the first incident has remained). I just started another prednisone prescription after going to urgent care on 3/20.\n\nAny Help would be greatly appreciated!\n-AJ","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"echo117","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Ear Doesn't Vibrate As Much?","resp_content":"Just to add, to an already lengthy post.\n\nSymptoms now are:\n-Slight hearing loss in both ears more so in the Left (noticeable to me, but I’m sure would still end up around the normal limits of hearing.\n-Slightly full ears (constant urge to pop them)\n-Nausea (I’m sure it’s unrelated)\n- Low frequency hearing loss (below 70hz)\n\nIt’s frustrating to not know whether this is noise induced (seems like it was pressure related), or something else entirely.

I had the worst headaches I've ever experienced along with terrible back and neck pain. I eventually developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. All of this I believe was due to lack of sleep, the lack of sleep was caused by my tonsils covering about 90% of my throat. I had done four or five rounds of antibiotics, several blood tests for deficiencies and mono etc. One morning I woke up with ear pain and the right side of my face was swollen and saggy, I was put on another round of antibiotics and had a nasal spray and a pain killer for a sinus infection. I was put on a waiting list to see an ENT specialist but he said \"my tonsils are large but there is no reason for him to remove them because a tonsillectomy is one of the worst surgeries..\". Finally all the pain had gone away but 1 tonsil has remained swollen for over a year now, I now have to dig tonsil stones out regularly and when I remove them they bleed, I feel no pain though but I really wish I was able to get them removed.

Or, for that matter, his sexual preferences. That said, it's bothering you, so it's worth checking if there may be a cause to your voice not being as deep as you'd like. The only time male hormones, like testosterone, would be a good idea is if you actually have lower than normal levels of testosterone. The only way to know is to get your level checked by a doctor. If you have normal hair distribution, normal sexual function etc chances are your hormone levels are just fine. And so are you. There's no surgical procedure to be done to deepen your voice. You're very young and I know something like a higher pitched voice can be quite traumatic, especially if people say things. But just know that one day, your voice will just be your voice and you won't be bothered by it. With age will come that confidence. Just be you and try not to be bothered by people who don't appreciate you. I understand. Not easy ... I don't have a particularly deep voice either. And yes, that used to bother me. But the funny thing now is that people actually tell me how nice my voice is (and I often think .. really?!) . Perhaps it got deeper with age or I'm just more confident in who I am today. And you will be too one day. Work on it and be happy with you.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/27309/voice-depth"},{"post":{"author":"uppers","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Ear Infections","post_content":"Hi,\n\nI quite often get ear infections, generally when I get them wet many times in a row, like on holiday.\nRecently I bought an Otoscope to reassure myself that my ears are ok and clear of infection to stop using cotton buds daily and poking fingers in them as they were always producing dead skin.\nThe last few days I have seen this brown forming on my left ear I did try a saline ear flushing and it seemed to dislodge it but it now has gone back to close to the ear drum.\nI have 2 picture 1 today (1) and 1 yesterday (3) after saline flush.\nWould be grateful of any advice as to what it is and how to proceed.\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nDavid\nAge 42 92kg 6'2\"","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/30606/ear-infections"},{"post":{"author":"yannity","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"throat feels weird","post_content":"I have a feeling in my throat like there are bumps or mucus in there when I swallow.

Colds are caused by many, many, many different kinds of viruses. For example, Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of colds and there are more than 100 different strains of this virus alone! Some viruses cause more cold infections during the fall and winter months. Most adults will have 2 or 3 colds a year.\n\nPeople can catch a cold by inhaling particles in the air from a cough or a sneeze, touching an infected person’s hands, or by touching surfaces that still have cold viruses on them. The virus can stay alive for several hours on surfaces.\n\nIt takes most people 1-2 weeks to recover from a cold.

It has been going on for at least 8 years and it's long overdue to finally do something about it. I constantly have phlegm in the back of my throat and it makes me uncomfortable. It's colorless. Whenever I spit it out or swallow it, it comes back in the matter of seconds. Naturally, it's the worst in the morning, when after a whole night I might spend a good 2 or 3 minutes just clearing my throat. Sometimes it hurts a bit when I speak for a longer period of time (it's not very painful but irritating). I need to use my voice as a public speaker. I always used to speak very clearly but now I’ve noticed that I have to make a conscious effort to pronounce my words correctly, because sometimes the nasal sounds come out somewhat “blurry”. Also it seems that there is too much saliva in my mouth. It’s not particularly noticeable when I’m not speaking, but when I do, I have to swallow more often then I used to.\n\nI have to blow my nose every few hours, especially in the morning. Everyday for the last few years I wake up with a stuffy nose. During the day it’s not a big issue but it’s still there. Even after I blow my nose I feel that I’m not breathing absolutely clearly. I’m not suffocating or anything, but I know that it’s not right. My nostrils feel heavy and tight, and the inhaled air dry and stiff.\n\nI should mention that I do suffer from seasonal allergies that intensify in the Summer, although I didn’t have them at all until 5 years ago (they came a few years after the phlegm). I do not take any prescribed medication for the allergies except some universal anti-allergy pills that you can get from your local drugstore (and they don’t work at all) and an asthma inhaler.\n\nI’m in a good physical shape, I play sports from time to time. I don’t smoke, rarely drink. My diet is probably not the best. I’m not fat but sometimes I forget to eat vegetables and stuff.\n\nBased on all of this, could you tell me what do you think about my condition?\n\nI would prefer to try some natural remedy first and see if it works, before I take prescription meds.\nThanks","like_count":"0","tags":["Throat Problems","Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/28109/phlegm-constantly-in-the-back-of-my-throat-have-to-blow-my-nose-too"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Ear problem","post_content":"Im 18 years old i went and scratched my ear open because i got a painful pain inside of my ear canal so i went and cleaned it with cotton wool but i scratched my ear and my ear started bleeding and since then i can't hear properly trought my left ear its been 3 days now and no improvement it feels like its swollen like theres a big bump blocking on the inside of my ear canal and blocking my hearing .

I am male, early 40s, generally very healthy. I suffer daily from nasal and facial pain, usually starting in the left side of my nose and progressing to the left side of my face. Right side is never affected. The pain starts every day when I enter the air-conditioned office at work, but can also be triggered by pollutants such as smoke. The pain diminishes when I leave the office, but does not disappear entirely.\nSome history: Until about 20 years ago I never had any nasal problems. And then I had a cold, followed by sinusitis which caused stinging pain below both eyes - I think maxillary sinus area. After a week or so, the pain on the right side disappeared, but the pain on the left persisted. This did eventually stop, but I then had a period of about 3 years with regular sharp pain in the inside corner of my left eye (lacrimal sac / lower ethmoid sinus area). Antibiotics had no effect, and nasal endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Eventually the pain went away, but reappeared intermittently for short spells triggered (I think) by dry or smoky air. Not sure if it's relevant, but I also suffer from hayfever in the summer (and have always done so). No other allergies that I'm aware of.\nAnd then about 3 years ago, I moved to a new (sealed and air-conditioned) office at work. Within 15 minutes of entering the room for the first time, I began to get the familiar pain in the left side of my nose, and during the day the pain spread across my face. I have since moved to another office, but the problem persists. The pain often diminishes overnight when I am sleeping, but returns the next day.\nOne thing I have noticed is that the skin between the corner of my left eye and my nose (where the pain first originated) seems to protrude very slightly. If I hold my nostrils closed and inhale, the skin gets sucked inwards to become the same as it is around the other eye. Similarly if I breathe out with my nostrils closed, that area swells. The effect is small but perceptible, and is left-side only.\nI have had another nasal endoscopy, which again revealed nothing abnormal. I have tried antihistamines and beconase nasal spray (beclometasone dipropionate), and also a capsaicin (pepper) spray. Steam inhalation and massage of the area may help very slightly. I have been on low dose amitriptyline for pain management for the last couple of years. The amitriptyline I think helps a bit. I use a pure saline nasal spray every hour or so at work, which definitely helps somewhat in the short-term, particularly with a prolonged spray action and holding my head upside down. The only time I have no pain at all is if I have a heavy cold with runny nose - this miraculously causes all symptoms to disappear, however it does cause a bit of postnasal drip when sleeping, such that I wake up coughing.\nI'd be grateful for any opinions or advice! I'm also unsure whether top of nose/corner of eye falls under ENT or opthalmology.","like_count":"0","tags":["Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/26460/nasal-and-facial-pain"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"What's in the back of my throat.","post_content":"In may, I was extremely sick due to black mold poisoning, and allergies to cats while living with 4.

I had very minor flu symptoms. At this time, I noticed my right lymph node was swollen, but painless. I self-medicated and took a course of Cipro. A week later, I saw my family doctor who was acting as my OB/GYN. He noted that both of my lymph nodes were swollen. My flu was gone. I no longer had pregnancy symptoms. He didn't offer any explanation or treatment. 5 days later I had a traumatic miscarriage. It was extremely painful and bloody. I had my first appointment with the Maternal Fetal doctor a few days later. She could not determine the reason for the miscarriage. She discovered I was anemic from the blood loss during the miscarriage and prescribed me Iron. I didn't see my family doctor until July 24th because his office scheduled me the wrong day in June and couldn't get me in until July 24-- yeah, they still thought I was in the middle of a troubled pregnancy (3 prior miscarriages during the previous 12 months) when they didn't promptly reschedule me. On July 24, my lymph nodes in my neck were even larger. When I turn my neck, they 'pop' with a movement as my neck 'innards' move to make room for them. I told my family doctor. He told me he had no idea and would have to ask a more knowledgeable doctor and get back to me. He said he'd recheck my iron levels and call me. No one called me, so I called the nurse and the receptionist told me it must be fine or someone would have called me. On August 25, I saw my family doctor. My lymph nodes were still huge. He told me he forgot to ask another doctor and would get back to me next month about it. In the meantime, he noted my Iron levels in July were still only at a 9, so he told me to keep taking the Iron supplements and he'd call another doctor to ask about my lymph nodes and he'd call me about my iron levels. That was his only treatment for me. He took blood for my iron level but no other testing was done. The next day, the nurse called me about my iron levels from July. I told her I'd already seen the doctor in the meantime, so she called me a month too late. (smh).\nObviously my doctor and his support staff are incompetent. It took the nurse 5 weeks to send my records to the maternal fetal clinic so they'd see me, even though the doctor said I was at such high risk that I needed to be seen immediately. I miscarried before the nurse even sent my paper work in, despite me calling every day.\nI live in a very remote location and this is my ONLY option for a doctor. I'm 43.

It lasts for days and sometimes weeks. Once I went to the GP about it, but they didn't know. I don't have ear problems, nor excess wax and normally my ears are okay (they sometimes get blocked for hours and hours after swimming with water caught inside them - I think I've sorted that one by putting in soapy water to break the surface tension of the trapped water). It is just when I reduce the calories and also exercise; it's both ears. I think it might be something to do with pressure in the Eustachian tubes, but don't know why or how. When it happens I'm normally feeling weaker from lack of calories. Swallowing doesn't help. It will come back to normal when I eat again (after a while). I wondered: 1) is it harmful to me, i.e. does it matter?; 2) I am just curious to know what's happening. I'm guessing there's not much I can do to stop it (other than not fasting, but I do fast sometimes). I think it gets worse the longer I fast / restrict calories to less than I need a day.

Cartilage doesn't have good blood perfusion, which reduces healing and increases infection risk. Having said that, she was being over-cautious. If you have hoops put in when the piercing is done, and clean them rigorously, you should be fine. Use more than saline, however... Use a cottonball with hydrogen peroxide, and twirl the hoop so the H3O gets into the pierce. THEN rub a tiny bit of the generic triple antibiotic ointment on the hoop and twirl it into the pierce as well.

But for me (I am not a doctor nor anything like a doctor, but this is what I do, and it works for me), and many other people in the world, I put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in one ear, while I lay on my side, keeping said ear level to allow the peroxide to do its thing. You should stay on your side for a few minutes, like three, then sit up with a tissue pressed against your ear to clean up any remaining peroxide. You should not use any q tips or objects to clean in the ear, just rub the tissue on the ear to clean up. Then repeat on the other ear. This will not remove all of your ear wax, and should be done once every few days or once a week. Don't let your ear wax build up! I don't know the specifics of how it works but you will hear little crackling noises, from the peroxide reacting to the ear wax.\nOR, because you said you have soft ear wax, you could even rinse it out in the shower. Just let some warm water from the shower into your ear, (if you're shower pressure is interchangeable, do not do it on a high pressure setting) let it rinse you're inner ear out for as long as you'd like, and repeat on the other side. This is safe to do during every shower, as long as it is not painful or uncomfortable for you.\nRemember, q tips do not belong in your ear, nor do other objects. Also, built up ear wax takes time to be removed and once removed, need regular up keep to avoid it from happening again. You should still consult your doctor to see what is recommended, and do not be afraid to tell them what works and doesn't work, and they have the instruments to look deep inside your ear to make sure it's healthy, so continue to check in with them.\n"},{"author":"aam30","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Ear wax build up","resp_content":"Go to the ENT.

You MUST make an appointment with your doctor (not dentist) for this specific thing. They will be able to give you medication, or will lead you through through the process to solving this, which could mean having your tonsils removed. A build up of tonsil stones can cause pain and I think relates to bronchitis/strep throat. But tonsils main function is to prevent germs/infection from getting down your throat and causing illnesses. So people who have their tonsils removed are at a greater risk for getting sick. But there are upsides to removing your tonsils, depending on the person, tonsil stones can be extremely annoying and painful if not dealt with. And tonsil stones will not come back if your tonsils are removed (but if they did it would be like a minuscule amount) So please, make an appointment with your physician, you cannot handle this problem on your own, as the stones will just return.\nBut the way I know how to remove the stones, is that I use (I don't recommend this and I'm not a doctor, please be careful when doing this, and do not push to hard) a pair of tweezers (washed+sanitized) but not the pinching end, flip it around (hold it by the pinching end) and use that dull end to push on the part of my tonsils closet to my cheek and with the other hand (complicated I know) I use a q tip to sort of squeeze my tonsil as if I'm trying to lightly pop it like a zit. The real key to removing difficult stones is to put pressure on two parts of it, one part is not enough. Another tip is to continuously poke it and rub the tonsil (all lightly), as just one long push on it isn't enough to wriggle the stones out.

I am just examining common advice that states ´wear a jacket dont get cold´.\n\nWhat always bothered me is what happened really when we are exposed to cold and our temperature drops. Why would we get sick ? Is it that our immune system gets weaker and it is time for bacteria to step up? If that is true is it bacteria that are already in the air or inside us? If we would lower our temperature in a controlled sterilized environment we can stay at lower temperature for very long times without getting sick?\nDoes this also mean (if true) that we are talking about bacteria right? But the flu is a virus correct? so we can get it from others only (unless it is also inside us already).\n\nToo many questions I know, but most of them are rhetorical. The main question is whether the above is true or not. Is it a matter of rates? At normal body temperature there is a certain bacteria growth that we can always fight but when we go to lower Ts the bacteria rate increases and our system gets weaker so the numbers go up in terms of bacteria? If that, could we say there is a threshold to reach before we get really sick ?\n(we all have felt almost ill but managed to overcome it before going down with it).\n\nThe effects of the above could be local I suppose from what I have seen. When I was younger I got a very bad case of throat illness (dont know the name) and now I am sensitive.\nIf I drink e.g. cold water fast the next day I will have a problem and if I dont pay attention it will evolve and I will get throat-sick needing antibiotics to get well. That has to be bacteria right?\n(believe me I tried avoiding them but if I dont take them I am finished withing 4 days).\nThis happens once per two years but I have noticed that it seems to migrate. Starts from throat and when it retreats it goes to lungs (softer) to ears and then nose. So here is the second part of my question. Can a bacterial\ncondition evolve and migrate ? Is that possible or am I getting sicker catching different kinds of bacteria or viruses from the environment (while I am a little weak due to the initial condition).\n\nIs any of the above true for bacteria (and/or viruses)? Are they inside us and they are temperature dependent with an optimum growth at lower Ts? (that would make sense as fever is breaking this anomaly and we are supposed to warm up our body).\n\nThank you very much for reading. Looking forward to any tips and answers.\n\nBest regards,\nNikolaos","like_count":"0","tags":["Cold","Throat Problems","Flu","Nasal Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"edwardoleander","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Mechanism of getting sick","resp_content":"Hello Nikolaos,\nThere is no complete answer for you, unfortunately. Only recently has a study with mice found any evidence that cooler core temps have any actual effect on the immune system. I was taught it was old wives tale. At cooler temps, however, it was discovered in the mice that immune system proteins called interferons do not function as well, or respond as vigorously. So far, only airborne viruses have been studied in the mice. There are no corresponding human studies that I could find.

He stopped what he was doing numerous times in order to try to regather himself, as he complained of feeling like the whole room around him was spinning. He was able to proceed with undressing, showering, & getting dressed for the show, but by the end of this process did agree with us that he needed to be taken to the ER. Just prior to getting into the car to go, he did feel thirsty, took a drink of water, and vomited within a matter of seconds. Even after vomiting, he complained of feeling nauseous. He also complained of feeling like his right ear was badly blocked, had a loud ringing noise in it, and he really couldn't hear much at all with that ear. He said his left ear felt only a little blocked & he could hear pretty well with it.\nWhen we arrived (around 6:30 pm.), theER nurse & physician's assistant examined my father and took him for a CT scan (based upon the signs/symptoms he told of and they witnessed, they didn't think he'd had a stroke, but wanted to rule out anything of the sort). Shortly after the CT scan was performed, the PA can in to tell us it looked perfectly normal and they were diagnosing him w/an inner ear infection/vertigo. They sent him home w/prescriptions for ear drops, as well as for pills to suppress the nausea & dizziness. As it turned out, he never did need to take any more pills for his nausea (they gave him 1 in the ER) and from Thursday (Aug. 3) until today (Aug. 7), he stopped taking the pills to lessen the dizziness (this morning our family dr. recommended he resume taking them).\nThen, the day after my father's visit to the ER, he still felt very dizzy (although he began describing the sensation as being more like on a very rocky cruise ship, as opposed to the whole room spinning) and was extremely tired, as he slept for much of the day.\nThe next day, my mother & I took him to our family dr., who prescribed a lower dose of the medication for dizziness (the pills he resumed today) & instructed him to continue using the ear drops. During this visit, my father told our dr. of all of the symptoms I've mention previously, but he also said both sides of his head (mostly in the area of his temples) felt blocked and like he had some minimal mucous running down the back of his throat.\nThen, after not seeing much (if any) improvement at all by Wed., my father called the family dr., who then recommended he see a ENT specialist.\nThe next day (Aug. 3), we drove my dad to the ENT's office. The ENT examined his ears, reported seeing no signs of blockage nor infection and gave him a hearing test, after which he confirmed the pretty noticeable hearing deficit in the right ear & normal hearing in the left. He told my mother & father it's possible the auditory nerve in the right ear \"just shorted out\", in which case the hearing's not very likely to return & balance may continue to be an issue. W/that said, he did also give my dad prescriptions for a \"Z-Pack\", steroid, & another large blue pill that's supposed to knock out both viral & bacterial infections. He told him to come back in 1 week.\nIn the meantime, now in his 5th day of taking these prescribed meds., my father still feels his right ear is pretty blocked and has ringing in it (although both of these things did ease a bit for much of Saturday & this morning, but otherwise returned & remained fairly constant). He also still feels pretty of balance when walking (still like e's on a rocky ship), although he did also see some improvement on Sat., only to have much of it return yesterday & today. . . . He also describes it as feeling like he's having trouble focusing w/his eyes, especially when he first starts walking, but says it does improve a little once he takes a few steps. Much of the hearing deficit is still present in his right ear. He also says he still feels some pressure in both of his temples, though it's the most improved symptom.\nFinally, I should mention that on July 10 my father did complain of cold-like symptoms, but they were completely gone by the next day w/o an medication. He has also had a history of sinus infections in the past & often sneezes a lot (especially when he 1st wakes up in the morning during spring, summer, & fall). However, he's had no history at all of vertigo/dizziness prior to July 29. So w/all of this said and the fact he really had no warning signs of any of this, but has been experiencing these frightening symptoms for the last 10 days w/only marginal improvement since he began the meds prescribed by the ENT specialist, I'm concerned he may not ever really get better (although today our family dr. did seem extremely certain he will make a full recovery, as he strongly believes it's just a bad case of labyrinthitis (not a dead auditory nerve nor Meniere's Disease).

Eventually one ER provided a homebrewed \"gastro\" solution of lidocaine and antacid that seemed, after several hours, to help.\n\nEver since then after multiple visits to ENTs and gasto doctors, as well as having two CT scans and an endoscopy, the discomfort/pain in the back of the throat persists and hardly improves. The burning is gone but the constant pain and discomfort continue.

The ENT read the radiology report of the last CT scan (with contrast) and said \"everything is fine\".\n\nThis is frustrating to me because clearly not everything is fine! The throat pain continues to worsen and the lymph nodes are not going down in size. When i asked for specifics he said they were \"less than 1.5 cm\". Which presumably is the threshold for biopsy. Both nodes are swollen, and painful, which i guess? is a good sign. He recommended only coming back when i get \"night sweats\" and \"significant weight loss\"; ie, clear signs of cancer.

A CT scan ruled out any other cause of the vertigo. I was given a prescription for meclizine 12.5 mg, which I have not had to use again until a few weeks ago.\n\nAspergillus sinusitis: for 12 years have been on immune suppressors - currently infusions of Rituxan - for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The meds compromise my disease resistance enough that 6 years ago I developed aspergillus sinusitis in the right maxilliary sinus. After surgery to remove as much of the fungus as possible & alter nasal passages to help discourage infection, my condition greatly improved. Subsequently treat symptoms w/ an off-label prescription of Budesonide steroid in a nasal rinse.\n\nBPPV: a few weeks ago, I had another sudden violent episode of BPPV, accompanied by sinus pressure on the left side of my forehead, which took a few days to resolve, using the 12.5mg meclizine pills.\n\nMost unusually, awoke this morning to another acute BPPV attack. The Eppley maneuver seemed to make symptoms worse, so took 25mg meclizine. But the violent symptoms persisted for more than 2 hours, even the eye movements didn't start to lessen until 2.5 hours. Also distinctly stopped up sinuses on the left side. Just used Budesonide rinse in hope of loosening up, because still can't do any normal tasks w/out nausea.\n\nBecause my immunity is compromised by recent Rituxan treatment, I have been concerned that these new conditions might signal a change in my aspergillosis. When I called my ENT's office to ask for an appt or @ least a call-back so I could ask the doc some questions, the receptionist refused both, insisting that the 2 conditions are \"completely unrelated\" & stating that my request was inappropriate because he had never treated me for BPPV.\n\nAm I nuts to think that the two problems might be related? The ear & sinus are both part of the same system, even connected by the eustachian tube, right? Is there a way I can circumvent the appointment desk \"guardian\"?

(*however i had never gotten a cold, or sore throat before the pain started, and i never had any tonsil pain during the earache?*) She gave me Amoxiclav, vitamin C & otipax ear drops. I took all of the above for a week however none of them eased my pain or improved my hearing.\nOne week later my earache went away however my hearing didn't go back to normal (and hasn't gone ever since).\nI'm guessing my eardrum has perforated by the possible ear infection i got.\nI should also mention that the day before I went out after taking a shower (with wet hair) so that might've also had an effect, dunno.\nMy hearing loss started 1-2 days after my earache . At first it was kinda severe but then i guess it got better. Now I think I've lost about 30-40% of my hearing. I also started having constant tinnitus (almost every day). It's not bad but sometimes it tends to get annoying. (I think I'm also supposed to hear a popping sound by now but idk, when i yawn (or fake it) i hear some kind of pop/crack, not sure how to describe it; does that count?)\nI don't really have a problem with following group or phone conversations. I may get a bit confused in noisy places but I've always had this so it's not my ear's fault XD\nI have yet to see an ENT, since I was waiting for it to heal itself. I will tell my parents ASAP and go check it out properly. I really don't want to have surgery at this age, and i don't particurlarly trust the doctors in my country. I hope i can get a paper patch or whatever it's called if the hole's not big. I'm really worried at this point since I really want my hearing to improve. I don't wanna make my parents worry cause we're also going on holiday and I know I can't swim in the condition I am.\n\nIf anyone's had a similar case to mine, how long did it take for it to heal?

Though I don’t know all of the details of your story, I hope that this information may be of some use to you as you work with your doctor to treat your sinus congestion.\n\nThere are several causes of long-term (more than 12 weeks) nasal congestion. Allergies to house dust, pollen, mold or something else in your environment are a common reason. Other cause can be deviated nasal septum (the wall in between your nostrils), nasal polyps (growths in your nasal passages), or infections. When symptoms last this long, we recommend following up with a doctor who can help understand the reason for your symptoms, so that you can get the right treatment.\n\nThough over-the-counter medicines like antihistamines and short-term use of decongestants can sometimes help, the best option to decrease the congestion is usually a nasal corticosteroid. Flushing out your nasal passages, as you are doing, is also important. Nasal corticosteroid sprays help prevent and treat the inflammation. If the sprays are not effective, your doctor might recommend rinsing with a saline solution mixed with drops of a corticosteroid.\n\nThe problem with long-term use of decongestant nasal sprays is that your body will need more and more spray to improve the congestion (and after using the spray too many days in a row, you might actually have more trouble breathing clearly after you stop using it – this is called “rebound congestion”).\n\nAlong with seeing a doctor and talking about diagnosis and treatment options, try these remedies: make sure you get plenty of rest, sleep with your head elevated, drink plenty of fluids, avoid cigarette smoke, breathe in humidified air (turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom to breathe in the steam), and try warm compresses on your nose and cheeks.\n\nI hope you can breathe clearly soon!\n"},{"author":"fastcars","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Severe sinus congestion","resp_content":"Try fenugreek!

It almost feels like the cord at the back of my eye has been strangled or something. The pressures in my ears feel very unusual, and I have been experiencing ETD (where your ears crackle when you swallow). The area behind my right ear is tender, and it appears somewhat red, although it is not swollen. My fear is that the strep came back and caused an ear infection which is now progressing to mastoiditis. However, my family doctor checked my ears this past Friday and he said nothing appeared wrong with my ears, and I asked him to do a strep screening which came back negative.

I do not believe I have been screened for Cystic Fibrosis, as my birth was extremely early, and at that point in time I wouldn't have been able to produce enough sweat for a proper sweat test. Once as an infant I stopped breathing and the doctors couldn't figure out why I had stopped. (I have no more information of this event, only what my parents have recalled to me.)\n\nI have been coughing up phlegm regularly now, for as long as I can remember. However, it has gotten worse within the last few years, to the point where I have to cough it up almost every day, and sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes, when I cough up this phlegm, it has traces of blood in it, however it is never enough to be considered alarming or to the point where I think there might be something damaged in my lungs or airway. I tend to cough up more during or immediately after I exercise, and if left un-dealt with, can even cause me to go into a long coughing fit. I overheat constantly, am almost always dehydrated, and for the most part, underweight despite my considerably healthy diet and constant exercise. I am prone to getting sick, and I am constantly congested despite whether I am sick or not. This happens all year, every year, but gets worse during the summer when I overheat far more, inhale more pollen (allergies), and exercise more. This has gotten so bad, in fact, that I now normally have to stay inside, and even then I still feel the effects almost constantly. I have yellow-tinted skin, which has only appeared within the last seven years or so, and often my skin is rather salty (or at least I assume, considering my dog licks my arms so much).\n\nI have tried bringing my concerns up with my mother, however she continues to insist that it is normal to cough up phlegm as often as I do. I insisted that certainly it couldn't be normal to cough up phlegm with traces of blood, however she continued to insist that it was normal, and that she does too have a similar problem at times. My parents do want what is best for me and care for me deeply, however they continue to insist that this is not a large problem. I respect and trust them, however I felt that I should get an opinion from a medical professional. My parents are always present when I am at my doctor's appointments, so I have had no opportunity to mention my worries with my doctor. I have very little of my own money, and if these sweat tests really do cost over two hundred dollars, that would be quite a bit of money for me. I want to at least go to a doctor when I have had the opinion of someone who at least knows a LITTLE about what I might be dealing with. Which leads me here, because quite frankly, I am out of options.

I have cystic fibrosis and I was diagnosed with it recently because I couldn't be tested when I was born because in England it wasn't a 'problem' so they didn't test you, but you do have very similar symptoms to me, and, depending on your age, you should be able to see the doctor on your own. If you can't see the doctor on your own, then do talk to your parents about it but DO mention that cystic fibrosis is VERY serious and is not to be half-heartedly treated or dismissed. Also mention that if you have any sort of symptoms of cystic fibrosis, then you should always seek medical advice from a doctor as soon as possible. My parents took me (I'm 15) only after a couple of months of coughing. You probably will be diagnosed with asthma but if symptoms persist and aren't helped by the inhaler you are given after two weeks go back to the doctor and explain what's wrong and they will either send you for testing (unlikely) or give you another inhaler (more likely.) If symptoms do persist after two weeks go back to your doctor and say what's wrong again and if they send you for testing then that's definitely a good thing but if they give you a stronger inhaler just see if symptoms persist and if they do then go back to the doctor because I went round the block a few times before they sent me for testing. Eventually you will get this sorted, and don't think you won't because you will. Trust me, doctors hate seeing patients suffer. I hope you get things sorted, it should take between 6-12 months.

I attend many music concerts and have/am been around loud music but I've always been cautious about plugging up my ears in some way the majority of the time (maybe not just a couple of times throughout the years) I have never experienced tinnitus and have recently gotten my hearing checked and everything checked out and this ear evidently was STRONGER than my left.\nI have visited an ENT many times over the past 6 months and he is not sure what is causing it. At first we considered an ear infection but it only occurs during said situations. When he looks into my ear he sees nothing wrong and the eardrum is working properly. There was significant wax build up before but he removed it (although during the right ear cleaning it was very painful). This feeling does not happen when I listen to music without headphones, but it will happen if I listen to music in a car (Ill notice a pressure release if I lower the windows), and if I'm at a loud show close to a speaker. It has gotten to the point where if I am at a show even if I have my ears plugged the vibrations of the frequencies will cause the ear to act up again. Even worse of course if they are not plugged. The last show I went to really did a number on my ear and the pinching/irritated/swelling feeling lasted for almost a week after (but without ringing or hearing loss)\nOnce again, I am having NO ringing and NO noticeable hearing loss. My ENT wants to do a CT scan but I cannot afford this nor do I want the radiation exposure. Once the feeling subsides, as long as I don't irritate it it will go away until exposed to close frequencies again. I should also note that when I try to pop my ears, the problem right ear will delay in popping. I am not sure what to do here and am feeling at a loss with this. Any ideas or suggestions?

In November 2015 after a house party I drove home with a littile hangover, mindig my own busieness at home, when -while smoking- I got a rush, seizure or I don't know how to express. I felt hot in my body, got dizzy and very weak and my heart beat strangely. I layed down on my bed to get a rest, but it wouldn't go away until the evening and I felt that something is not good - to say the least. So -given that it was Saturday I guess- I went to the doctor (GP) on duty. She sent me home that it is just from the booze and I should get a rest.. she adviced me some vitamin B6. So I went home but it wouldn't get any better. Or just slightly. On Monday I went to my doctor who sent me to a cardiologyst and nothing was found. I can't recall precisely but I think after a week I went out with my girlfriend to have some food. While eating another 'seizure' came. At that point I literally felt that I'm going to faint. We went to the hospital to have myself chekced. They found nothing. They did another EKG and some blood tests, and I have been sent home to take some B6 yet again.\n\nFast forward to Jan or Feb 2016. Sunday lunch with family. Again a 'seizure' (sorry I don't know a better word). I've had enough. Went to my doctor again, told her that I want myself checked out thoroughly. Within a span of few months I had a more detailed blood test (TSH), chest X-ray, head CT, head MRI, I've been to an ophthalmologist, a ENT doctor, neurolgist. This last one suggested that maybe I have panic attacks, so I should see a psychologist. I did. And I don't have panic illnes. At least back then I hadn't..\n\nOh I forgot the main problem I went into so much details.. Vertigo. Almost constantly. It affects my life in so many aspects. Sometimes it gives me a hard time to do my job (IT sysadmin in a school). I can't enjoy life as I used to. Can't play basketball, can't drink alcohol (or very rarely, as it amplifies the vertigo). etc..\n\nSo the ENT doctor told me that there is this 'Vertigo test' (again rough translation). They put a device on my eyes (like a VR googles) which has a tiny camera in it which records my eye movement as I am in complete dark. After this they pour water in my ears (googles off) which should make me very dizzy in under 30 secs. Again, I don't remember exactly but my left ear worked properly, I became very dizzy. The right one was complete numb. The girl had been pouring water into my ear (which flows out of it of course) for like 2 mins and nothing. Doctor gave me pills (here called Nootropil and Betarevin) to take them. Took them for months, nothing changed. He also showed me an exercise to do regularly. Got back to him they did this test again. None of my ears would react..\n\nPresent. The ENT - sorry this guy is a otoneurologist- doc sent me to a rheumatologist. Now I am recieving massage, and I will attend physiotherapy for my neck that maybe this causes the problems. The ENT doc -in my opinion- has no clue what is the root problem and seems like he doesn't care.\n\nSo here I am after a year and a half, living my life on like 50% when I should live it to the max :) And still no cure in sight.\n\nI hope I didn't leave out anything from the story..\n\nDan","like_count":"0","tags":["Ear Problems"]},"responses":[{"author":"oredanaa","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Vertigo","resp_content":"Yes I forgot something.

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued.\nPosted 12 days ago\nLooking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink.\n\nI've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.\n\nNow back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.\n\nI'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports on labyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse.

I sure hope someone out there can point me in the right direction. I'm 35, and all my life I've been very active and agile, and I've had great coordination and balance. Over the past few years (maybe 4-5?) I've noticed that my tendency toward car sickness has increased, to the point that I usually avoid being a passenger if at all possible, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary and I didn't think much of it.\n\nAbout 8-9 months ago I started dancing (salsa, etc), and I really fell in love with it. When I began to devote regular time to practicing, and attempted to apply proper technique to my turns, I found that keeping my balance was nearly impossible. At first I thought I just needed more practice, and I'm sure I do, but the more turns I practiced in any one session, the worse I became, to the point that I would have to catch myself on walls and furniture in order not to fall. I feel so unbalanced - like my brain thinks that the floor is somewhere other than where it is. This is always accompanied by a sensation of terrible motion sickness and nausea, which sometimes lasts for hours. Now that I'm aware of it, I notice it more. Any time I change the position of my head quickly, I get very dizzy. Someone gave me an exercise ball for Christmas, and I tried sitting on it at my desk. Within seconds I was nauseous from the slight rocking motion, and I had to stop using it immediately.\n\nThe other part of the story is that my ears feel...weird. One thing that may be important is that I've been sleeping with OTC ear plugs almost every night for the past 4-5 years. Whether that is related to any of this, I have no idea. As to my ears...I have the sensation that there is fluid in them, often. When I use q-tips to get the water out of them after a shower (please don't lecture me about this; I am very careful), if I press the q-tip gently to the wall of the ear canal, there is a sensation of pressure changing that is really hard to describe - the way it feels when you have water in your ears, before the pressure seal pops. But this sensation feels deeper, and it is always there when I insert a q-tip and move it around...it is like a wall of pressure and it alters as I move the q-tip, but it never disappears - like fluid deep inside my ear that won't budge. I don't know if that made sense, but I definitely did not feel this sense of fluid in the past. Occasionally my right ear will hurt mildly when I blow my nose, for a few days at a time. Then it stops. And then there are bizarre occurrences now and then - like the last time I was in the ocean, I wiped out with a surfboard and got tossed around a bit, and when I came out of the water and I was so dizzy I could barely walk. My head felt completely full of water, and my ears squealed and trumpeted like crazy when I blew my nose. This lasted for quite a while, and the dizziness/motion sickness lasted the rest of the day.\n\nI saw a primary care doc a few months ago, and her examination of my ears was unremarkable, which surprised me, because they really feel like they have too much fluid in them, or something. She referred me to an ENT specialist, and I ended up canceling my appointment, as I really couldn't afford it at the time, and I had a sinking feeling it was going to be another unproductive visit. I started taking ginkgo about 3 months ago after reading an article about its positive effects on circulation and vertigo in some people, and I do think it's helped my circulation but I don't think it's done much of anything for my balance. Other than that, I'm just trying to be careful not to make myself nauseous. I can do all the things I need to do for work, etc, without any trouble, and if I didn't love dancing so much I would probably be ignoring this issue.

One day, I noticed that my right ear was feeling a little stuffy. I had some hearing loss and I could hear my voice kind of echo in the back of my ear. Then I noticed that occasionally my hearing would get more sensitive, so I held my nose and blew air into my ear and it popped. A lot. It popped like a machine gun (is the only way I can think to describe it). Then, once I had finished blowing air in, it popped like that again even though I wasn't trying to pop it. I would end up having to pop it several times before it would stop. Even after it stopped, only minutes later it would need to be popped like that again. After days of dealing with this, I went to the doctor and he told me that I had fluid build up behind my eardrum that wasn't draining. He said that there was no wax at all (like I had originally thought there might be). He called it something, but I don't remember what exactly he said. He recommended me some over the counter medicine and gave me a steroid shot to help. My ear didn't pop like that for 2 or 3 days afterwards, but today it started acting up again. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've been taking the medicine like I'm supposed to, but it hasn't been working. I thought the shot helped for a while, but I guess it didn't. I haven't had any pain, but it's getting very bothersome. I've had to wear an earplug in that ear all day so that it won't bother me.

Sounds in general have a metallic after-sound, that is, when people talk (for example) their word (especially those that contain t's and s's) come with almost like a symbol of a drum set sound and makes it slightly painful.\nIn both my ears I sometimes hear something like chimes going of or like hundreds of birds chirping at once or the sound of cicadas in the summer.\nAlso in both my ears, though I think moreso my right, common sounds have a ring/whistle to them. For example, from inside my house, the sound of gardeners mowing the lawn I can still hear that sound, but it comes along with another high-pitched ring to it. Another example is my bathroom fan or when I flush the toilet and it fills up with water; I hear the normal fan and water refil sound, but I hear a high-pitched ring/whistle along with it. It's as if my brain is adding extra sounds when not necessary.\n\nThis is been going on for a week and I'm crying hysterically.

I'm a 26 year old female, non smoker. I have these lumps on the sides of the back of my throat. My breath is just awful, and I started getting tonsil stones about two years ago. I occasionally have difficulty swallowing with a post nasal drip feeling, and that's been going on for 4 years or so. I also get heart burn regularly. I have lightly swollen lymph nodes in my neck that go down in size when i take antacids regularly.\n\nThere's too many lumps to just be tonsils: at least two on each side. Roughly the same size as tonsils. I would include pictures but I'm not sure how.\n\nMy primary care provider says they're from anxiety (which i do have anxiety problems but that connection seemed weird to me). She sent me to an ENT to be safe who swears it's an allergy reaction. He had me get immunotherapy shots for half a year which did nothing but cost a lot of money. I'm also a little suspicious of him, since this guy has dozens of people getting allergy shots every day (and that's not an exaggeration, i counted roughly 24 in the 30 minutes i waited for my shots).\n\nAnyway, i don't feel like I'm being taken seriously. I'm hoping if i go to my ENT with an educated guess, he'll stop treating me for allergies and look for another solution.\n\nThank you for your time.","like_count":"0","tags":["Throat Problems"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/6334/lumps-in-throat-next-to-tonsils"},{"post":{"author":"melissajc82","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"clogged ear for most of my life!","post_content":"Since I was a child I've had a feeling that my right ear is clogged and I can't hear well out of it.

HELP!!","post_content":"Hello all, this is a long story but I’ll try and make it short. So about 5 days ago, I started experiencing hearing issues in my right ear, in that everything sounded distorted. I am studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan and went to a Japanese ear and nose doctor. The first time he couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear and I passed the sound test (the one with the headphones and silent room). He removed a large amount of earwax and thought that was the issue. Two days later the issue persisted and I went back to the same doctor. He checked my ear and I did the sound test again, nothing could be found wrong with my ears.\nIt was at this point the main subject of this post begins. At this point, (yesterday, during the second appointment) he proceeded to do something I have not been able to even research about on the internet. He stuck a long, very thin, metal tube up my nose. This was accompanied by him blowing air through said tube. This was very painful, but the stranger thing is what happened next. While blowing air through, he sort of ‘connected’ his ear and my ear with a tube (maybe he was listening for something or using vacuum pressure??). The tube was maybe 2.5 feet long, and had fittings at each end that were made for ears. After said task was completed he still couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear, and thought maybe my hearing issue was caused by stress. He prescribed me some medicine (which I haven’t taken, seemed sketchy as they were “stress lowering pills”). Anyways my nose/nasal cavity was sore afterwards for the rest of the day. I am awake at 6:00AM now and my nasal cavity is a lot sorer, it feels like the pain in the onset of a sore throat.\nWhat should I do? Go to another hospital for this new nasal injury? Can it heal on its own? Moreover, has anyone even heard of a doctor doing something like this before? Any help is greatly appreciated, I feel scared right now.

My hearing has been a bit muffled and there's still a constant ringing in my ears almost 24 hours after the show. My hearing has noticeably improved (although it's still not as great as it once was), but the ringing doesn't seem to be subsiding much, if at all. I'm getting worried as this is something that I've never had to deal with before. Should I see a doctor about this?

I am desperate to figure out what is wrong with me. Ive had head ct scans and mris done and all come back normal. All of my symptoms began with a diagnosis at the VA of swimmers ear, ear infection and upper respiratory infection. I was given Flonase and antibiotics . It seemed as if I was getting better but after the 10 days of being on antibiotics. I was having the headaches still along with ear pain. I have been suffering with these tension like headaches and ear pain for 3 months. I took a ct in and a mri in December a sinus ct in January and In February I took a second ct with contrast and noticed a posterior lymph node swollen to 9mm. Again I took a 10 day course of even stronger antibiotics (Augentin 875) to knock out the infection found on the ct scan of the lymph node. When I was on this course of antibiotics I became very fatigued there were days I would sleep for 15 hours. I got a yeast infection from the meds as well as I feel like I now have a bladder infection. I have too many symptoms going on and I cant get a dr to help guide me to at least figure out why I am having these daily headaches and ear pain. I have crusting in my nose. I believe the lymph node swelling is from a scalp infection but a hair strand test pulled from a dermatlogists read negative. There were small pimples in my head and I did have a lot of itching when all of this started. I have been washing my hair with ketoconazole shampoo DAILY and this seems to have helped with the itching. My hair is very dry though. The pimples on my head still remain. This is weird for me because I havent had acne since I was 18 Im 33 and all of this acne appeared when I started getting sick. My dr wants me to take a mri of my neck with contrast tomorrow. I am worried that all of these scans with contrast is damaging me. My dr wants me to schedule another ct scan with contrast of my neck to see if we should biopsy the lymph node. These headaches and fatigue I am having is ridiculous. I just would like to know if someone can review my blood work or tell me some more tests that I could request that might possible show what the heck is wrong with me. I think I still have some weird ear infection but I have been to 4 diferent ents and they all say that there is no fluid behind the ear and no infection present.

When I was younger, (toddler age) I got frequent ear infections that my doctor said would go away as I got older. I also had highly sensitive ears. I stopped getting them almost completely as I got into school age. Now, when I turned 16, things got bad again. I started with a minor ear infection and was treated with, I believe, Zithromax. This gave me some bad symptoms/ side effects. Being the naïve young self I am, I stopped taking this medication too early because my ear pain was gone and the side effects were almost unbearable. The following month, I got another ear infection. I tried telling myself it was just a little pain that would fade, but it got worse. I ended up at the urgent care again. They prescribed another medication. I did take it, but the prescription made my heart race, and I was constantly sweating so much I couldn't even think about my ear pain. As usual, the pain wore off , but I ended up with another the next few months. I eventually was sent to an ENT, where they examined my ears. They told me the pain was due to my allergies, and they ran an allergy test where they found I was allergic to many, many things. I ended up receiving an Epipen that I have to carry around everywhere. Now, I am having more ear pain. This time, after being exposed to loud noises last night in a city, my ears were ringing and have pain. I don't know if I should be concerned about this.

A slight dry cough persisted along with some chest congestion which I ignored. Then some 2 weeks ago, I went back to Austin for a week.

I don't even drink tea or coffee.\n\nI do have a family history of cancer. Known cancers in my family have been cervical, lung, and colon.\n\nAs far as being sick for the last week an a half, when I went to urgent care they told me I had a viral infection in my bronchial tubes. It is contagious, but not influenza. Over the last couple days my Athsma stopped kicking up because of it. Now I just have a wheeze when I breathe, and my lungs are rattling when I cough. Sometimes I cough up mucus, sometimes I don't. My chest feels like daggers, and I feel completely drained of energy. I'm feeling lightheaded, especially after blowing my nose. My nose is not stuffed. My ears do occasionally feel full, but only when I move. They pop and go back to normal while resting.\n\nNow to get to the point...\n\n2 years ago I went to the dentist and he pointed out that I had a lump on my uvula. It looks white in color, but is obviously covered by skin. He told me not to worry about it unless it got bigger or I got more.\n\nAbout 2 months back I noticed a red dot forming below the white lump. It just looks like a tiny cluster of veins. I wasn't feeling too sure about getting it checked out since I work minimum wage, and have a $100 copay to see a specialist.\n\nAbout two or three weeks ago (before I got sick) I noticed that the soft palate of my mouth had turned a yellowish color. It's never been yellow before. I thought it might go away. It hasn't.\n\nTwo days ago I looked in the back of my throat again wondering if I was developing strep throat. I've had it before, so I know what it looks like (unless it can somehow change form).\n\nI know have two lumps on my right tonsil that are identical to the lump on my uvula. They're almost tucked into a corner, so they can be hard to see.\n\nPlease note, I have on occasion coughed up tonsil stones. However, I don't think that's what these are. I can usually feel tonsil stones when they get that big, and they break off. These spots are white tinted bulges in the flesh.\n\nMy questions are... What are they? What could they be? Should I worry about them? How do I get rid of them? What's the cheapest route to Handle this? If I go see my primary care physician, what will he do? Send me to the ENT?

My right ear is weird. I went to a doctor for it and he looked in it and did a hearing test and said they were both fine. But heres the thing. If I move my jaw side to side I hear air squeezing out from what I guess is in my ear. I also hear like a plastic crinkling sound. This does not happen in my other ear. Also frequently my ear will feel like it needs to pop, but if I use the technique where you hold your nose and blow my ear will fill up but wont pop. If this happens I feel very dizzy and like I'm going to pass out. Swallowing doesnt help either. Also my tinnitus flairs up worse in my right ear than in my left.

I began 5 months ago as a once a month endeavor and it progressed to weekends in a row a couple months later. Each time, copius amounts of cocaine was consumed. My last use was 2/18. Since then, Ive read too many horror stories regarding cocaine consumption and would like to quit while I can. One problem occurred, on 2/19 or 2/20 I woke up with buzzing in my left ear and Ive read that cocaine is ototoxic.\n\nI got my ears checked at a local clinic and the nurse couldnt see my ear drums due to wax build up. When she removed the wax she told me my left escherian tube has some fluid build up and is slightly inflamed. I was prescribed flonase and cortisporin ear drops.\n\nMy concern is the combo of flonase and cocaine. Due to my recent heavy abuse, is it safe to use a steroid based nasal spray? Im concerned that I havent given the soft tissue enough time to heal and do not want to cause further damage. I dont have any bleeding or blood in my mucusAlso, could this buzzing be a result of my escherian tube fluid build up more so than cocaine use or is it hard to say?

My ears still itch, and it's gotten so bad that if you asked me the anatomy, potential conditions, and treatments available of my inner, middle, and outter ear, I would ace the test.\n\nWhen I was young I had multiple, BAD, ear infections.

Since that point my itching has only gotten Progressively worse.\n\nMy left ear has had two perforations due to infection (in the years after that visit at 10 years old) and it was the only eardrum to disappear after an explosion I was nearby (yes, disappear). My right ear has it's itchy moments, but overall it's very healthy. My left is my problem child.\n\nI have had allergy tests (all negative), multiple ENT speciallists tell me that my ears are super healthy and that there's nothing wrong! What the heck!?!

This made my tonsils better until the pills were all done and 3 days after my tonsils felt the same so I tried as many home remedies to try to heal my tonsils on there own at home... but nothing worked, so a week after the pills were done I was back in the hospital with white spots on my tonsils even red ones, my tonsils were so swollen to the point where my tongue has gotten swollen to, my whole mouth had became so red, dry, and irritated, I have shivers/chills all the time, feel like I have a bad fever because my whole body is warm & I feel real weak and flushed out of any energy, also having bad body aches, and sharp chest pains/ a ear ache on my right side.. I could not sleep for 2 days at this point or eat/ drink much.. The doctor told me I now have a very serious bacterial infection, was also tested for mono but do not have that apparently. So he prescribed me with 6 PMS DEXAMETHASONE 4MG for 3 days 2 tablets once daily, and 60 MYLAN CLINDAMYCIN 300 MG to take 2 capsules 3 times a day for 10days so I have been taking those for 3 days now and I believe the are not doing anything obviously the pills will take days to take effect but the steroids should have token some swelling down already but it has not. I also had to go back to the hospital yesterday because I was having bad anxiety from not sleeping/ I could not breathe ok at all it felt like my tonsils gotten worse I could actually tell they got more swollen myself.. and the hospital said I had a low grade fever tested me for pneumonia with a chest X-Ray this came back negative as well, he also checked my chest himself and said I was wheezing pretty bad, I have bad asthma they are saying and sent me home without any treatment but a prescription for two asthma puffers, an orange one called FLOVENT HFA and a blue one called VENTOLIN HFA. I have had asthma for all my life so I'm used to taking these but they are not even helping I was told to take the orange one 2 inhalations twice daily one at night and one in the morning for 14 days, and the blue one for when I have shortness of breathe or for when I'm wheezing.. its not helping one bit to help me breathe and my whole body feels very weird I feel confused very tired, having bad body aches still my tonsils do not feel better one bit, my throat is in so much pain that I can barely handle it anymore.

I noticed that when I put headphones on I can't hear as well, and also it seems like I can't hear low frequency as well.\n\nFor example, one morning there was a lawnmower outside of my dorm. Now I was rather far away so I could only hear the low rumble of it. And when I covered my left ear, I could clearly hear it in my right in.

Only in my right though.\n\nNow more recently, my left ear is making these subtle but intense wind sounds almost. This is so hard to explain, but it is almost like when you put a cup or sea shell up to your ear. It's harder to hear the stuff around you, but there is that intense low rumble in your ear.

First I mix up a plain pure salt mix, about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon per 6oz clean distilled or purified water a little warmer than room temp, about 80deg F, and set to the side.\n\n2. Then I swish and gargle with 2.5ml Povidone-Iodine mixed with 8.5 to 10ml water or natural mouthwash for 60-120 seconds and spit.\n\n3. Next I'm using a nebulizer (aka essential oil diffuser from Young Living) and I get close to the outlet hole, and breathe long deep slow breaths with a towel over the diffuser and my head for 5 minutes. I do this before and after the sinus irrigation procedures (next) to help better coat and open my sinuses. I fill the diffuser with 2-3oz clean water and add:\n2 drops viral essential oil mix like Thieves or On-Guard,\n2 drops essential oil mix like Breathe,\n1oz pure full strength edible Aloe Vera juice,\n6 drops Nascent Iodine,\n4 drops white Iodine (has potassium Iodide too, NOT Potassium Chloride).\nI then fill remainder of reservoir with water.

She is 7 years old. We have to go see an ID - Infectious Disease doctor. I can't find much in a google search about this as it is considered a rare disease. She does not have TB pulmonary that we know of. I wonder if I should insist the pediatrician order a chest xray? or CT as other tests are inconclusive per articles I read... She has had a multitude of ear infections and now on tube 4 in that ear... the 3rd tube perforated and they had to remove it and added another tube as it was \"swampy\" with infection the doctor said. They took a culture and sent it to New York to be analyzed by a specialist. Now with this diagnosis I have so many questions and don't want to wait for ID appointment. I see things about treatment being chemotherapy related ...is this the only treatment? The doctor only said that there would be different antibiotics orally and into the ear but did not go into details. The doctor says she is not contagious... but how did SHE get in first place?

Did she pick this up from someone else that was sick? I only read that it is normally a secondary dx to Primary Pulmonary TB in most cases... sometimes the ear is primary but does not discuss how it came to be!

She underwent IVIG Treatment and regained all of her skin back after a week. She then got diagnosed at 6 years old with pneumococcal antibody deficiency and now this?? All these uncommon/rare things happening to her it is making me so worried for my daughter's life! I would just like as much info on possible treatments and what we will be looking to deal with in the long run and what type of important things that I might miss should I ask the doctor. I am not clinical but I work in a family care office so I get the gist of most medical terms but a lot is over my head at this point.
