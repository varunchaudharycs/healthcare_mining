This never happend before and was new.\nIt was weird because it came on strong and sudden with the hot dog. I think it did very slightly start a month before as I was drinking more tea and occasionally it was weird to swallow water but not that noticeable or that often.\nI went to the doctor the following day after hardly any sleep and they have me Lansoprazole, and it did help starting on 2 doses at 30mg each. After I needed to take a lot of Gaviscon and it was quite bad I had to take the strong Gaviscon. Now I am on Omeprazole, I was on a single dose but I am now on 2 doses per day. This normally fixes after a week but now I am 3 months in and it's not getting better.\n\nI don't get heartburn or any feeling whatsoever, I just get the result of not being able to swallow water.\nPreviously on Lansoprazole I kept getting too much saliva production which was weird, thats seem to have gone with Omeprazole.\n\nYou can see red veins in the back of my throat\nand yellow/white splotches over the throat where it is all burnt from the acid. The side of my tonsils has a purple vein on it thats kind of bulging out like a spot. Again there are veins showing all around that area.\n\nIt can be hard to swallow, since being on 2 doses of PPI I am able to swallow but sometimes it's tricky to swallow water at first, it takes me a few seconds to get it to a swallowing point which is scary.\nI even stopped drinking water for weeks because it was hard to swallow.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this, where they have had the problem before then it comes back and won't resolve?\nIs there anything else that could be a problem?\nI have been eating really basic food, nothing on the naughty list.\nI have to take 2 doses of Omeprazole for 1 month then go back to the doctor. I might have to have another endoscopy if it doesn't fix.\nI previous had one on my second case of this a few years back and it came back with no issues.\n\nThanks for anyone who adds their comments.","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"16 days ago","resp_title":"RE: GERD - Acid Reflux without the heartburn","resp_content":"It sounds like you have silent reflux.

When my stool is not hard enough I can’t pass all of it out. Some of it remains in my rectum since I’m partially incontinent.\n\nThe cause is Cauda equina syndrome. This syndrome started after a tumor was removed from my spinal cord in the L1/L2 area in 2002. My gastro intestinal doctor prescribed Loperamide (Imodium AD), 8MG a day. When the Loperamide was prescribed it hardened my stool so all of it is passed out completely. This medication worked great for 14 years but now has not been working at all.\n\nIf I don’t use my finger or another method to clean and remove the loose stool, the remaining the stool will slowly come out and soil my underwear to a point where some people may smell it.\n\nI would like to know what options I have to remove the loose leftover stool.\n\nI’ve tried the following:\n\n1. My finger – This takes time and I can never get my rectum 100% clean.\n\n2. Enema squeeze bottle. These don’t work well for me because of weakness in my hands combined with my incontinence. The water can start coming out before I want it to. When they do work they do a great job but these are not an option for me. If someone is looking at this post and would like to see what I’m talking about go to this link ...\n\n3. Enema. I purchased a full enema kit. The issue I have here is the water will start coming out before I want it to and the nozzle does not always stay in because of my incontinence. My rectum can’t grasp the nozzle correctly. When the enema does work it does a good job. I did find an enema tip that was larger, it did help me hold on to it better.\nHere’s what I purchased: ...\n\n4. Fingernail cleaning brush. I’ve been using a fingernail cleaning brush to remove the leftover loose stool currently. I put soap where I’m going to stick it in, insert it and turn it around in a circular motion and then remove it. This does a great job to remove the leftover stool but after using it until the stool is gone there will be some blood on the brush. This worries me. For example getting an infection where a small cut or scrape is.\n\nMy questions are has anyone out there found another way to remove the stool that is leftover besides a finger or enema?\n\nIs there a medical handheld device that will allow me to remove the stool like the fingernail brush but safer?\n\nAlso just a side question.\nI don’t know how I created an account with the Screen Name “bowel”\nIs there a way to change this?\n\nThanks Everyone,\n\nDana","like_count":"0","tags":["IBD","Irritable Bowel Syndrome"]},"responses":[{"author":"jibijibi","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Incomplete bowel movements – How do you remove excess stool?","resp_content":"Stop using the brush, you are only going to damage the tissue, which could lead to serious problems D:\n\nReally all you should need is a decent quality toilet roll for most cases.

I am a 45 yr. old very active female who had maintained a healthy weight and never had any digestive issues before. In June of 2018 I experienced some sort of attack after waking up (not after eating) that included extreme pain in my abdomen (all over) and violent belching that lasted all that day. From that point on, I had no appetite, was unable to eat except for very small amounts and had what was later diagnosed as Supra Gastric Belching, which I learned how to control through deep breathing exercises. In addition, I would have periodic “attacks” that included severe and painful abdominal spasms that did not correlate with eating. I lost 20 lbs. in just a few months. I saw several respected GI Dr.’s, including one that specializes in hard to diagnose GI issues. I had every test done, but none showed any issues that explained by attacks. Scans did show that my gallbladder had a stone, but every Dr. said that the gallstone was not blocking anything and was not inflamed, so they did not think it was my issue. Having a history of gallbladder cancer in my family, I decided that I would get my gallbladder removed. The surgeon removed my gallbladder in Dec. of 2018 and the routine 1 hr. surgery took 4 hrs. The surgeon stated that the gallbladder was extremely inflamed and had extensive adhesions that took a lot of time to remove. After my gallbladder was removed I continued to have difficulty eating (not being able to eat much or very many different foods). I developed pains in the middle of my back when eating that I never had before my gallbladder removal, along with pain that felt like my entire abdomen was in a vice grip (with or without eating) that no medicines helped with. In addition, my energy level never returned after the surgery, and in fact, was getting worse. At the time of my gallbladder removal the surgeon also did a MRCP that showed everything all clear. I returned to the surgeon who did an ultrasound and those results were normal.\n\nAfter my gallbladder removal in Dec. of 2018, I still get attacks, but they are different than before and happen way less often. Also, my energy level started to go down. I have had CT Scans, several scopes (upper & lower), lots of blood tests, Small Bowl Capsule Study, Endoscopic Ultrasounds, Lactulose Breath Test for SIBO, and CT-Angiography Abdomen, all of which have had no findings. I have tried several elimination diets. My pain does not depend on any particular food type or what I can and cannot eat is constantly changing.\n\nFrustrated, in July of 2019, I went to see a new GI, who prescribed me Levsin (anti-spasmodic). I had already tried Bentyl (a different anti-spasmodic), but it did not help. However, for the past 6 months the Levsin has been helping me. It allowed me to eat a little bit more and more of a variety of foods, allowing me to get at least a bit more calories in daily than I had eaten in a year (although I still was very limited on what and how much I could eat). However, my fatigue continued to decrease, and from July of 2019 to early Jan. of 2020, I have become unable to do many things I was able to do before my gallbladder removal (driving at night b/c of fatigue, going to the gym or anything physically draining), which I am sure has a lot to do with my low intake of food. Also, I have not had a menstrual cycle in 2 months (also might be from low intake of food).\n\nAbout a week ago, I had another attack, and since that time the Levsin is no longer helping me eat. Now, I have no appetite, and I make sure I eat, but when I do I can only eat very few bites without being in pain. I have started to lose weight again, which scares me. I have 2 children graduating from high school this year, so I was determined to not spend any more time and money on trying to “fix me” until I got them settled in at college in Aug., however, the recent change of events has caused me to start searching again because my quality of life if just unbearable.\n\nI believe my problem could have to do with my biliary system, specifically, possibly Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction. However, my GI states that my bile duct is not dilated on CT, so that cannot be my issue. However, my gallbladder did not look like is was causing any problems on any imaging/tests, so I do not have a lot of faith in that.

About 4 years ago, I was diagnosed with gastritis on top of having an inflamed gallbladder that works at about 12%. I have been taking Prevacid for those 4 years and I have yet to get my gallbladder removed, even though I am planning on it. I don't have any gallstones, but it is inflamed and there is family history of having poor gallbladders. I have always been bloated and uncomfortable after eating, but lately it has gotten worse, especially this year. This whole year it has been worse than years past, but now I feel very uncomfortable and I can barely tolerate big meals without feeling complete discomfort. What I think is a \"big meal\" is what others think of as an average meal -- for reference, the other night I was beside myself after eating some fries and 2 *finger hamburgers. They're fatty and fried, but I felt the same way this morning after having a slice of toast, a tablespoon of egg yoke, and some zucchini. No matter the meal, I am uncomfortable after eating... even hours later. I lose my apetite, and lately I have sometimes been getting headaches after eating. I have also recently been having episodes of having sudden shortness of breath randomly and sometimes feeling faint which hasn't occurred in years past. I have been tested for food allergies and I am not allergic to anything (although I personally believe I might be gluten intolerant). I am also constantly belching and sometimes after eating I develop a strange yellow/green coating on my tongue (and I have great dental hygiene). My abdomen is also very tender. This is understandable with having a poor gallbladder and gastritis, but it is tender to the touch no matter when I eat. Should I get this checked with my doctor? Can gastritis get \"worse?\" Does this mean my gallbladder is just ready to be removed? I'm confused and I don't understand what is going on, but I also don't think it's worth going to the doctor for because I feel as if they will tell me it's just my gallbladder...

All of my blood tests are normal but I have symptoms that indicate that my liver is not functioning optimally. I would recommend looking into changing diet as well as adding some walking to your routine. Wellness is a lifelong quest. I believe that once the doctors have done all they can when the problem is chronic, it is up to us to figure out the rest. There are many websites that list foods that heal the liver, and that will improve the health of the body. It has been said that the liver is the health of the body, so if this is shingles or something else, doing these things may help. One very easy thing to implement is to drink the juice of 1/2 a fresh lemon in warm water every morning. Then drink water, not milk or juice, at least 6 glasses a day. Cut out sugar, but raw honey is ok. And don't eat refined foods.

I will be on reddit or watching youtube or something and after a few minutes i finish the video i am watching. I look around and realize the person is gone but left his speakers on the bench.\n\nI am thinking he will probably return shortly to get it, when a few moments later, another stranger comes, snatches the speaker and runs off with it. A few moments after THAT the original stranger (and owner of the speakers) comes back and realizes its gone.\n\n\"Did you see what happened to my speakers?\" He asks\n\nNow at this point most people would be fine and give the \"yeah some dude with long hair in an orange shirt took it and ran off in that direction\". But i have the sensation i mentioned that only goes away with prolonged unresponsiveness. So i dont say anything.\n\nThe stranger (owner of the speakers) presses further; \"YO DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?\" (now hes getting aggressive). I continue to be unresponsive. The stranger is getting suspiscious. \"Yo did you take my speakers?\"\n\nI now understand the situation is escallating and he is now coming closer to me. I continue to be unresponsive for the sake of my health. I am not bleeding the next time i take a dump just because someone else was careless with their belongings.\n\nI look up and now am staring at him in the eyes, still not saying a word. \"Yo... you got a problem?\" He asks. I continue to stare and not respond hoping hed get hint i am not in the mood to talk. He obviously doesnt. Clearly he was raised with the custom that when someone says \"hi how are you doing\" you reply \"good how are you\" back and that if you dont comply with this oppressive tradition you are labelled as rude.\n\nI go bqck to watching videos when he walks up and flips my baseball cap on the ground. I knock him out on the spot. A few days later apparantly i am back at the park and the guy is there again. He has misinformed his friends that i had stolen his speakers and knocked him out.\n\nI clarify that what happened to his speakers and that i had punched him in response to him flipping my hat off. They ask why i couldnt just say \"i didnt do it\" a few days ago and i explain to them my internal process, the constipation, the unresponsiveness, etc and that i could not SAY A WORD WHENEVER I GET THIS SENSATION. NOT A WORD\n\nBeing the apes they were they tell me that not a single one of them has ever encountered an indovidual like me. They dont believe my explanation, still think i stole the speakers, punched their friend for no reason, then proceed to jump me. They then lecture me as im laying on the ground that its rude to ignore people. I tell them that everyone has the right to respond or not respond however they want and THEY ARE ACTUALLY the rude/inconsiderate/entitled ones for DEMANDING RESPONSIVENESS. This posses them off further and they kick me a few more times before spitting on me and leaving\n\nIll eventually gather up my own group and get them back for that eventually, but is there anything i could do anything about this condition in the mean time?

At this point I was thinking maybe it wasn't stomach related and was just more conventional pain so I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep. I got about 2 more hours of \"sleep\". This time when I woke up the pain had subsided to a tolerable level. I would call it a \"normal\" heartburn level. And I was actually hungry. My stomach was growling so I made some bacon and eggs and coffee. This didn't effect the pain level. Lower than it was initially, but still a constant heartburn pain that stays in the same spot. Since pepto bismol had no effect so I have not taken anymore. Just drinking water. Tried to get some more sleep during the day. Still no other symptoms other than uncomfortable heartburn as of 9pm.

I've had problems with my gut my entire life, and am now 57. I've had every test known to man, upper and lower GI's, CT's, colonoscopy...you name it, I've had it done. I finally had one gastro tell me I had IBS-D. So, I began to pay very close attention to what I eat, and what can set it off. Sometimes though, I just get a bad case of diarrhea and gas and I don't know what set it off. So, I mostly eat a very bland diet and I take supplements because I know I'm not getting proper nutrition through my diet, and I take Imodium every day. I also take a calcium supplement with vitamin D and minerals with dinner every night. It takes time to tame your gut, but you have to find out what sets it off and avoid those foods like the plague. You'll need to eat a low fat diet, too. I'm not lactose intolerant, so I can have some dairy, but I have to watch the fat content. When I wake around 3am to go to the loo, I take 2 Imodium and I chew 2 anti-gas tablets that contain simethicone. Then I go back to sleep. When I get up for work a couple hours later, I feel pretty good, and no pain, no diarrhea. It took a while for this to work, it didn’t happen overnight. You are your own best advocate. You have to pay close attention to your diet to know what sets your gut off. You also have to lower your stress level. Exercise helps with digestion and stress relief. I’ve done a lot of reading, and your gut contains many of the same hormones as your brain, which is why your gut is affected by stress. De-stressing your life is so helpful in taming your gut. I get all of my Imodium and anti-gas tablets at the dollar store. I get my calcium supplements from Walmart. On the occasions that I do get a case of diarrhea, I take a Koapectate tab along with the 2 Imodium tabs. I’m so much better now. I still have a bad time every now and again, but I can get it under control. I’m now able to travel and go places and do things I’d been afraid to do because I was always looking for a bathroom. So…I’m saying, find out what sets off your gut and avoid those foods like they’re poison. Stick to a low fat diet. Take a calcium supplement with your meals. Take the Imodium and anti-gas tabs before you have symptoms and de-stress your life as much as possible. Also get some exercise, even if it’s only taking a walk. It may take as much as 2 weeks before you begin to see improvement, but stick with it. If you find you are becoming constipated, cut back on the calcium supplement. I only take one with dinner, and this works for me. I wish you all luck in taming your angry guts.\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"5 months ago","resp_title":"RE: I am a 54 year old female who has many health issues and I feel too young to be sick all of the time.","resp_content":"I was 51 (m) when I started my journey back from the dead (+50 lbs, hypertension and just diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes).\n\nHere's the bottomline (after losing the weight, hbp and the diabetes, 12 years ago).

We took him back to the Pediatric Gastrologist a couple of months ago and a second upper endo was done, this time with bravo.

When speaking to the Doctor about the results, he agreed a lot of the problems could be caused by anxiety as he tends to be a nervous child.

I don't feel like myself. I feel intoxicated or extremely high, but in a very bad way. I need to reiterate: this is not minor...this is life-stalling. And I experience it every day...4 to 5 times a day. An hour after I eat.\n-my symptoms usually go away in an hour or two\n-this brain fog is often accompanies by other symptoms, but these will often cycle in and out depending on the week (stomach discomfort, non-stop burping, indigestion, bloating, flatulence, acid reflux)\n-I never had any digestive troubles or food allergies leading up to this\n-This literally happened over night. One day I was fine. The next day...all of this. 16 months later. He we are. I have been suffering in isolation with this as no one knows what is wrong!\n-A few times now I've done a 2 day water fast. This makes me feel great! Symptom free! I'm tired, and hungry obviously, but fasting is the ONLY thing I've discovered that let's me temporarily live a normal life\n\nDoctors:\n\n-I've seen every doctor that I've could. Almost 20.\n-blood work is normal\n-endoscopy was normal\n-tested negative for celiac and lactose intolerance\n-barium swallow was normal\n-Doctor's keep saying \"sorry, we don't know what's wrong with you. You seem extremely healthy\"\n-dietitian has no idea\n-stool samples didn't show anything out of the ordinary\n-negative breath test for methane and hydrogen producing SIBO\n\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n-paleo diet\n-gluten free\n-dairy free\n-vegetarian\n-no sugar\n-low FODMAP\n-2 day water fasting\n\nThis is ruining my life. I need help. Please. Someone help me. It's like I'm having an allergic reaction to everything!\n\nThe only other thing worth mentioning is this. In the month leading up to Day 1 of my symptoms, I was extremely low carb, and eating a lot of egg whites. I was also quite stressed out at the time. I have since moved back to a normal healthy, balanced, and clean diet - and I have eliminated a lot of stressors from my life. But the symptoms remain. Every time I eat...they show up and hour later.

She has Juv. RA, and has been on some pretty heavy meds her whole life. We suspect that this has caused these issues. She has tried Gluten free, cutting out dairy and many, many, other things. One thing we seem to be noticing, is a negative affect after stopping a course of antibiotics. For example, she had major jaw surgeries X4 over the past few months. They had her automatically start a course of antibiotics after the surgeries to prevent infection. While on the antibiotics, her GI symptoms largely disappear. However, when she stops antibiotics, she starts having trapped gas feelings / pressure in her abdomen. To the point of putting pressure on her bladder and causing her to have to urinate every 5 to 10 minutes. And very little urine is produced when she goes. She is seeing a very prominent GI doctor who will occasionally, when her symptoms start acting up, will prescribe Rifaxin (sp). She feels as close to 100% as she is capable while on it, usually a 2 week course I think, but then afterwards she will rebound in the other direction and have the severe pains. She's tried probiotics, Gas X, and many other things. We don't know what to do. Her quality of life is horrible when she's like this.

Help!!","post_content":"I’m very new here, and have searched and found similar threads, but nothing exactly what I’m going through, so I apologize if this has been asked before. For the past few years I’ve been suffering from chronic constipation, sometimes only going once every one to two weeks. When I do go it will be (sorry to be graphic) very large and rock hard. Sometimes they will be like balls, like each meal I ate is separate from another. Sometimes they would create little tears which I would see streaks of blood on the toilet paper. However it’s now very different and I’m very scared. I have been drinking Metamucil and taking a stool softener daily. For about a week I did this with nothing b happening, but today I did go. It was not all of what is backed up but a good start. However when I wiped there was a decent amount of blood, much more than ever before. I did not feel any pain or tearing so I don’t think that was it. Then, about 10-15 minutes later I felt a little like I needed to go again and when I did it felt like a little bit of the runs but when I looked it was just a glob of blood. This has happened twice, same leadup- a week of softeners and Metamucil then after a week I would go, then a glob of blood. It’s not dark or blackish, but bright red. Now I’m very nervous! I have never had issues like this before and I think it was originally partly caused by my job- I went from a job on my feet to a job at a desk, so I’m much less active, and I also would frequently have to hold it because the bathrooms at work were always out of order, and by the time I got to a bathroom I couldn’t go anymore, sometimes for a few days. I’m thinking doing that over and over may have contributed to my chronic constipation, but I’m very concerned about the blood. It isn’t from a tear or fissure on the outside from passing something hard, because I will feel like I have to go a little and a glob of blood will come out. The last time this happened it wasn’t hard at all when I went to the bathroom. The blood will sink in the toilet and stay together, it wasn’t affected by the water and there would also be blood on the toilet paper.

Like some of the most excruciating pain I’ve ever had. I’ve dealt with some pretty intense pain from a motorcycle accident I broke out over half my teeth, dislocated my jaw, ripped one of my thumbs almost completely off, broke a few bones, etc so I can deal with pain. I’ve talked to doctors and they say it’s gastritis or IBS or possibly even an ulcer. I don’t know. I should mention I am also on MAT (medicated assisted treatment) for opioid use. I take Subutex which has its own fun side effects. One being constipation. Anyway all this has a point I’m not just rambling on about myself. This new stomach pain makes me live almost 100% in a state of panic. Which in turn makes the stomach pain worse. I have dealt with acid reflux most of my adult life and take Prilosec daily.\n\nI’ll try to describe it; it’s dead center under that dip in the sternum. It’s like a gnawing burning pain. It starts by feeling like I drank to much sweet alcohol or girly beer. And from there it will intensify to kind of a stabbing pain. Sometimes it will go away completely. Sometimes I can go a whole day without the pain. But that is rare. During the morning/afternoon it isn’t as bad it’s there but tolerable at night tho...that’s when it gets bad. It kind of feels like I am clenching my stomach muscle constantly. You know how you do when you tighten it up to see your abs lol. I’m a skinny dude so it not from me sucking in my gut. It drives me crazy. Sometimes if I lay down and relax and just chill to some meditation music and relax it seems to go away and it seems to get worse when I’m stressed. So I have no idea what to think. I feel like it could be an ulcer or ibs or a combination of things related to constipation and stress. Sometimes if I can pass gas or a bowel movement it helps the pain go away.\n\nI don’t have insurance that’s why I haven’t been able to go to a doctor to have labs done yet.

My gas is particularly smelly and I have trouble keeping it in in social settings such as school, work, home, etc. I have tried many diet changes such as avoiding foods that are known to cause these occurrences. I do have mild lactose intolerance but it barely affects how my bathroom trips turn out. Nearly 10-15 mins after I go poop, I continue to pass gas until my next bathroom trip which is very hard to do considering there are limited breaks during school and work for me to do so.

I have not had an endoscopy, but I have had a scope down the nose at the ENT and all they could tell me was it looked a little red, but there were no polyps or granulomas, or abrasions. Anyway, I know that one potential reason for having GERD and/or LPR is because of a hiatal hernia, which I believe is where your stomach actually moves up into the place where your diaphragm is and puts extra pressure on it which causes the intra abdominal pressure that causes the LES to open and let the acid move up into your esophagus and throat. I have searched youtube and found several exercises that actually help you to gently relocate your stomach and diaphragm, but I Have not yet tried any of them faithfully enough to get any results as I don't yet have confirmation that I even have a hiatal hernia and I have little time to try out things just on a hunch being as busy as I am with work. It sounds like what your describing with the stretching of the diaphragm and throat in a downward position that gives you relief may be the same type of exercise as the ones I have seen demonstrated. Maybe that is something to look into for you. I know the symptoms and complications from GERD/LPR are very uncomfortable and concerning at times and can be pretty frustrating when there is no one who can relate.

My gastro tests were normal. This was about two years ago. I had occasional bouts with painful cramps and diarrhea and sometimes constipation but I was able to lead a fairly normal life and could make plans to go with confidence. I merely made sure to scout out where the rest room was when I got there--just in case.\n\nNearly a month ago my diarrhea episodes suddenly turned daily. The worst aspect is that it doesn't all come out at once but in several bouts over a couple of hours and even longer. In other words, I have no idea when I am done now and can no longer go out. The stools usually start out fairly solid but still have that diarrhea smell. They end up very watery. I decided to add more bran to my diet and it seemed to help briefly. My stools were entirely solid and well-formed and they passed without cramping. I thought I had cured my chronic diarrhea until I happened to run out of the raisin and oat clusters cereal I was eating. That was just prior to Thanksgiving day. I was invited to the home of a relative and consumed nothing all morning so I would not be bloated and could eat. Regardless, I took very small portions of a few things as I know I can no longer consume a large meal. I felt fine until I got up to go home after a couple of hours. Walking the very short distance to my car, I felt I couldn't catch my breath--the absolute worst episode of this I ever experienced. I struggled to breath all the way home and, luckily, it wasn't far. After lying down at home, I felt better--but like something was stuck, my entire small meal, that wasn't being digested. It persisted during the night and so I took some Miralax. The next day resulted in terrible and painful bouts of diarrhea but some relief at last. As soon as I could, I bought some more bran cereal and have been eating that for the past few days. Nothing good has come of it. Just stuck at home with diarrhea and uncomfortable bloating. Hardly dare to eat anything else. Today is Sunday and I know I should phone my gastro doc tomorrow--but wonder if I can even keep an appointment as I am so incontinent.

Possibly something else? (Warning-long detailed post with a timeline of my symptoms)","post_content":"I'm a 21 year old female and have had digestive issues my whole life which have gotten terrible in the last couple years. As a baby I had diarrhea and intestinal inflammation any time I was fed and they said it was just a dairy and soy allergy which I eventually grew out of..? I remember being a little kid 3-4 yrs old and suffering terrible constipation and pain with bowel movements. That too eventually went away and a few years later at age 7 I remember every day I had really bad intestinal pain and nausea (only occasionally vomiting) and I was so used to it I thought it was normal and never talked to my parents about it. I remember one day it just stopped. When I was at the end of my freshman year in high school I started to notice any time I ate, I'd have extreme abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and irregular stools. I usually went pretty often with soft stools but not much diarrhea..sometimes constipation. I had constant fatigue and brain fog. I had anemia symptoms even though they said my iron count was in range. I always was hungry and had a huge appetite so I ate good despite the fact that I would be in pain. My symptoms were so bad that it made functioning normally and going to school very hard for me. I also lost about 30 pounds in 3 months..no dieting, exercise, or anything. I had basic tests done and everything was normal. The doctor told me it was stress but I wasn't buying it. This continued for the next couple years and my weight would fluctuate between 110-125 (I'm about 5'5). I ended up dropping out of highschool and home schooling myself because my fatigue was so bad and energy was so low. School was very hard for me. I discovered certain foods would make my symptoms worse-wheat, grains, gluten, oats, dairy, soy, legumes, and some vegetables. So I was able to manage my symptoms a little better with dieting. My weight was up to 125. When I was 19 is when I started to notice soft black stools with dark blood mixed in and sometimes it was so much the water in the toilet would be blood red. I was going to the bathroom frequently and every time I did I felt a piercing pain in my abdomen. There was never a specific side or place of pain. This lasted for about a month or two and I dropped down to 99 lbs. i was so low on energy that it was very difficult to even get out of bed in the morning and I found myself passing out at times. I spent way too much time sleeping. The doctor ruled it out as stress (yes even the blood in my stool, even though I told him I have nothing to be stressed about other than my symptoms) saying \"almost every girl your age who suffers these symptoms either has stds or stressed over drama and boys\" which made me furious because it certainly was not the case for me. Fast forward to now - my weight stays around 110 which is still underweight for me. I suffer terrible fatigue and anemia symptoms. I mainly only eat foods that don't bother me as much such as white meat, fruits, and some cooked vegetables. I still go through spouts of diarrhea. I have constipation but with soft stools. There usually is maroon swirls and specks in it, black specks, a lot of mucus, and sometimes what looks like flesh. My stools are at times green, yellow, orange, or black but rarely ever brown. I have terrible abdominal pain. My bloating is so bad that I look pregnant and it hurts. I get extremely swollen. Sometimes I have acid reflux but rare. I have only learned how to naturally manage symptoms but it never goes away. My symptoms used to come only after eating which still is usually the case but at times it comes on randomly. It will last anywhere from a few days at a time to a few weeks. It's been making day to day functions and work very difficult for me.

Before the lancing I was on doxycycline (100 mg), and after I did a complete course of clindamycin in a stronger dose (300 mg). The abscess itself and the lancing gave me a fever and made me pretty sick. During and after the antibiotics my bowel movements changed drastically. I have been having trouble with bright red blood in my stool and when I wipe since May due to hemorrhoids. Now my hemorrhoids are terrible, and my bowel movements are mostly watery with blood and mucus. Any sort of straining back there can cause blood to come out. I went to pass gas the other day and instead ended up with a thick blood and mucus mixture. The stool itself is minimal and hardly solid. I often go several times in the morning, and often almost directly after eating. The urgency of a movement can not be ignored or else the result might be tragic. I am incredibly gassy as well, I can often hear it churning through my tummy. It seems like something has shifted somewhere in my digestive tract or things are moving through me too quickly. I don’t really have any other symptoms besides the occasional stomachache before and after going. Prior to all of this, I had normal bowel movements once or twice a day. My broke college student diet isn’t the greatest, but nothing has really changed there. I have been taking probiotics to try and regulate the bacteria in my gut and Metamucil to up my fiber intake. I even did an enema to try and flush things out but I couldn’t even hold it in for more than five minutes. I’m at a loss as to what to do.

For about 4 months I’ve been experiencing near constant burping as well as a range of other things:\n- burping\n- dull headaches/lightheaded ness (usually on left hand side or at the back). Sometimes can’t really stand up without feeling wobbly / like I could collapse\n- hot flushes\n- occasional stomach pain\n- shortness of breath (particularly just as I’m about to sleep). Sometimes effecting my sleep pattern as I can’t get to sleep easily. Usually can be relieved by burping\n- coughing\n- infrequent weakness in left shoulder\n- dry heaving\n\nI can’t seem to point out what might be triggering this. I don’t drink much coffee, eat fairly healthily (I don’t eat breakfast but my lunch and dinners are generally healthy). I drink excessive water if anything - probably 3-4L per day and rarely drink soft drinks, don’t drink energy drinks at all etc. I drink alcohol on average once a week on a weekend.\n\nI am a fairly light smoker (about 5-6 per day) and I’m in the process of trying to give that up. I had a day off over the last weekend (well 23 hours anyway) and that didn’t seem to help at all.\n\nSo far I’ve visited the doctors a few times and had the following:\n- urea breath test for h.pylori (negative)\n- blood test (everything good except at the time indicated I had a virus - they didn’t do anything further about this other than referring me for a follow up blood test which I’m yet to do)\n- stomach ultrasound (to check for gallstones - was all good)\n\nThis is really starting to bug me - mainly the burping constantly at work and on the train with people noticing it and of course the light headed feeling. I’m not sure what else to do as the doctors don’t seem to know anymore or recommend anything.\n\nI’ve had a look myself online and the symptoms I have look as thought they point to a stomach ulcer / possible anaemia.

You should try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day because that will definitely help and eat three or four servings of fruit because it definitely helped when I was having issues. Also the scripts the doctor gave you maybe there's just generic versions of it and if not you'll have to tell the doctor if you haven't already that you need something cheap because you can't pay for it and also ask if this other meds that you can take. Also do a Google search to see if they have coupons for the meds that you need because a lot of times for the first 6 months or whatever the drug companies will have coupons and the meds are really cheap.

His presentation of this disorder has been very mild in comparison to other patients but he has had one significant surgery so far and that was a Mitral Valve Replacement. About two months ago, he appeared to have contracted a stomach virus. He had the usual nausea, vomiting, fever, and stomach pain associated with the run of the mill stomach virus, along with severe dehydration and ten pounds of weight loss. His spleen was also significantly swollen, with no obvious reason.\n\nHe seemingly recovered from the acute symptoms in a few days but he has had continued pain in the right upper quadrant of his stomach/abdominal region that comes and goes with no particular pattern and has gotten substantially worse over time. The nausea has also not relented and he is having a great deal of difficulty having bowel movements. He 1.) cannot have one at all, 2.) can have one, but it is mainly diarrhea or \"rabbit turds\" as he calls them (Haha :-)) and there is very little of that.\n\nHis primary care physician has run all manner of blood tests, performed an ultrasound and a CT scan, and has found no physical evidence that there is anything wrong other than a swollen spleen. We were referred to a Hematologist/Oncologist, who ran more blood tests and performed an exam. Everything came back totally normal. That doctor referred us to a Gastroenterologist, who performed an upper endoscopy scope. There was some mild inflammation along his digestive tract and the doctor took biopsies. A few days later, a hepatobiliary scan (HIDA scan) was performed to measure the function of his gallbladder and liver. Again, the results of both tests were completely normal. As a preventative measure, the doctor prescribed Protonix once a day and Sucralfate twice a day. My fiance is now scheduled for a colonoscopy later on this month.\n\nOn his own, he has tried a liquid diet, removing dairy from his diet and probiotics to no avail. This entire ordeal has been very draining on my fiance. He has not been able to eat, sleep or function normally for the majority of the last two months. He is in constant fear of when the pain and nausea will strike again, as there is no discernible pattern.\n\nNo one seems to have a clue what maybe causing this and we are at our witts end at this point.

Whenever I am on a bus or light rail, I get intestinal cramping, increased flatulence, faster/harder heartbeat, and feel as if I have the urgent need to use the bathroom. Deep, controlled breathing doesn't help. Several of these situations did result in me having borderline diarrhea once I got myself to a toilet, but most of the time I find that I am constipated, needing to strain to get anything out at all (if anything at all). This does NOT occur when I am riding in a car, while walking, or when sitting someplace stationary (home, work, even a sports game). In those situations, I might feel a completely normal need to have a bowel movement, but nothing to the degree that I feel on buses.\n\nI have dealt with constipation for most of my life and have been trying to find ways to treat it, and as of one year ago I've been improving my diet with more water and fiber. But I don't believe this diet change is what's been causing this horrible feeling, since it's only been happening for over a month (and the diet changes have not made any positive impact on my constipation, either). As a result, I've been having to take ride share services to get around instead of the bus, resulting in me spending waaaay more money than I should be (my bus pass is at a discounted price through my employer and grants me unlimited bus rides each month, so it's a great deal). I do not know how to drive and never have had to own a car.\n\nIf this is some sudden flare-up of IBS that I've been unaware of, then there's little I can do since I've been doing everything that would naturally be suggested for IBS in the first place: More fiber, more water, and regular (light) exercise. I've been seeing a nutritionist and am about to talk to my gastroenterologist in two weeks, and the only advice I've been given so far has been to try probiotics (nutritionist) or a fiber supplement (gastro). The first time I tried the probiotic I was recommended, it made me feel horribly sick the following morning, giving me nausea, gas, and diarrhea, so I didn't take it again after that. But last night (almost 2 weeks after I first tried the probiotic) I finally got around to opening the capsule so that I could pour 1/4 of the contents into a glass of water (as recommended by not only my nutritionist but also the probiotic's developer), and I had no side effects this morning. So, I will see if that does anything over the next few months. And if that fails to help my constipation and random urgency, then I will resort to the fiber supplement (Cetracel was the one my gastro mentioned).\n\nBut of course, if the probiotic helps at all, it will take some time, so I am posting here to see if anyone has any suggestions in the meantime. Please note that this uncomfortable, anxiety-inducing feeling has ONLY been happening on public transportation. That leads me to believe that whatever is wrong with my gut right now is becoming agitated/stimulated by the often exaggerated motions of buses, whereas a car and even walking are far smoother and controlled. But...why the heck would that be happening in the first place? Especially if the urgency is not always related to diarrhea/soft stools? This has been causing tons of unnecessary stress/anxiety and I feel I am burning my money away.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/56441/bowel-movement-urgency-when-on-public-transport"},{"post":{"author":"kbeck42744","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Stomach issues","post_content":"12 weeks ago I started having bloating, nausea, pain on my right side under the ribs.

First only cigarettes then marijuana as well. I started travelling more and my healthy living declined. I would overdose on Marijuana until I got panic attacks. I would only do it just so I could forget about my depression and then feel better after getting over those panic attacks.\n\nAfter a pretty heavy one I decided to cut down on the weed. But then, in late 2016 just as I was getting over the breakup I had the weirdest pain I ever experienced. This happened a week after I got some tooth fillings at the dentist. I was in the office at work and all of a sudden I felt a weird feeling in my stomach, sharp pain, difficulty breathing and my heart racing. I got completely confused and told my manager think I am having a heart attack. Went to the A&E where they told me to take some Nexium (40 mg a day) and Gaviscon. I kept on having similar attacks every couple of days for another week or so. Then I gradually got better (not all symptoms had diminished but at least the panic attacks had stopped) . However, after I stopped the Nexium, I got an awful acid rebound. Pain got back worse and so did panic attacks which I used to get at night time. I was put on Pantoprazole 40 mg and Ranitidine 300 MG. Took about 2 months until I got a bit better and the panic attacks at night stopped too. I had an endoscopy done and all the doc could see was mild gastritis. Had parasite testing done as well as stool tests to look for parasites and potential IBD antigens . All came back clear.\n\nI went back on a healthy diet, quit smoking (including the weed), started doing sports again (exercising twice a day 5 times a week) and also started travelling almost every month (as it took my mind off the pain, distracted and relaxed me) The pain diminished I would say by 70%. I stopped the Pantoprazole, and only continued to take the 300mg Ranitidine. I still experienced abdominal pain almost daily (not heartburn pain, rather just a dull pain just above my navel) so I thought I was on the right path.\n\nEarlier this year I went to the dentist, had a tooth filling done and then back home. I took my usual pills before bedtime (Ranitidine and Tenofovir - the hep b medication) without water. The following morning I got up with bad heartburn and a feeling a lump in throat. The following, day, however, the lump feeling in my throat turned into excruciating pain, so bad I could barely swallow my own saliva. I was referred for an endoscopy and the doc saw a bad ulcer in my mid esophagus. (although interestingly, my stomach was completely fine - no more gastritis - despite the ongoing abdominal pain) I was put on PPIs again (Pantoprazole - 80 mg/ day this time) but after 2 months the pain in my throat still didn't go away. I was also given dihydrocodeine to help me with the pain . So then my doc switched my PPIS from Pantoprazole to Esomeprazole (Nexium). He gave me 120 MG a day. After a few days taking the esomeprazole I went out and noticed my ears were ringing really bad. I thought this might be a side effect of Nexium so I went back to my doc. He told me he thinks it was just a coincidence - that the tinnitus was probably due to the loud music - and even if it was caused by Nexium it would wear off after I stopped it - but for the time being he advised me keep on the Nexium. I kept on taking the Nexium for 3 weeks without any improvement. But the tinnitus stayed. I stopped taking the Nexium and went for another endoscopy. The doc said the ulcer healed completely so there was no point in PPIs anymore.\n\nThe conclusion of the doc was that what I have is neuropathic pain, pain coming from the damaged nerves in the stomach and esophagus so now he put me on amitriptyline (30 mg/a day) but he said this would take a few weeks to work. However, this only a symptomatic treatment - to treat the nerve pain (if indeed what I have is just nerve pain)\n\nSo basically I have 3 symptoms now : abdominal dull pain, lump in my throat feeling/pain and loud tinnitus.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nCould there be any connection between the 3?\n\nI was considering doing an expensive comprehensive stool analysis test to check for additional harder to find parasite (costs about 300 pounds) Do you think that's worth it?\n\nAlso do you think the tooth fillings might have had anything to do with the symptoms or was it pure coincidence?\n\nI've been really depressed lately and I don't really know where to go anymore.

When I was younger I used to religiously pop a Zantac or Pepcid when I had symptoms for many days or, sometimes, I would take them preventatively before going out to dinner or a night of drinks. As I got older I started sporadically doing courses of 7-14 days of Prilosec b/c of the heartburn but it always felt that it was more preventative than anything as I now realize that my heartburn - although annoying - was not that bad. There may have been times I did Prilosec for months b/c my doctor may have recommended it.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, in between the short episodes of heartburn, I started developing a rash that would come and go in my arms and back. I went to doctors and they all concurred it was allergic and I had to figure out what I was allergic to. Needless to say, I cut out many things, stopped eating gluten and soy, changed soaps, shampoos, detergents, etc. Rash would still pop in every now and then. And heartburn was still around.\n\nCome my birthday earlier this year and I may have celebrated a bit too much with friends and during a trip to Las Vegas. Of course I overindulged and my heartburn really *really* flared up even though I was taking Prilosec -- now twice a day per recommendation of the doctor. And I mean this heartburn was either the kind that you have to find a place to lay down on your belly or the kind that you feel you may be having a heart attack... So I really felt like something was very wrong with me. When I had the worst episode I gave in to having an endoscopy which resulted in \"mild gastritis and esophagitis\". Doctor said: \"...keep taking Prilosec twice a day\". By this time I had given up alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate... life was pretty boring and I still had no relief. I also went to see an ENT b/c I was having episodes where I felt I could not breathe well. Of course he said to get my heartburn under control and it would go away and to ask my gastro if he could switch my meds to Protonix which I did. So that didn't make it any better... maybe it even got worse.\n\nThen, I started remembering how the day I went to have the endoscopy I was actually feeling very well (even though the previous day I had considered going to the ER b/c of the heartburn being so unbearable). The only thing different I did that day was not take any medication (Prilosec/Zantac/Protonix... nothing) b/c you have to be on an empty stomach. That day I even had delicious Vietnamese food after my endoscopy and had no pain.\n\nSo, one day I said, I'm just going to wean myself off of the heartburn meds. Slowly but surely, once I had not taken the meds for about a week the heartburn started going away. The times when it crept up I started managing it using an essential oil blend with ginger/anise/peppermint (not that I'm advocating their use... just trying to give the full picture here).\n\nI recently went on a trip again and overindulged a bit with food/drinks with friends and the next day I took a drop the essential oil blend with some water and refrained from taking any heartburn meds. All was well in a day... all back to normal.\n\nBottom line is that even though it has been only about 3 months since I stopped taking the proton inhibitors and other heartburn meds, I have not felt this well in a very long time and I think it was worthwhile trying to let my body heal on its own.\n\nHope this is helpful to some.","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Prilosec/Protonix + Zantac/Pepcid made my heartburn worse (and more)","resp_content":"PS - and the rash is gone\n"},{"author":"calonga","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Prilosec/Protonix + Zantac/Pepcid made my heartburn worse (and more)","resp_content":"Did you also try Pepcid during your times of taking meds?

Had some questions.","resp_content":"I was diagnosed with IBS back in 1982. I'd gone in to find out why I was having so many problems with intestinal pain, diarrhea and constipation. Nothing I tried to regulate my bathroom habits worked but the pain was consistant and kept getting worse. This had been going on since high school because of the way my Mom use to feed us with very little money for groceries. Back then they didn't have the advanced testing they have now and I had to have a barrium enema with x-rays. Afterwards it took me three times to expell all of the barrium. The physician told me that if I didn't get rid of it all, it would harden my intestinal tract, which was all I needed with everything else. His assistant got mad at me because it took me three times to get rid of it but I felt that was her problem.\n\nIn 2005, I had an endoscopy done and found out that I also have Barrett's Esophageal. Heart burn, acid reflex, and just general stomach upset was a way of life. Most of which was caused by anything greasy, including margarine and butter. I would be throwing up the grease but the food would stay down. My Mom blamed it on my gallbladder. I had my gallbladder taken out in 2009 which improved the problem slightly but the problem persisted.\n\nThe problems was compounded in the fall of 1988 when I had to change scrubs while working in a hospital in very little room to change. The first of what I called \"abdominal spasms\" started. Between then and 2008, the spasms got so bad they occured on a daily basis multiple times. I could not stand, sit, or lay down without having them. Anything would cause them to start, coughing, breathing, moving wrong or whatever. I seen over 30 physicians for this problem and none of them had a clue of what was going on. After the 10th physician, they started telling me it was all in my head. I kept telling them that I didn't know what head was located in my abdominal area right under the right side of my rib cage. Some of them were trying different medication like lyrica, one thought that I had fibromialgia which I don't have. Come to find out, what happened then was because of the small space I had to change in, it pinched some nerves around my intestinal track right under my rib cage and folded the tip end of my right lung under itself.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, they hospitalized me and did a battery of tests, by the time they got done with me, I felt like a punching bag. But a lot of what happened in 1988 had undone itself but the pinched nerves will never go away.\n\nThe primary physician I now have, I started seeing approximately 5 years ago. All I had to do was explain to him the symtoms I was having along with all of the tests that had been done being all in one location. The first thing he did was put me on gemfibrozil and amitriptyline. I started taking the gemfibrozil first, it didn't bother me any. Within the first two weeks after starting the amitriptyline, it made my legs want to start dancing in bed whenever I'd go to bed. This happened no matter when I took it, 6:00 am or 6:00 pm, and I'd go to bed at midnight, I'd still be dancing in bed. The amitriptyline had to go. I quit take the amitriptyline but kept taking the gemfibrozil. I told my pcp (primary care physician) what happened, he then switched it to nortriptyline. They are both in the same drug classification but amitriptyline has more side effects.\n\nThe combination of the gemfibrozil and the nortriptyline are a God send for me. The intestinal spasms have all but disappeared. I only have them maybe once or twice a month now at the most.\n2\n"},{"author":"ellen0610","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"It's just a matter of finding the right primary care physician with the right expertise.","resp_content":"1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/4354/just-received-my-biopsy-report-today-had-some-questions"},{"post":{"author":"magsthegrey","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"GERD/Acid Reflux Peoples.....","post_content":"Has anyone ever experienced coughing up clear phlegm (for me, it's mostly in the morning, but not always) ?

PLEASE read/help","post_content":"I have a really long story & complicated medical history, but I'm going to keep things short & to the point as to not turn people away. I am so desperate for an answer.\n\nI'm a 25 year old female who has been having a myriad of gastrointestinal issues for the last almost two years. During the summer of 2016 I had my first bout with severe diarrhea, which I honestly thought originated from food poisoning. Obviously this was not the case as this symptom and (new ones to follow) has become pervasive in my life. Here are my symptoms as well as diagnoses/treatments/procedures mentioned as they occurred chronologically.\n-I have been having mouth sores since I was in elementary school. During high school & then college years they progressed.\n-July 2014: Heart palpitations began SUDDENLY. They lasted for 24/7 for five months straight. EKG normal. I was severely underweight at this time & advised to gain weight, which should resolve symptoms. They eventually subsided, but would come back suddenly & randomly, lasting for short periods of time.\n-Diagnosed with a gluten intolerance November 2014 - began a GF diet, which I still adhere to now.\n-Mouth sores went away for maybe a year and then reappeared worse than before.\n- Summer of 2016: GI issues, namely - bloating, cramping, lower abdominal pain (esp. right quadrant), frequent watery diarrhea, inability to \"wait\" to use the bathroom, weight loss.\n-September 2016: Heart palpitations resumed. First referral to Cardiologist & Gastroenterologist. Full cardiac work-up (EKG, Echo, Stress Test, 24-hr holter monitor) normal.\n-Diagnosed with GERD by GI doctor. Began omeprazole 20 mg daily.\n-Feb. 2017 Follow up with GI scheduled upper GI endo as symptoms did not resolve.\n-March 10, 2017 Endoscopy with six biopsies negative for Celiac disease. Evidence of gastritis was diagnosis.\n-Began having bloody diarrhea and weight loss again. Colonoscopy performed May 3rd, 2017. Negative for microscopic colitis.\n-June 2017: Pillcamera was negative for Celiac. Showed delayed transit.\n-August 1, 2017 diagnosed with IBS.\nThe same symptoms persisted. I stopped visiting this GI doctor because he didn't test biopsies for Crohn's like I had asked & I know IBS does NOT cause bleeding. I disagree with this dx.\n-October 2017: diagnosed with Sicca (Dry eye) & eye inflammation.\n-Rheumatology visit in October 2017 wherein I had genetic blood testing. I was found to have a positive HLA-B27 & two mutations of NOD2/CARD15/IBD1. Also found to be severely iron deficient.\n-November 30, 2017: Diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Started Celebrex 2x daily. Sulfasalazine recommended, but I have not taken it.\n-February 2017: Saw new GI doctor. Upped my dosage of Omeprazole to 40mg daily when it failed to work anymore.\n-April 2017: x-ray of abdomen revealed what appears to be constipation. I can't imagine how I could have such horrible diarrhea with this. Also revealed Kidney stone. Sonogram revealed tumor in kidney believed to be angiomyolipoma. I am currently following up with a Nephrologist.\n\nThis is where I am at currently. As we speak, I have two ulcers in my mouth. These are the third & fourth ulcers I have had in about four weeks, one of which took up nearly half of my tongue & caused such severe swelling. I am in sheer agony & cannot eat, chew, and struggle to talk. I am at the end of my rope.\n\nMy main issues right now are severe diarrhea, sometimes bloody, usually always yellow in color (it is reminiscent to me of when I was doing the bowel prep for my colonoscopy), severe bloating wherein my pants cannot be buttoned, oral ulcers, heart palpitations, severe fatigue, shortness of breath upon exertion - I cannot use the stairs, frequent urination. I am so spent. I seriously cannot live like this anymore. I know something is wrong with me.\n\nAnyone have similar experience? Please, please share. I can't stress how badly I want answers. I almost don't even care what they are anymore.\n\nMy guess is Crohn's. They just can't seem to find it, but I know it can take years to diagnose. My genetic profile suggests Crohn's as NOD2 is also called IBD1 (Inflammatory Bowel Disease). I know oral ulcers are a manifestation of Crohn's & I've had mine swabbed for herpes, infectious disease, etc. all negative.

I have gone through an endoscopy, and a colonoscopy. MY DX was Candida overgrowth in stomach, bowels. I was told to follow a gerd diet. Does not work, this is the 3rd year of suffering,with a final dx being all of the above. I have rashes on my body,that smell sweet,or like yeast when they break. No DR. will treat. I found on google, if you get 30 days of diflucan,along with 30 days of an anti-viral, a medication to help liver maintain,plus a strict diet will help all go away. All Dr.'s say it is normal to have this within your body. I am suffering with a weight loss, of 45 pounds in a 18 month period,bloating is so bad i look 8 months pregnant after a meal. Rashes are itchy,and rather embarrassing when i have to work. The stools are generally so hard is takes days to go, then it is pure water.

PLEASE read/help","resp_content":"Hello Kate0323\nI am sorry for what you are going through, and that you have no diagnosis yet.\nLet me make the following points:\n- If a patient with celiac disease is on a gluten-free diet, biopsies are unlikely to show the usually expected intestinal pathology- essential for diagnosis, of celiac disease to start with, as there would be no more evidence to mucosal flattening. That means, the repeat biopsies for celiac, though negative, do not rule it out in principle, regardless of whether you do have celiac or not.\n-A v strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is crucial for prevention of symptom recurrence; could you have been exposed inadvertently to some veiled gluten source, so your symptoms reappeared?! Yet, I do not claim you have celiac for sure, but if truly there, the vitamin and iron deficiencies it incurs, does explain your heart symptoms, fatigue, etc.\n- Yes, IBS does not inherently cause bleeding; however, patients, like normal people, can be exposed to infections-ex a parasite called E. histolytica, which causes yellowish and bloody diarrhea, tenesmus( defectaion urgency), besides bloating and pain, and anemia. That can be detected by stool analysis. Bacterial infections also my cause such symptoms, and can be diagnosed by stool cultures.\n- Use of omeprazole, especially upping it, is not warranted, and even rather contraindicated in your case. Your “GE” reflux is secondary to your initial pathology, not primary, so it will resolve once your primary condition is diagnosed and treated. More, omeprazole causes heart and kidney problems, and iron, calcium, magnesium, and most seriously vitaminB12 deficiency, adding to your issues, and increases risk of clostridium difficile infection-that could explain secondarily your symptoms, and needs to be ruled out.\n- I do not believe taking Celebrex at this point has more benefits than harm, given your complicated bowel issues are not resolved. You can judge the cruciality of its use once your digestive health is regained.\n-Crohn’s, which you have a genetic predisposition for, should be diagnosed by endoscopy and biopsy, and so should be its cousin-ulcerative colitis which produces similar symptoms. That should be accurately addressed and accurately ruled out, or in. Mind you, having the gene predisposes for a disease but not inevitably, as environment plays a major role, which brings me to the final point below.\n-Do you eat healthy( grains, fiber, no-sugar), to start with, if not, excessive unhealthy bacteria, can cause your symptoms, and predispose to secondary infections. You could have started with a minor problem that drove a viciou cycle.\nThat is in brief. Take care, and you may keep me posted.\nDr Hana Fayyad\nMaria Jasmine Freeman\n1\n"},{"author":"thegirlwithkeidoscopeeyes","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: What could this possibly be?

The need to go to the toilet doesn't come gradually, it comes intensely and suddenly often resulting in near misses and even after going to the toilet my bowels still feel full.

Much like the issue with my bowels this also results in me smelling bad if I've sat in my clothes for too long, I'm having to change my underwear a few times a day to avoid smelling of urine. I've been to my doctor about this and he gave me 3 days of anti-biotics in case it was an infection but they didn't seem to work.\n\nI've asked my family members out right if I smell dirty and they say I smell fine, but the people saying I smell fine are the ones that are covering their noses when I'm around, I often catch my brother sniffing me when I'm walking past him or something but when I ask if I smell he says no.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything similar to this and had a diagnosis?

One thing they did manage to provide me with was a CBC and a few other labs I asked for, which showed I'm anemic, lymphs were nicely elevated and my AST was sky high at 110 with my ALT sitting perfect. Might i add, all of my general abdominal pain started after I went from 270lb to 175lb in 8 months just from working out with a stupid, very malnourished diet.\nI grew very wary with the extreme ignorance of the doctors I visited (all seemed to think I was out to get their precious drugs :) so I started researching home remedies, not the greatest move for someone that didn't know anything about what was going on with my body at the time, ill admit. But I did it anyways and one of the first things I did was the famous liver/gallblader flush. It worked, and was pleased with the results of what i passed and how I felt afterwords, so I did a few more flushes within a couple month period. Well i ran into a problem a couple flushes before my last, a problem all liver flushers fear, a stone got stuck right were a duct empties into the stomach. I followed with 2 flushes and passed the mothership of stones, followed by several bowel movements of just stones.\nSince then I've chilled out with home remedies and have gotten better insurance and a proper referral to one of the best gastroenterologist in my area which I can't see till May 23rd. The problem is i have a mass growing since the flushing incident, approximately 3\" below my sternum (first person viewing), positioned 1/8\" to the right of the rectus abdomens downward line. The mass is about the size of a quarter, soft but not lipomas soft and seems spherically shaped. The mass is manageable painwise , only when I don't eat proper and consistently does it get out of control. My stomach also tends to hold onto food far longer then its suppose to, which sometimes results in me feeling like my blood sugar is dropping, shaky, cold sweats, etc...not sure if this related to the mass or not.\n\nSorry for long post but wanted to be as thorough as possible.\n\nThank you\nChris","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn","IBD","Crohn's Disease","Ulcers","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Bloating","Ulcerative Colitis","Constipation"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/52969/growing-at-times-painful-mass-3-inches-bellow-sternum"},{"post":{"author":"jamescurryy","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Eating Disorder with strange symptoms","post_content":"Hi there, I am completely lost on what to do in my life regarding this situation I find myself in, I am a 22 year old male who has never had any serious issues in life, has always been happy, have a great job loads of friends and family etc, basically the 'perfect' life up until recently.

About 28 years ago he was in a car accident and had to have surgery on both intestines to have them repaired after they were ripped (he also broke his hip in 5 places). He had to have surgery again about 8-10 years ago after they ripped at home (scar tissue) and he was septic. So from time to time since, he'll move wrong or something and basically will be stuck in bed for days. Sometimes he can't even get up to go to the bathroom. For about the last month he's been complaining of pain and it's gotten even more severe over the last week, with a few days where again he couldn't get out of bed. I took him to the ER yesterday (no insurance, so can't see a primary care doctor) and they basically laughed in our faces and said it was just muscle spasms. They wouldn't listen when we told them that it's a pre-existing condition that he has had surgery for at that same hospital. They gave him muscle relaxers and sent us home. The only \"exam\" they did was push on both his belly and back at the same time. I don't think it's just muscle spasms, and we can't afford to go anywhere else, so I was wondering if anyone could help with what's going on?\n\nHe says the pain is a sharp, stabbing pain. Usually in the area of his kidneys but it moves around to the front sometimes. He also said it alternates sides. Sometimes the pain is down in his hips/groin area. It does not hurt to pee and he doesn't have any trouble going to the bathroom (assuming he can get out of bed). Sometimes he can't lift his legs and it hurts a lot to move his hips. He doesn't have any trouble eating, no fever either. Laying down is the best relief.\n\nI understand that it could be muscle spasms. I'm just concerned that it actually is coming from his intestines and not just muscles. He was septic before and almost died, but I don't feel like any doctor we have seen takes him seriously. He's otherwise in good health - no drugs or smoking. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what we could/should do or what it could be?

I'm new to the idea of joining online communities, but I'm game for anything that helps encourage and inspire others. A friend of mine actually suggested that I get out there (web) and tell my story. In July of 2017 I weighed 267 pounds. I had problems with brain fog, depression, asthma, vit D deficiency, GERD, and was diagnosed with IBS with inflammation. It was like I was waking up in the wrong body every day and trying to figure out how to get back to being me. My gastroenterologist recommended that I try the Low FODMAP diet and report back to her after 3 weeks to discuss possible solutions. During this elimination phase I completely dumped all Soy, Dairy, Wheat, Gluten, HFCS, Garlic, Onions, and Sugar Alcohols. This isn't a complete list, but these were the biggies! I didn't realize how addictive the substances were in the foods I was consuming or what they were doing to my body! For 3 weeks I went through food withdrawals, mood swings, and just felt like a total crazy lady! But, once my body detoxed from all that stuff, something amazing happened! I felt 10 years younger, had more energy, was able to reduce most of my meds, the brain fog was gone, and smaller meals filled me up faster. One of the things I learned was that HFCS is highly addictive and is designed to shut off your \"full switch\" in your brain. Now, my body's metabolism has reset! I've dropped down from a size 24 to size 14/15. I've dropped 58 lbs so far! Yesterday I weighed myself and was down to 209! My goal weight is 150. When I reach my goal weight I'm going to reward myself with a mommy make-over and full-body tuck, since my weight loss will be more than 100lbs. Last November, I plateaued around 40lbs of weight lost. That's when I discovered Arbonne! Arbonne's healthy living program has helped me lose 18 more pounds and continues to help me steadily lose 1 to 2 pounds every week! I drink meal replacement shakes for breakfast and lunch. My shakes taste amazing - are soy free, dairy free, Organic, Kosher, Vegan, and NonGMO certified. I loved them so much that I actually joined the company to help others experience the same life changing results that I had experienced, and to get the discount, lol! You guys, I don't care if you buy Arbonne from me or somebody else, but please! Do yourself a favor and try it! I guarantee you wi not be dissatisfied.

Your initial pain has resolved on omeprazole, now you have bloating, occasional loss of appetite, and some odd stomach feelings. You don't mention any weight loss. Are you overthinking this? Probably. Having said that, if you have any significant change in your GI symptoms, report them to your doctor. The fact that you are waiting two months for the endoscopy tells me that your doctor doesn't find an urgent need for the test.\n\nIn the meantime, you could try a restrictive diet for awhile to see if that helps your symptoms. I've been on medications like omeprazole for 30 years and most recently was on 80mg a day of omeprazole. I've had every scope, BMI down to 18, pain, heartburn, cramps, bloating, no real answers. Now I'm on a plant based diet, occasionally eat fish, eggs, grilled skinless white chicken, but I stopped the omeprazole a year ago and I no longer have any symptoms. It may be worth a try. Start plant based until your body is detoxed, then add in a few reasonable foods you can't live without, one food at a time to see how your body reacts. Medical doctors don't always evaluate dietary causes of GI issues so it's up to you. Medications like omeprazole are harmful when used long term, something I was not aware of until recently.\n\nStress can also affect GI symptoms. You could try yoga, meditation, mindfulness, exercise, or talk therapy.\n\nGood luck!

Stabbing pain, top right of the stomach lasts from 7PM - 7AM (with early symptoms starting around 4-5, weird taste in my mouth.) I take extremely hot baths, rock my body, rub my feet, sit with a heating pad until I pass out from exhaustion.

And about once every 3-4 months this happens.\n\nWhat I think is happening and maybe there is a reason why is this. My body is not digesting food as normal stomachs would. When I have these \"Stomach episodes\" I will force myself to vomit (ONLY during these episodes do I self-purge.) What I have noticed when purging is that the food I have eaten from the morning is still solid. **when I get the early symptoms I stop any and all food intake for that day.**\n\nI have been to doctors, I have been tested and scoped.

I am 22 years old, female. 6 months ago I presented symptoms that included CONSTANT stomach pain, up to 10 bathroom trips a day, very inconsistent stool(mostly loose) nausea/vomiting, and I have lost 40lbs in this time frame, unintentionally.\nMy doctor couldn't beleive that at my age I lost that much weight that rapidly. I underwent a colonsocopy and endoscopy. They took 10+ biopsies. The pictures present imflammation and white patches. My histology report is troubling me, so maybe somebody could give me some insight if they had the same experience.\nA. Terminal Ileum -- Histologic sections show small intestinal mucosa with tall villi lined by columnar absorptive cells and interspered mucin secreting goblet cells. The epithelium overlies nodules of lymphoid tissue within the mucosa and submucosa. There is no significant acute inflammation or granulomas.\nB. Random Colon(He said my entire colon had all this in it) --Histologic sections show colonic mucosa with vertically oriented crypts resting on the muscularis mucosae. The surface epithelium is composed of columnar cells and goblet cells. The delicate lamina propria is edematous and contains modest population of mononuclear cells, including lympocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. An occasional lymphoid aggregate is also noted.\nC. Duodenum -- Histologic sections show duodenal mucosa with preserved villi lined by columnar cells and goblet cells. The lamina propria contains some inflammatory cells.\nD. Stomach, Antrum -- I was found to have mild chronic active gastritis and positive for helicobacter pylori organisms.\nHistologic sections reveal gastic mucosa with increased infilintrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells within the lamina propria. There is focal neutrophilic infiltration of foveola epitheliem.\n\nAll biopsies came back negative for dysplasia and malignancy, Praise God.\n\nMy problem is, the helicobater pylori diagnosis. I have been drinking the same tap water for years. Nobody else in my family is affected. I've had it before and I was very tempormental and treated with antibiotics. No big deal. I've done some research and it ranges from IBS, Ulcerative Colitis, Chrone's, to nothing(which would make no sense considering im only 22 and lost 40lbs) Id like to note I have severe anxiety/depression and have been screened on eating disorders and my thyroid doctor ran a full endocrine test so my thyroid isn't to blame. I stuff my face every day trrying to gain weight, just for it to run through me. During prep day for my colonoscopy, it was like an average day for me. The drinks ran through me within an hour, like everything else I ingest.\nThe notes of inflamation and immune cells has me questioning things. I follow up with my specialist August 1 and it seems like forever away.\nI have had to apply for disability at 22, because I was fired because my boss didn't think I was \"mentally capable of working.\" My anxiety has been high during this time, and running to and from the bathroom all day at work landed me jobless. I am staying home with my 1 year old now(which is a job technically, but my income was needed.) I am ashamed to admit I am very prideful for my age and disability seems like the easy way out, but at this point in my life, I don't have a choice. My anxiety and depression became \"unhandled\" once the weight started falling off, as if they werent as effective or something. I'm sitting at home crying most of the time, and running to and from the bathroom while trying to be a good attentive mother. I am struggling to stay above 100lbs, and not being dramatic(even though im a 22 year old girl hehe) I truly feel like im withering away. Every day I have less and less energy. The histology report has me very discouraged because it doesn't seem like anything was found. Has anybody on here had the same case, or similiar and received a diagnosis? Or is there a GI on here that could give some insight? I would greatly apprecate it.","like_count":"1","tags":["IBD","Crohn's Disease","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Ulcerative Colitis"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Can You Help Make Sense of my Path.

As my title suggests I'm having trouble with blood in my stool. For the past three days I've been having bright red blood in my stool without any kind of discomfort such as cramping or fissures. I feel no pain during the day and it feels completely normal. The first two days I had very hard stools so I thought I was just cramping because of that, and yesterday I had a bit of pain from straining but it only lasted an hour afterwords. Today I made sure to drink a lot of water so as to see if that was the problem and the stool I passed today (I drink coffee daily so I have an almost daily BM) was loose, but still bright red. I felt completely normal passing it.\nSome important things to note, recently I had my very first vaginal yeast infection and took Monistat 3 for it. On the second day after my first dose is when the problem started. I've been off Monistat for almost two days now and my infection is cleared up. Another thing is that yesterday I had a 'perceived' migraine with a mild tension headache, 'pins-and-needles' skin sensitivity mostly in my arms, and mild nausea. I took some Anacin (2 capsules, I've taken it before and haven't gotten any bad side effects). I lied down for a few hours and mostly got rid of it and woke up this morning with only the skin sensitivity and kind of an 'echo' of the headache and nausea. I took a dose of Anacin as well about 15 hours after my first dose to help with the 'postdrome'.\nSometime after my BM today I felt somewhat tight in my chest (more like my stomach feels a bit too full, not bloated, and my gut feels too empty). Within the last hour and a half I've eaten a lot of Fudge Stripes (they're very addictive), and about seven hours ago I had a salad for lunch. My diet and the things I've eaten recently always go down very well with me. Another thing to note is that I have been undergoing a high-stress situation where one of my caretakers is in the hospital and I am left to take care of the house, and just today I have started back school and it has been mentally grueling for me. I'm preparing a mild meal now to see if I can eat a bit. However I try I can't seem to relax. Maybe it's because of the Anacin, because the caffeine effect of it lasts a few hours for me, or because of my high anxiety and stress.\nSo, what do you think? Could the blood today just be leftover from the strain/medication from the past few days? Do I have cancer (this is WebMD after all)? I have no symptoms of blood loss (lightheadedness, pale skin, etc.) Should I see a doctor or talk to a caretaker?\n\nThank you for your time.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/48926/14-year-old-female-blood-in-stool-without-discomfort"},{"post":{"author":"mads456","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Low FODMAP didn’t work, now what??","post_content":"I have has stomach issues for years but now that I’m in my early 20s it’s getting worse.

I have the same issues and after 9 years of tests, elimination diets, and removal of gallbladder, I was diagnosed with IBS-D. I am on a medicine currently that sometimes works but I am still finding out which foods affect me the most and eliminating them from my diet. So far my triggers seem to be coffee, STRESS, NEW SITUATIONS AND CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE, milk and milk products even lactose free milk, fried and spicy foods, and cucumbers. My previous GI doctor refused to acknowledge that I could have IBS-D so I referred myself to a new GI doctor and he said I was pretty much a text boom diagnosis and I have it pretty severe. I need to be on a strong medicine but my insurance doesn’t cover it and it would cost me $800 per month! So the battle is ever going. I feel your pain and completely understand the anxiety of avoiding social situations but tell your friends, they will understand. Plus, I still take Imodium before going out of town each time because I know what will happen. It seems to help. But be careful taking it too much!

I found medications did not work. For me the solution was one of following a gluten free diet. It’s difficult at first, but once you start feeling well again you’ll find that it’s worth the effort and going without eating gluten will make you feel normal once more. I now avoid all packaged processed foods; ie: no boxed cereal, canned foods, instant foods. I eat only fresh meats/fish, fresh veggies and fruit and homemade foods; GF frozen pie crust with fresh fruit, do not eat white/wheat flour or any foods that contain wheat or have been made thicker with flour. No packaged cookies, pies, cakes, etc. It takes longer to prepare but well worth eliminating pain, diarrhea, etc. No fast food. There are excellent cookbooks for preparing gluten-free foods, and books about foods to eat and those to avoid. You will be surprised to learn how the majority of prepared/restaurant foods contain gluten which destroys the gut lining. An excellent brand of GF bread, pastries that you can buy in frozen-food aisle of most grocery stores is “Canyon Bakehouse” of Colorado. The only way to stay well once you are back to health is to follow this way of eating from this day on. I tried to cheat at first, but had to return to this way of eating permanently. There are even many restaurants that are now offering GF menus for those with this problem. I’m totally used to eating this way and no longer have the urge to cheat...totally not worth the pain and problems and embarrassment that are created by this disorder. There is much good information on internet as well by doctors who specialize in treating it, such as Dr. Tom O’Brian, Dr Hyman, etc.\n\nI wish you well and encourage you to read all you can to stay on this eating plan. I assure you that you will be so happy to feel healthy and normal again that you will find it easier to stick with it as time goes on .\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"I agree with the article above , clean eating .

Should I also consult Gastroenterologist?\n\n-Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups.\n\nFew doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms.\n\n********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? **********\n\n\nI wonder now why no doctor asked to check his \"cortisol\" range?

You may need temporary digestive aids to get you back on track depending on what you have taken recently. In the mean time, avoid fried foods and very fatty foods to see if that helps.

And, it looks like from the other responses in this chain, you’re not the only one with problems after gall bladder surgery. While it can take people a while to get back to a normal diet, you shouldn't be in so much discomfort that you’re only eating once a day and losing weight. That’s concerning to me. Please get a second opinion from a gastroenterologist.\nWhat you describe may be postcholecystectomy syndrome. It occurs in about 10-15% of people after gall bladder surgery. The term applies to people who have symptoms after a cholecystectomy regardless of why. It could be continued problems related to your gall bladder, or it could be from other issues that that developed after the surgery. If you can, get medical records of the surgery you had and the tests you’ve had done to take to the doctor.\nGood luck!

Yesterday i got diagnosed with Mensenteric Lymphadenitis, which is where they done a CT scan on my abdomen with contrast (which was the most weird feeling ever like an extreme hot flash for a good 2minutes) and found out my lymph nodes in my stomach are enlarged which has inflamed my intestines. I was sent home on a strict clear liquid diet & nausea medicine (zeflon) & antibiotic (Keflex) because my blood work come back with my white blood cell count low at 4000 when they told me it should be around 10,000.

Ive always had a clean bill of health besides my breathing problems with asthma and having to take Pulmonary Function Tests every 3 months. They're not sure where this bacterial infection has come from or what it is. I feel like i do not have enough answers.

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better?

I have resorted to webmd for a long time to search for minor medical advice as this site seems to be the most reputable and professional. That said this is my first post. I recently lost my job/insurance and shortly after have had some very scary things going on. I would appreciate any input! I apologize for the length but hopefully it will shed some light for anyone that can offer advice.\nA little about me... I have always been overall pretty healthy. I played sports my whole life. I am 35 years old 6’2” about 265lbs (I gained a lot of weight the past 8 months). I do have 4 herniated discs, 3 bulges, DDD, a forget the professional term but narrowing of the spine, sciatica obviously happens, arthritis in my back and there are a couple other things I am forgetting. That said I don’t have as much pain as one would think. I do smoke which I am embarrassed to say and actively trying to quit. I also probably drink more than I should. Outside of the issues I am desperately seeking advice for I have been very depressed due to losing my job, family members with cancer, going through a divorce and so on. I am not seeking pitty I just want to do my best to give as detail as I can that may be a link to my issue.\n\nI’ll start by trying to describe my day from the beginning.\nI wake up every morning hacking and coughing very badly. There is often blood in the mucus I cough up.\nShortly after waking up I will begin hacking/choking so badly that I will vomit for a couple minutes and sometimes I’ll vomit again throughout the day. The vomit usually looks like a lot of phlegm (a lot) but at times is like green or yellow.\nThroughout the day I cough and hack badly. When I cough there is often blood when I spit.\nI get very nauseated a few times throughout the day.\nThere are times during the day I feel light headed and almost like it’s slightly hard to breath. This seems like anxiety to me.\n\nAbout 2 months ago I was having very bad migraines (which I have never experienced and was nothing short of horrible) that would wake me up every night for 4-6 months. Not sure if this could be linked. I haven’t had a migraine or headache for a few weeks until recently having bad headaches.\n\nI apologize for any typos/poor grammar and the length of my post.

Most of the other issues seem to have passed, but I'm still left with this one: Moderate pain on the lower right side of my stomach when sleeping on my right side.\n\nThis all started with a worsening of my reflux symptoms (which I've had on and off for at least the last 10 years or so). Terrible heart burn, lot of bloating, gurgling stomach sounds and lower right abdomen pain. Few days after the reflux went nuts, I also developed a diarrhea and low grade fever jumping between 37.5 - 38 Celcius (99.5 - 100.5 Fahrenheit).\n\nAt that point, I went to a doctor and had some blood work done plus was tested for Helicobacter pylori. All came back normal (and negative for h. pylori). After physical exam, history and the test results, doctor gave me the diagnosis of IBS.\n\nFast forward to this day. The good part is, my reflux and other stomach problems seem to be \"ok\" now, but I'm still left with this weird problem at night time. Like said, the pain only comes to surface when I'm laying on my right side in bed. When I switch my sleeping position to sleeping on back or on my right side, the pain disappears. The pain is always on the same place, right lower quadrant of my stomach. I believe it's right about the same place where appendix is.\n\nThe pain is almost always accompanied with gas and if I press on the spot where it hurts, there are audible gurgling sounds present.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n- Does anyone else experience the same thing (whether you have IBS or not)?\n- And if you do, have you (or your doctor) been able to figure out what's causing it?\n- Is there something that I can try to make it go away?\n\nI'm just clueless as to why this is happening now, because for the past 36 years, I certainly have not experienced this before.

I also had extremely sudden urges. My stool was very loose and when I didn’t use it I would cramp up. Each time I did use the bathroom there would be blood as well. As time went on I visited a specialist and I took a blood and stool test. They said that i have high liver enzymes and had lost weight. Right now I am 95 lbs.

It all started when I was 18 years old graduating from high school. I began to have abdominal pain and minor bouts of diarrhea. I thought it was just a virus or just going through a phase, but after a month I had enough and went in to see a gastroenterologist. I had blood tests run, an ultrasound of my adbdomen, and finally a colonoscopy. After all the tests my doctor said that I had “minor” IBS and that I would be fine. After speaking with the doctor I felt better knowing that I would be fine but in the back of my head I knew something was not right.\nI went off to college for 5 years and the symptoms continued to get worse and worse, I saw a few other doctors along the way and they said that it is just the IBS you are “fine” just cut back on drinking and eating junk food/bad food. It got to the point towards the end of college where if I went out drinking than I would have extreme pain in the abdomen area/bad diarrhea so I began to cut back on the drinking and bad foods. Also my stools slowly started to become loose. I began to just not be myself and I knew something was wrong in the back of my head. But what more could I do besides a colonoscopy? I also started to experience frequent urination that got worse over time and also muscle spasms and heart palpitations that also got worse. My doctor said it was just “stress” and told me to cut back on any caffeine you may be consuming.\nThese symptoms progressively got worse over time but I was still able to live a moderately normal life until one day about a year after I graduated from college. At about 1:00AM in the morning I remember waking up from sleeping on the couch and quickly walking to bed. As soon as I laid down on my stomach I suddenly felt very light headed and queezy. I got very faint, my heart rate shot to what felt like 150bpm, I was sweating profusely, had scary heart palpitations, and I thought this was it my life was ending tonight. I got very close to passing out but never lost consciousness. My girlfriend at the time rushed me to the hospital and they did blood work and a cat scan of my head. I spent about half the night there and at the end of it the doctor said that I was free to leave and thought it was probably stress that triggered it and gave me no explanation. After that day I started noticing awful reactions to certain foods like sugar, white carbs, alcohol, eating excessively, and even exercise. I was having awful heart palpitations, feeling dizzy, was not able to think clearly, my lymph nodes became swollen and would get worse after eating the above referenced foods, and my heart would randomly jump to 130-15bpm. I got random bouts of dizziness after changing elevations quickly.\nOne day for lunch at work about a week after the first trip to the ER I consumed one single beer and immediately I started feeling dizzy and wound up going to the emergency room again that night. The same symptoms as the first trip to the ER happened and the doctor ended up saying basically the same thing. By the way it has been about a year since that second trip to the ER and I have not had a single drink since then. Shortly after the first trip to the ER I began seeing several doctors. The first doctor I saw was my general practitioner. He did extensive blood work and said everything looked normal and that it was probably stress and he recommended me to a cardiologist, endocrinologist, and even a psychologist! The second one I saw was a cardiologist in which I had a stress test done, several EKG’s, too much blood work, and also an ultrasound of my heart. Everything checked out fine and he said it was probably just “stress” you were experiencing and that you just need to relax. I proceeded to see another cardiologist and had the same tests done in which he told me that it was again just stress and that I was fine. Now I moved on to see two endocrinologists in which I did all the blood work in the world it felt like. I got tested for thyroid problems and everything and I got the same response from all the other doctors. I proceeded to see a gastroenterologist where he did extensive blood work and tested for chrons, any inflammation and various other diseases. I told him everything and he literally told me to take pepto bismol and that I was fine. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. At this point all I wanted was a doctor to give me some concrete answers and tell me something besides stress is causing all of this. On to another gastroenterologist. I went to the Medical Center in Houston, TX one of the best hopitals in the country. They did a stool sample, a cat scan of my abdomen, and extensive blood work. After all those tests they said everything was normal and that you’re symptoms were over a broad range of organ systems so they basically could not give me any answers. I have seen 7 doctors in 3 months at this point but hey who is counting. After eating anything at this point I just don’t feel right. My symptoms after seeing the 7th doctor include: heart palpitations, muscle spasms, swollen lymph nodes(gets worse after eating), tight chest(gets after eating), loose stools, occasional diarrhea, brain fog, loss of appetite, constipation, dizziness after sudden elevation changes, sleep loss, ringing in ears, and loss of weight. I went from being 175 pounds to 140 pounds without even trying. All of these symptoms get worse after eating, especially after sugar, junk food, starches, and alcohol. The only thing that made me feel slightly better was keeping an extremely strict diet. The more I researched the more I thought that this was a gastro related nervous system disorder so I saw a neurologist and he said that the gut is lined by the nervous system and that I had an extremely over reactive gut. He prescribed me clonazepam’s and said this would help calm my gut. I thought this was the last thing I wanted because I thought it would probably make me worse or it would just be a band-aid and not cover the real issues at hand. Nonetheless I took them for a few weeks to just try and keep sane because I was desperate and then got off of them quickly. They did not solve any real problems.\nIt has been almost a year now since that first trip to the emergency room and my symptoms have gotten slightly better but they are still there and the only things that have helped me has been to keep an extremely strict diet. Right not all I want is some answers. I try hard to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it is extremely hard and I get really down on myself. All of my friends seem so happy and healthy and I cannot say the same for myself. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? This is not stress or IBS we are talking about here.

I am, more than a month later, still suffering pain in my stomach, gas, burping, constipation or loose stools, and lack of feeling in my anal area, I have had cortisone shots in my sacroiliac for years with no side effects.

That's because probiotics help reduce diarrhea and diarrhea is a very common side effect of taking antibiotics. The probiotics are also helpful in alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These symptoms include bloating, constipation and gas, but a cup of yogurt a day can keep patients regular. Speaking of antibiotics, ladies you are already warned about their harmful effect on your vagina's delicate environment. Birth control pills have the same effect, but if you are prone to yeast infections or UTIs (urinary tract infections), you may start adding more probiotics to your diet, as preliminary research show they help with these issues as well.\n\nYou probably know already that yogurt is one of the most recommended foods when keeping a diet. Preliminary research shows that probiotics can help obese patients maintain weight loss after they have had weight loss surgery. More so, mothers can also benefit from probiotics, which assist them to reduce the waist circumference post-partum.\n\nRecent research also suggests that probiotics help in lowering the cholesterol, thus contributing to reduce blood pressure and avoid further health problems. Speaking of heart disease, did you know that poor oral hygiene is associated with heart problems and a host of other issues? But don't worry. Probiotics also help you keep your pearly whites in good shape. A certain strain of probiotics kills the bacteria which causes tooth decay and also helps lessen the effects of gingivitis.\n\nIf you have already probiotics to your diet, you may have noticed that you are less prone to get sick every time the season's change (or the wind blows). Research shows that one of the benefits of probiotics is reducing the upper respiratory infections.\n\nSince I first discovered the true power of probiotics some time ago, I feel excellent, and it is my duty to spread the word.\n\nSome helpful sources:\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/what-are-probiotics\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC207122/\nhttps://www.hlbenefits.com/best-probiotic-foods-review/","like_count":"0","tags":["Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Bloating","Constipation"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: I managed to alleviate most of the digestive-related symphtoms by usind probiotics","resp_content":"The thing is that you can promote any idea any ideology any diet in Instagram and get your audince.

I have been on 40 mg Nexium since 5/2017 for GERD and LPR. I started slowly cutting down November 2017. I am currently on 30 mg Nexium and really struggling. I don’t have heartburn or voice issues again, but I have a dull ache between my shoulder blades. It has gotten worse and worse the more I cut down on the Nexium. Sometimes it is almost debillitating and I feel scared of esophagus issues. Sometimes the pain goes up to my neck and down my back. I am currently taking mastic gum between meals, 75 mg ranitidine, chewing DGL licorice, taking digestive enzymes, and drinking aloe vera juice before meals. I am on a probiotic and drinking apple cider vinegar in water twice per day. I have tried dietary changes and have recently given up sugary sweets. I am drinking alkaline water.\n\nMy question is, should I be worried about the nearly constant dull ache between my shoulder blades or is this a normal part of acid rebound? If it’s normal, I can persevere through the pain and keep cutting down on that horrid PPI. Has anyone else dealt with this? I am considering making an appointment with my PCP, but they always say I should increase my PPI as high as possible. I am tired of drugs. I am only 37 years old. I have tried getting off PPIs once before in 2016 and it worked for awhile, but then I had shooting pain in my back and chest. I got scared at that point and started up again and increased from 20 mg to 40 mg per my PCP’s instructions. I have been on and off Nexium and Omeprazole off and on since 2015. I have had 2 endoscopies. The one in 2015 showed a small hiatal hernia and mild gastritis and the one in 2017 did not show a hernia and looked pretty good.

Can't drink, eat, or walk without pain. Please help me","post_content":"Age: 22 Sex F Height: 5'2 Weight: 110lbs Race: White/ Native American Duration of complaint: Since August 2016 Current medications: Linessa, Paxil\n\nI'm really desperate for help. I am unable to work and I'm in pain 24/7 but nobody will take me seriously and I need to know what I should be asking for at this point. So sorry for how long this is.\n\nExtreme abdominal pain. The pain feels like I'm a pumpkin and somebody is scraping out my intestines. When I'm very bloated it's difficult to get urine out. I spent a week in the ER with severe dehydration to the point where I couldn't breathe. It hurts to touch my stomach. I've also been getting...rashes? on my hands and arms. If I get a cut or anything nothing will heal, it takes weeks/ months. A significant amount of hair has fallen out. I'm tired all the time and sleep for 12 hours a day. Can't eat or drink without pain. Can't walk without pain and haven't left my apartment for a month. Sometimes gas continues for hours upon hours. Pain worsens around 4:30 and continues until around 1pm the next day. My bags under my eyes are very dark, my skin has become very pale (and I'm not a pale person). I can't eat many foods.\n\nIn April 2016 I began to lose weight, and lost 100 pounds by the next year through walking/ calorie restriction. I had binge eating disorder before this. In July 2016 I had my first attack, for a week straight I had severe intestinal pain that left me unable to walk. I'm not sure if it's relevant but at the same time I was living in a really bad apartment, everything was breaking and I had toilet water leaking into my bathroom from the upstairs neighbours 24/7. The pain eventually subsided on it's own but it kept coming back for 4-5 days at a time and then a period of being pain free. I tried gluten free, dairy free, FODMAPS etc etc with no changes. I was diagnosed with ibs at this point by a walk in clinic, the doctor wouldn't let me say anything other than \"stomach pain\" then shoved me out, I wasn't given anything. Another doctor diagnosed me as bulimic.....lol...not puking.....\n\nThroughout the rest of the year the pain continued to get worse, it was mostly hitting me after 4pm and I would have nonstop gas for HOURS at a time. By Summer 2017 I was at my first job and it would leave me unable to work most days.\n\nIt got intensely worse in October and has completely spiralled from there. I've eaten the same thing every single day for over 6 months because although I'm in pain every single day of my life other things tend to make it worse. Basically some carbs are safe, no vegetables, no protein, no fats. I eat oatmeal all day if it gets really bad, but I will still be in pain if I do so. Drinking water makes the pain worse. I haven't left my apartment in over a month because I have stabbing pain from walking. My BMs are very very dark and I usually go 2-3 days with nothing and then have diarrhea. Two days ago I had to go to the ER because of the pain...but was told I should take a walk and have tylenol lol?\n\nHere's my pain diary: https://i.imgur.com/9TSsusz.jpg\n\nRash: https://i.imgur.com/OjzQJr1.jpg (they come and go, the itchy part is just where my IV was, the other bumps aren't itchy)\n\nMy doctors say my blood/ urine tests are normal, but my white blood cell count is 7.40 and my leucocyte esterase is 250 (I can post my full blood/urine tests if needed- I had two done). They also said my ultrasound is normal with a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis and mild postvoid residual volume. I'm having a HIDA scan on Monday. I was meant to have a colonoscopy and the doctor who was going to do it said the pain is \"normal for women\" so I walked out. My Xray said I have scoliosis. No blood in stool. Those are all the tests I've had. I take digestive enzymes and probiotics. I'm currently waiting to see a GI and am first in line if someone cancels an appointment.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/39846/mysterious-illness-can-t-drink-eat-or-walk-without-pain-please-help-me"},{"post":{"author":"crankthedialtotheright","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Hiatal hernia, GERD or both?","post_content":"I’m a 22 year old female who is overweight in the 190’s but have currently lost a good amount of weight over the past year and am continuously exercising and losing weight. I was born early in the 90’s at 31 weeks and diagnosed with acid reflux a few months after I was born due to failure to gain weight from being unable to keep milk down. I was on zantac as a young child for it as well but it never controlled it very well and often got sick. Stomach pain, heart burn, vomiting and dizziness. I don’t remember the exact age or why I went off of the medication as a kid but somewhere in there I did. I had a few years were it seemed as if I was better but around my early teens I suffered from severe vomiting, acid regurgitation, stomach pains, heartburn and dizziness. I was put back on zantac after they checked my gallbladder out and two-three months later was immediately removed from it as it made my symptoms almost worse. Clearly H2 blockers aren’t for me. I was put on Omeprazole 20mg once a day and bam! Good as new. But as the years went on, I found the food I could tolerate becoming less and less full of variety and in 2014, due to symptoms coming back. Mainly acid constantly in the back of my throat. I compared it to downing a shot of whiskey and lightning it on fire. Not that much fun to be honest. I was upped to 20mg twice a day and that almost immediately fixed me. But again, the foods I could tolerate became less and less till I hit a point I was only eating cheese, bread, graham crackers, skinless chicken breast, low fat turkey and potatoes. I am not kidding. I drank a plain soda from time to time but nothing else too risky or fun. Then this entire year it seemed as if the meds stopped controlling my gerd as well as they did in the beginning. I finally got so dizzy and nauseous I was barely able to function. I was switching off Omeprazole and to Nexium 40mg once a day. Again. Over a month passed but unlike before when my meds were upped, it didn’t fix me. It made them more tolerable but I still felt and feel horrible. Currently on 40mg twice a day. The acid regurgitation is pretty well controlled but I’ve been having stomach pain. My actual stomach. Severe chest pain at times. Sometimes it feels as if food is getting stuck on the way down. Not in my throat but about halfway down my chest, where the front of my bra is. Sometimes it feels as if my stomach is being stabbed or if I haven’t ate in days, even if I ate twenty minutes ago. I get nauseous and dizzy from time to time. Sometimes I swear I’m even having heart palpitations but I have anxiety so it’s hard to say if it’s from that or just nerves from feeling so ill. I get full quite quickly and no matter how little or how slow I eat, I often find my stomach feeling extremely full and like its half in my chest, almost. I get severe stomach pain throughout the day at random times that ranges from uncomfortable to me in the fetal position crying. I’ve had two doctors, my regular doctor and my GI (which I’ve been referred to last month. Saw her. An endoscopy was ordered but cannot get in until late December.) I adore my doctors and trust them immensely but a possible hiatal hernia has been mentioned before and at this stage, I am quote curious. I truly believe with my symptoms I have Gerd and a hiatal hernia or possibly just a hiatal hernia that is causing the gerd. I was premed in College before I took another route in life but I am rather curious. Does it seem like a hiatal hernia, gerd or both? I’ve had surgery mentioned due to H2 blockers not something I’m able to tolerate and I’ve tried five different PPI’s at this point and nothing is controlling it to a point that I am able to work. Employers tend to not look too happy at the prospect of hiring an ill employee who multiple times a day has to lie down due to stomach nausea and pain. Any and all thoughts welcome!\n\nCurrently I am taking Nexium 40mg twice a day. Avoiding all trigger foods and beverages and have been for years. Only water is drank. Current diet is plain oatmeal with a banana in the morning. A plain turket sandwich at lunch and a baked potato with salt and another sandwich for dinner. I sleep sitting up or on my left side. I am exercising to lose weight almost every single day. I do not smoke nor drink alcohol and never have. My symptoms are chest pain, severe at times. Stomach pain. Feeling as if food is getting caught in my chest at times. Early satiety, postprandal fullness, feeling as if my stomach is in my chest at times. Sometimes I feel short of breathe after I eat, as if my lungs don’t have enough room to expand properly. Sometimes I get heart flutters/palpitations but again, that might just be anxiety related possibly. Burping for no reason, even after just taking a sip of water. Sometimes my breath smells bad and I have a bad taste in my back of my throat. An ulcer hasn’t been completely ruled out but due to my history with gerd the GI doctor seems to think an ulcer is not the main cause and gerd or a hiatal hernia could be. I cannot get in to get scoped till late December and just wished to get some input till then.","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn"]},"responses":[{"author":"cocobrla","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Hiatal hernia, GERD or both?","resp_content":"I certainly understand the limited food that you can tolerate.

I’m a 40 year old women, my stomach was becoming severely bloated, I looked fat even though I am 5 foot 8, weighed around 125, the big stomach was not at all flattering on me. I would not go to the bathroom for almost 3 to 4 days and even when I did it was a struggle to try and get something out. I was having breakouts on my face, felt very sluggish, weird discharge from my vaginal area, it all was embarrassing and caused me a lot of stress...UNTIL I was reading about how people would use vinegar or apple cider vinegar for a detox for their bodies but I’ve never really thought of drinking it. I’m a cook though, love to concoct foods, so I thought about putting a mixture together that I could drink and wouldn’t be bad tasting and in one night, literally within an hour my stomach went down, I had a BM and within two days I went to the bathroom a few times, mind you I was backed up almost a week. No diarrhea or anything like that just a nice natural urge to go to the bathroom and cleaned out my system! I could not and still can not believe it!! My tummy is as flat as it has always been except for these months of horrid bloating!! I don’t have measurements of what I did yet exactly , I just make it the same twice a day everyday... but eyeing it out...about 1/4 cup to 2/3 of apple cider vinegar, about 1/4 to 2/3 water, I used the lemon juice that is in the plastic fake lemon that you get by the produce dept, I squeeze about 2 long squeezes of lemon juice into your vinegar/water mixture, then about 2 to 3 tablespoons of honey (depending how sweet you like it) then stir it up till the honey dissolves and all is mixed then add ice and drink up. I drink a small glass in the morning either before or after breakfast and then a small glass before or after dinner whichever would work for you. I’m telling you I SWEAR by this! My breakouts on my face went away, I have cleaned my digestive tract out, however you want to call that, it is absolutely amazing! I’m not a doctor or nurse so I cannot say this would work for everyone but at least give it a try! I was in tears the first night because I was very down on myself with my abdomen looking how it was and the sluggish physical and mental feeling I had. I am so happy I just want to see if I can help anyone else!

Based on my symptoms he suspected Crohn's and wanted to check for colitis. I had a colonoscopy that looked great and he suggested repeat colonoscopy every 2 years.\nMy anus area became very irritated, itchy, skin tags, hemorrhoids. I was able to get in with another (closer) colorectal surgeon in early January and she diagnosed me with Pruritis Ani and prescribed me a topical ointment and diet to follow to assist with healing; however she did not want to rule out Crohn's yet based on family history, what she had noticed, etc. She stated sometimes it can start in other areas before it makes an appearance in the rectum, colon, etc (Metastatic Crohn's?)\nAfter about 2 weeks there was great improvement and I was almost back to 100%. I reintroduced a few of my normal foods.\nFor the rest of the story, all cramps include entire abdomen in pain, chills only during cramping, having me doubled over, and make me dizzy/lightheaded:\nSaturday, 1/27/18 I began having cramps and diarrhea. That evening I was very cold and could not seem to get warm and had the chills. I assumed a stomach bug.\nMonday, 1/29/18 I missed work due to being up most of the night Sunday with cramps and going to the bathroom. I was in pain, tired, weak. Walking from one room to another would make me light headed. I tried to rest as much as possible.\nTuesday, 1/30/18 evening noticed that when I wipe after each time I had diarrhea, there was a snot like/mucus texture and color was getting to kind of yellowy.\nWednesday, 1/31/18 diarrhea still has mucous texture and when I wipe it yellowish tint on toilet paper. Also observed the stool hanging from anus and slimily falling into the toilet.\nThis makes 5 days of cramping and gas and/or diarrhea. There is slight cramping constantly in my lower abdomen and I constantly feel like I have to have a bowel movement but can only have whatever will come out after the intense cramping.\nI am trying to stay as hydrated as possible, but not eating much as I'm not sure if it's more that I have loss of appetite or I'm just scared to eat anything.\nAlso, I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I have been on my period now for about a week and a half which isn't typical; however my cycle is never regular due to Nexplanon - had it 2-1/2 years (Will be taken out by August). This makes it difficult to tell if any blood is from that or stool, so I cannot offer a confident answer on whether or not there is blood in the stool.","like_count":"0","tags":["IBD","Crohn's Disease","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Bloating"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/38800/what-is-wrong-with-me"},{"post":{"author":"baby_bump2018","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Poop floated than sank when peed.","post_content":"Not sure how much clearer that can be.

I have periodic episodes of chronic stomach pain that feel like the cramps you get in the early stages of the stomach flu (no throwing up though). These cramps are usually triggered by periods of eating spicy food and/or milk (I was lactose intolerant as a child). They can also be accompanied by some bleeding when eliminating. The blood appears on the surface of the stool and will sometimes drip afterwards.\n\nJust recently I had blood-work done as a part of a life insurance application. The results showed that I have lower than normal AST, GGT, Total Protein, Albumin, and Cholesteral. After reading a bit it appears that the only worrisome result is the low protein and albumin levels. My globulin level is normal, so I'm guessing that the abnormality in the total protein is all the fault of my albumin level which is 3.5 g/dL.\n\nAre these simply symptoms of under eating and high stress that can be remedied by just eating more and avoiding foods that I'm sensitive to, or would it appear that there are some more serious issues going on here.

For many, many years now I have had soft and occasionally loose stools. No big deal though, just part of life for me. Anyway, about a week or so ago I noticed after one of my poops that the water at the bottom of the bowl around the poop had turned an orange-ish red color after about 10 or 15 minutes. Kind of dark and hard to tell but it looked more orange than red. Also the water at the top of the bowl was more yellow (like what you would expect from urine) so the effect was more akin to a diffused orange that got lighter at the top into yellow. Since then, I have noticed this several more times, including today. The poop appears to be normal brown color from what I can tell from, you know, wiping. It doesn't appear tarry or darker than usual either. It is decidedly not the same color that I have experienced before when I eat beets, which does turn the water red! Anyway, obviously the coloration is seeping out of the poop itself, and I am just wondering if blood wrapped up in the stool would turn the water this color. If not blood, then what could it be?? Is this something I should see a doctor about or wait a while to see if it resolves on its own?

Need Help","post_content":"Hello!\n\nThis will be a long post so please bare with me.\n\nOver the past 3 years I have been experiencing strange symptoms/episodes infrequently that I believe are related to a combination of dehydration and low-blood sugar but because the incidents have varied so much in severity I have had trouble tracking what the actual issue is. I have not consulted a doctor because of how infrequent and varied the incidents are.\n\nI work in the woods for a living as a forester in Oregon. When these incidents started I was working for a timber company on the coast that had just acquired some work inland on the western slopes of the Cascades. While the ground itself wasn't as steep and rugged as I was used too in the coast range, it was higher elevation and the temperatures were quite a bit higher day to day (One week topped out at 108 deg. F consistently). The first day I experienced one of these incidents I was working in a higher elevation area and it was around 95 degrees. I had left at 5 in the morning from the coast to make it to the inland jobsite at 9 am and had drunken a fair amount of coffee and some water but not nearly enough. I had also only eaten a gas station breakfast sandwich with no plans to eat again until dinner that night. After hiking through some steeper ground, I began to have blurred vision in one eye. It felt like I had a \"floater\" that just wouldn't disappear so I sat down and sipped some water. This continued to a varied degree for about 15 minutes and then dissipated but it was followed with a pretty bad headache coming from the top of my head and my temple. I also felt pretty hungry oddly enough. I took it easy for a little while longer, ate a granola bar, and then continued working. About 10 minutes later I began to feel pretty nauseous and ultimately fell like I was either going to throw up or I needed to have a bowel movement. About an hour later I did the latter and felt better and finished out the day. This didn't happen again for another month or so but when it did, it was under the same conditions in the same area and I ultimately attributed it to not being hydrated enough and started to cut back on my coffee consumption quite a bit and focus on eating and drinking well and the incidents didn't really ever happen again.\n\nAfter about a year I accepted a job on the eastside of the Cascades where the ground was ultimately way flatter but I was in, again, higher elevations. This position had me in the Office a little more than I expected and definitely more than my previous position where I spent 50-60 hours in the woods a week. I began become more out of shape because I hadn't adjusted my eating habits or began exercising because I had always relied on the work I do to keep me in shape. Every time I would go into the woods in this new position I would over exert myself because I would try and work at the same rate I used too. I began to have the same episodes only I had one that was particularly bad where I had the same blurred vision, headache, and hunger only this time I tried to eat a large lunch after and ultimately ended vomiting. Because of the increased office stress of my new position, I was drinking quite a bit of coffee through out the day and then coping with the caffeine at night with beer (Not a lot of water was being consumed). I had a pretty unbalanced diet with eating next to nothing for breakfast, a medium sized lunch, and then a huge dinner. This has continued until now where I have recently tried to change my habits and get into better shape but the last couple times I have tried to exercise even with adequate water consumption (I have been using the half your weight in ounces rule of thumb) I have the same incident occur and feel like garbage until I sleep it off. It doesn't happen in the woods as much anymore because I don't drink any coffee on those days, drink water consistently throughout the day, and try eat small meals consistently throughout the day.\n\nAs I am writing this out, I feel like I am answering my own questions but this has really caused me a lot of depression because I am almost afraid to hike in the woods again because I might have one of these episodes and my job is my passion. I worked out for 30 minutes yesterday and felt great until about 15 minutes after I finished when my vision blurred and the whole process started again.\n\nDo any of you guys have suggestions? This happened maybe 10 times across the last 3 years. I am 6'1 and 250 lbs. When I worked on the coast I was around 215.\n\nThank you for your time and help.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/37294/is-this-dehydration-need-help"},{"post":{"author":"criten_avernath","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Stumped","post_content":"I've also posted this under skin conditions, as none of the categories appear to match my situation:\n\nI never do this, as the internet is the worst place to research health conditions, but my doctor, and every specialist I see is stumped. I'm hoping that someone here may have either experienced this, or has seen something similar. I'm a middle aged, fair complected man, but my problems are much more than skin deep. Please read my description, and let me know your thoughts.\n\nAbout March of 2017, I noticed that I was running a daily low grade fever (typically around 101.1). My wife was ill, and the only reason I noted the change was because I was being diligent in not wanting to bring an infection home. Around May of that same year, my children were asking me what the spots were on my head. At the time, I laughed it off as a joke, but eventually, my eldest took a picture of what he was talking about (it was on the back of my head). The images both shocked and scared me.\n\nI am balding, and have been since my 20's, so hair hasn't been a priority for years. I typically shave, or keep my hair extremely short. I'm also redheaded, so what I'm about to describe is bizarre. I was developing dark patches of hair (semi-circular) on my scalp. I immediately saw my GP, fearing the worst. He told me that the skin was normal, but the hair itself was turning dark brown or black (hyperpigmentation). He stated that he had never seen something present like this.\n\nWhile I was there, I discussed the fever, and some other symptoms I had been having. I've had various levels of pain in my abdomen, as well as pain in a spot in the right side of my throat (which I think may be deferred from the chest), as well as fatigue and a general sense of being unwell. He stated that it might be stress, but that whatever it was, appeared inflammatory. At that time, I was also having one of the worst acne flare ups I've had since I was in my teens - I'm in my 40's now.\n\nThe doctor indicated that it might be a form of lupus, and referred me to a rheumatologist. They were not in agreement, due to other symptoms not being present, but indicated that the darkening may relate to the acne. Well it's been several months now, the acne has cleared up, but the fever, pain, and darkening of my hair continue. I don't want to exaggerate, but I look like a dalmation, and I don't know the cause. Additionally, I'm tired of feeling like hell.\n\nI've had numerous tests, and quite frankly, I'm not made of money. That said, I'm worried that if I back off, I may be ignoring something serious. I've searched the web tirelessly over the past several months, and nothing matches what I'm seeing. Additionally, new symptoms seem to develop regularly. I don't use recreational drugs, but I do vape and drink on occasion. Until last year, I was in fairly decent health. Does anyone have any idea what would cause this?\n\nThanks in advance...","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"olga111","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Stumped","resp_content":"Did you try a dermatologist\n"},{"author":"criten_avernath","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Yes.

It doesn’t hurt to touch, and It gradually got worse. I didn’t eat yet so at first I thought I was hungry. But I ate and it still continued and gradually became worse as time went on. It’s kind of difficult to explain the pain, it’s almost like a hollow feeling. It’s not throbbing or sharp it’s just there. It peaked around 3:30pm and was so painful I was about to go to the hospital it hurt so bad. As I was debating going to sit in a hospital for hours, it subsided. This is the third time this happened this year.\n\nThe first was a year ago, when I was alone with my son he was an infant. I thought it was my period coming at first (not sure why because the pain was high up) and I tried Aleve and ibuprofen and it made it worse. I called my husband to come home and then called him back to cancel because it started to ease up.\n\nThen the second was waitressing at my old job and it was the same way started a little bit and got worse through the day. It got to the point I couldnt really walk and I started crying. They sent me home. Then shortly after I left, it got better and I felt stupid for freaking out.\n\nSo the pain seems to contract like get worse and worse and then release a little bit when it peaks. The pain at its highest level is relatable to when I had a kidney stone. It is like an attack it happens then it’s over but it last hours. When the pain is at its worst it only last like an hour or less.\n\nI’m Afraid it’s something stupid like really severe gas, but it’s rare enough I don’t think that’s it.

Did stool WBC calprotectin tests in 2014 that were normal (no ova, parasites, cysts, inflammation). 2017 stomach pain back strong...abdomen/pelvic ultrasounds clean, breath test results showed SIBO (predominantly hydrogen, but I think also methane). Did Xifaxin (Rifaximin) 550mg 3x/day 14 days (failed), linzess, ibgard, peppermint oil, dicyclomine, ibuprofen, probiotics (heard may be bad for SIBO?) + Siebecker's SIBO diet (not strictly).

About 8 months ago, I began experiencing really random bouts of nausea. Some episodes lasting hours, some not as long. This nausea was not triggered by anything in particular, with or without food on my stomach. Before this began, I was weighing a healthy 120-125 pounds. My nausea began happening often enough, that I understandably could not eat, and when I did, it was not much, or just potatoes and soups.\n\nWhen I first saw the doctor about this, they gave me Rx for Zofran for the nausea, fluids, and another Rx for omeprazole thinking that acid may be the culprit. They also tested me for h.pylori (negative). The nausea continued. After my doctors basically made me feel like this was all in my head, I gave up on them and got in with a gastroenterologist. He performed a biliary ultrasound (came back normal) and an upper endoscopy. He stated that he found mild gastritis in the duodenum that tested negative for infection and celiac disease. He said this mild gastritis was most likely not the cause of my symptoms.\n\nI was then referred to a psychiatrist due to the thought that these symptoms could be stress related, although I did not see how. They put me on a low dose of Trazadone every night.\n\nThe symptoms continued and to an extreme level. After being bedbound for a week, I became nauseated, dehydrated, and malnourished enough that I landed myself in the E.R. While in the E.R., they performed a chest x-ray and an abdominal CT with contrast, which came back normal. They sent me on my way with more nausea medication. At this point, I was now down to 100 pounds at 29 years old.\n\nThe following week, I began seeing a nutritionist and holistic practitioner. He ran tests on my blood, urine, saliva, and a mineral test as well. From these tests, he have me a supplement regimen based on all the areas I was deficient in. He said my digestive function was low (no shock there) and the lack of nutrition put my body in ketosis and it was eating itself. He put me on a Mitochondrial Restore, a powder probiotic, Skeletal Strength capsules, 1/2 TSP of flax seed oil per day, Repair-Vite intestinal repair, Master Gland capsules, and whey protein shakes to help with nutrition.\n\nIt has been 2 months and I feel worlds better than I did before. I am eating more. I have only put a couple pounds back on, but no further weight loss. I have had a couple bouts of nausea, but for the most part have been able to ward it off. I have been obsessively concerned about my weight, though. I want so desperately to get back to a healthy weight and I just do not understand why I am not able to put it back on since I am eating, getting nutrition, and taking needed supplements.

For treating constipation problem you can increase your fiber intake. Fibre adds bulk to you stool. Include high fiber foods like raw fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, grains and seeds in your daily diet.\n2.Green vegetables not only contain fiber, they are also a good source of magnesium that can help improve constipation.\n3.Prunes and figs are high in fiber and tend to have a laxative effect.\n4.Yogurt improves digestion and is soothing to the stomach.\n5.Bananas are another fruit that you can eat to treat mild dehydration and constipation.\n6.Increase your water intake as fiber needs water to pass through the digestive system and form stool.\n7.Exercise-Movement encourages muscle health and stimulates digestion, so going for a walk after eating may help get things moving.\nFor cases of occasional constipation, pelvic floor exercises have proven more effective than laxatives.\n8.Herbs like flaxseed, psyllium, senna, aloe helps to relieve constipation 9.Avoid oily, spicy, junk food.\n"},{"author":"healthegut","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Constipation","resp_content":"I can relate, it sounds like IBS.

It started around Nov/ Dec 2016. In the beginning I just wouldn't go for a few days, but then I'd go for a run and that would help. However by the end of January I couldn't go without laxatives. The stool softener ones (ex. miralax) didn't do anything at all, only the ones that cause bowel contractions (dulcolax ) actually work. On the rare occasion I would go a tiny bit without laxatives, the stool was never hard, it was just as if I didn't have the urge to go.\n\nAlong with this I've gained weight, and have had a ton of trouble trying to lose it. I always seem to be hungry, and never feel satisfied with meals.\n\nThese symptoms made me suspect hypothyroidism. As I've also had irregular periods, cold intolerance, fatigue, decreased sex drive.\n\nHowever I've been to four doctors, two ran blood tests, and my TSH and T4 levels were completely normal.\n\nAnother doctor determined it to be IBS-C, and prescribed Constella, which literally did nothing. One doctor insisted it was my diet. However I normally eat very healthy, especially during the summer. During the school years (especially during exams) my diet probably got a lot worse. However the fluctuations in my diet did nothing to change the constipation symptoms.\n\nIts at the point now where if I don't take laxatives, I literally just won't go.

after multiple tests and visits the hospital has still not been able to identify the issue.\n\nThe pain was accompanied by three vomits over the first two days, one occurring directly after being given Tramadol IV.\nThe pain is a constant cramp-like feeling, similar to labour pain, occuring in the mid-to-lower section of my belly.\nTummy exams over the last few days have shown varying degrees of tenderness, sometimes barely any, sometimes tenderness towards the lower right side and sometimes to the middle left side.\nNausea and loss of appetite are almost constant, though i suspect it has been somewhat a side effect of the strong painkillers.\nA list of tests that have returned normal include; Multiple bloods, urine tests (including multiple standard pregnancy tests), abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan.\nA list of issues that have been ruled out as highly unlikely at this stage are; Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Ovarian cysts, Urinary Tract Infection.\nI have an Implanon contraceptive in my left arm and as a side effect hadn't experienced a period for over a year.\n\nI have been to hospital now three times.\n\n-The first time I was admitted.\nThey ran a series of small tests (bloods, urine, stomach exams) as they suspected possible appendicitis.\nTo manage my pain, which was about LVL 7/10, they gave me IV Tramadol, which increased my nausea (I vomited immediately after) but covered the pain successfully.\nAll test results came back normal, so they suspected it was simply due to some gastrointestinal upset.\nThey gave me a script for Paracetamol/Codeine and Ibuprofen for pain management and sent me home aprox 3am from the Emergency Dep.\n\n-At home.\nStill under the effects of Tramadol, I was able to sleep for a few hours.\nThe pain began to gradually return once I woke.\nI went to the chemist with my script as soon as they opened, then began taking the Paracetamol/Codeine (still very nauseous, I couldn't stomach any food so I was unable to take the Ibuprofen at the time).\nPassed a normal stool.\n\n-My second time to emergency.\nIt became clear that the Paracetamol/Codeine was not effective and pain level slowly returned in full so I returned to the Emergency Dep around midday.\nI experienced mild cold sweats and I vomited a large amount of yellowish-slightly green bile while waiting to be attended.\nI was given oral Tramadol and an anti nausea tablet.\nAfter a tummy exam resulted in tenderness in the lower right region I was put on IV fluids and was fasted in case of appendicitis.\nThey then followed up with the Abdominal ultrasound and Transvaginal ultrasound which came back normal.\nI was then moved to a ward for overnight observation.\n\nDuring my time in the Observation Ward I continued being given a dose of Tramadol, paracetamol and an anti nausea tablet six hourly or so, when the pain began to return.\n\nI was assessed by the Ward's surgeons and they agreed that based on the normal results gained from all my tests that they didn't believe I required any kind of surgery and that I could come off of fasting and IV fluids.\n\nThey proposed that I stay the night under observation, try and eat and drink and see how I progressed.\nIf nothing else occurred overnight then I'd likely be able to go home in the morning.\nAfter speaking with me they sent me for a CT scan, which came back normal too, I then spent the night in the Obs Ward.\n\nReceived an anti clotting injection to my thigh, apparently standard precautionary protocol for Obs patients as they're at risk of developing DVT.\n\nAt the suggestion of the night shift Nurse I then started taking Oxycodone and paracetamol instead of Tramadol to see if it it made me less nauseous (which it did, worked wonders and helped me sleep).\n\nRe-assessed by doctors in the morning, they admitted that they didn't know what the issue was but suspected some kind of gastrointestinal issue that should pass.\nThey prescribed me ten Oxycodone to take home for pain management.\n\nBefore being discharged I noticed I had slight vaginal bleeding, which I notified the nurses of.\nOne nurse suggested that it could have been caused by repeated blood pressure bands being placed on top of the Implanon, interrupting it's normal function.\nThere is also the fairly reasonable possibility that the Transvaginal ultrasound may have caused mild bleeding.\n\nI was then discharged.\n\n-At home.\nI slept when I arrived home, but awoke with returned pain of around LVL 4/10.\nI had a lacy red rash over my chest and shoulders, I thought perhaps a heat rash as I woke fairly warm in my bed (it was the middle of the day).\nI then took my next dose of Oxycodone and paracetamol two and a half hours early.\nOver the next hour the pain rose slowly to a LVL 5/10 before the Oxycodone seemed to kick in but only took it back down to LVL 4/10.\nOver this time mild vaginal bleeding continued.\nI returned to the Emergency Dep because I was afraid the Oxycodone wasn't going to work and I didn't want to wait until it got bad again and spend several hours in agony waiting to be seen.\n\n-Third emergency dep. visit.\nThe triage nurse gave me two Ibuprofen/Codeine.\nI sat down to wait with a pain LVL 4/10.\nBy time I was taken into the Emergency ward the Ibuprofen had brought my pain down to a really good level, varying between non existent and LVL 3/10 depending on how much I was moving.\nI waited in the Emergency Ward for a few hours, it was very busy, and was briefly assessed by a nurse who suggested that the Ibuprofen/Codeine may have eased the pain because it was an anti-inflammatory drug rather than just a painkiller.\nI ended up leaving before being assessed by a doctor as my pain was under control and I didn't feel confident that I needed emergency treatment.\n\n-At Home.\nI returned home to continue treating myself for pain with the medication I had.\nI have continued taking Oxycodone every six hours, and taking the ED nurse's idea on board I've been taking one Ibuprofen 400g three hours after the Oxycodone to take the edge off.\nIt has worked quite well so far and I'm hoping this will help to keep the pain at bay.\nVaginal bleeding has increased slightly, though certainly not alarmingly.\n\nThis is pretty much where I stand with it all.\nI'm feeling ok, my pain is being successfully managed.\nI'm eating small amounts of plain foods when taking the Ibuprofen and drinking plenty of water.\n\nI'm just afraid of what will happen if the pain continues at the heights it has been at whilst continuing to go undiagnosed.\n\nI only have six Oxycodone tablets left, so ideally 36 hours of pain relief remaining unless the pain eases up on it's own (which I'll be super happy about haha)\n\nAll in all I'm very curious to know if anyone has any ideas of what else to do or has had any experience with a similar issue.\nI am really eager to get some kind of idea of what is going on.\nI can't live with the pain and nausea and I can't just keep going to the Emergency Dep every time the painkillers stop working, I really need a solution!

By the time I reached high school I experienced stomach discomfort on almost a daily basis with a few times it was so debilitating that I could barely walk. There were times when I would almost crap in my pants – I didn’t even know it was coming until the hershey squirt happened. When I look back at this time, I’m amazed I was able to play and excel at sports – I think it was the adrenaline that seemed to lessen the chronic pain and discomfort.\n\nMy parents had initially blamed this on me being susceptible to stomach viruses but it became such a regular issue that they brought me to the hospital for tests (blood tests, kidney tests – had to drink something that I forgot the name of, and an enema followed by a colonoscopy). But they never actually looked at my stomach. It ended up that I tested positive for “mono”. The doctors didn’t see anything else from the tests so they blamed it on “mono”. But I never knew why mono was an explanation for stomach pains.\n\nBut the problem never went away even after I recovered from mono. After that I just hid my symptoms from my family and friends (mostly because I was afraid that my parents wouldn’t let me compete in sports). I was experiencing some sort of stomach pain almost every day when I got to college. I was actually used to it and could function as a student but had to stop playing sports – I just wasn’t healthy enough to regularly compete at a high level. I also had a few really bad painful stomach experiences. On one occasion my dorm mates had to call an ambulance. But the university infirmary didn’t do much other then give me some pain killers and tagamet.\n\nTo make a long story much shorter, after I graduated college, the painful stomach episodes became more frequent. I had a reoccurring stabbing pain in my stomach that seemed to move into my bowels. Basically the doctors prescribed ulcer medication which didn't really work.\n\nThen one day I had the most excruciatingly painful bowel movement in my life. I felt like my anus was being ripped apart. What came out shocked me. It was a perfectly spherical ball – seemed about the size of a baseball. It was heavier than a normal poop - it made a weird splash and thud when it hit the bottom of the bowl. It also had a series of perfectly round extruding nodules that completely covered the ball in a symmetrical pattern. When I looked down at that thing and the blood - I was completely scarred and flushed it. If I didn’t know better, I would say it was man-made because of the perfect shape. I’ve always regretted not taking it out of the toilet for testing. But did I flush some sort of cancerous tumor down the toilet that was working its way slowly out of my body’s digestive system?

Underwent laparoscopic cruroraphy, fundoplication toupet (partial), abdominal cavity readjustment, after the surgery they found left sided pneumothorax, and it was liquidated with one puncture.\n\nThey gave me chicken broth soup the day after the operation and I got sick and felt like throwing up, they put a probe into my nose and pumped the soup out.\nWhen I got back home I had terrible chest pain and went back for x ray, they said that gullet was swollen and changed my medication, for the pain they gave me ketorolac and Toradol but it gave me an anxiety attack.\n\nThen I went to see a gastroenterologist and had Barium X ray on an empty stomach, Lungs and heart were consistent with the age and norm.\nGullet was passing barium meal well, walls were elastic, wrinkles were evident, right angled.\n\nStomach is in shape of a hook, is expanding normally, there is a lot of secretion in the cavity, is puffed up. Shape on large curvature is looking simpler, plain. Mucus shape is deformed, poor. Peristalsis is of average depth, equal. Evacuation of the contrast is timely. Duodenum bulb is deformed. Regurgitation is evident.\nIn horisontal state hiatal hernia relapse is not shown.\nConclusion was that I have acute gastritis, duodenal gastric reflux.\n\nThe surgeon said that it was an inborn hiatal hernia and it was huge, that was the reason why operation took three and a half hour.\n\nRight now I am on my fifth week, I am taking Nexium 40 two times a day, one pill in the morning on an empty stomach and second before going to bed, Tridat Forte (trimebutine maleate) three times a day before each meal ( I eat three times a day 250 grams of food after blending it in a food processor), Simalgel (Aluminum hydroxide & Magnesium hydroxide & Simethicon) before each meal.\n\nMy day starts with me waking up belching, then when I eat and I eat small amounts and food that does not cause gas, my belching worsens and I have more gas in my stomach, I walk for an hour or two belching trying to relieve the chest pain. I eat three times a day every four hours and when chest pain is bit lessened when I eat it worsens again. I feel pain in my breast bone and most of times it reaches my heart and the sensation is like I can’t breath and I am suffocating, when I belch it seems to relieve the pain for a second. I am afraid of taking opioids because it caused me anxiety attack but I am on my fifth week and the symptoms are not getting any better. I am very nervous and trying not to worry, I take half of 10 mg amitriptyline at night to help me sleep, but at around 6 am I wake up and fail to go back to deep sleep and I am tossing and turning before I wake up altogether.\n\nA week ago I had diarrhea and it cause me a lot of pain because spasms were even worse, but since I am careful with what I eat and I make sure that medications I take does not have diarrhea as their side effect my stomach is feeling better and it is functioning well.\n\nIf my stomach is functioning well, then why am I experiencing chest pain and uncontrollable belching and gases throughout the day?\nI am low on energy and since walking seems to help me with belching more I am losing energy even more.\nI read somewhere that 270 degree surgery leaves you with belching and in case of 360 degree people have trouble to burp.\nI wanted to ask is there any medication that can help me with chest pain and can you help me understand what situation I am in?

Suffice to say, drinking the right amount of water and adding more fiber/greens hasn't helped me out. I've even been taking a broad spectrum probiotic, as recommended by my dietitian, but, again, no change to my bowel habits (I think taking the probiotic twice a day for several days made me feel sick, so I'm back to taking it only once a day).\n\nWith all of this (which I've been working on for the greater half of this year), my dietitian decided I should try to cut out all dairy products for 3-4 weeks to see if I might have a dairy sensitivity (while intolerance causes diarrhea, she told me that a sensitivity can cause constipation). I started it yesterday after having tried out and chosen some dairy alternative products (her recommendation of pea-based Ripple Milk is great, as it has the same amount of protein as cow's milk, but isn't as sweet or watery as a lot of other alternative milk, and I found a dairy-free, plant-based \"butter\" that tastes just like butter...but I'll avoid any fake cheese like the plague, because what I tried tasted like sacrilege!).\n\nBUT...on the morning of Day 2 (the day I am writing this post), I'm already feeling withdrawals. I feel a bit weak, even though I had a protein-rich snack and lunch (used Ripple Milk in my cereal for breakfast, so I got the same protein I would have gotten if it was cow's milk), foggy-headed (almost like a headache, but not really), and I am CRAVING sweets like no tomorrow. It sucks! Not to mention the agonizing realization that, during this trial period, I will have to avoid a lot of pastries and chocolate that are brought into my office (unless if someone had the heart to bring in Mighty-O donuts instead of Top Pot), and avoid all pre-made breakfast sandwiches served in any cafe, since cheese comes on them by default (and they are usually frozen/refrigerated, so the cheese can't be taken off before heating up). I mean...at least restaurants where they make their plates from scratch can honor a customer's request to not even add dairy products. It's only Day 2 and it's maddening to think how much food I love has dairy in it, even food that I honestly would never imagine would have dairy at all (same with things that have wheat/gluten - why add something extra to foods/drinks that has nothing to do with it? Which is why hard cider being labeled as \"gluten free\" cracks me up. But, no, I am not cutting out gluten, just dairy). And almost anything I see in grocery stores that has dairy taken out is labeled as \"vegan\" - I am not going vegan! I have nothing against eating animal byproducts! I just can't have dairy until the trial is over and I see if it made any difference. Can't things be just \"dairy-free\" instead of lumped up under the \"vegan\" label??\n\nWell, anyway, that's my story, and I hope that perhaps people could give me some advice (besides what my dietitian already told me) on how to successfully get through the next 3-4 weeks...and how to treat the withdrawals I'm already experiencing. I should point out that I already take a Vitamin D supplement every day, since I get some seasonal blues with the lack of daylight.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/34685/going-on-a-dairy-free-trial-and-feeling-withdrawals"},{"post":{"author":"louabaker","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Husband's Issues","post_content":"Long story short, my husband was diagnosed with Gastric and Esophageal Cancer almost three years ago and had his Stomach and then his Esophagus removed one year a part (2015 and 2016).

I didn't go to a Chinese doctor. I actually went to a holistic doctor. Many Americans have too many toxins in their body and the holistic doctor tried helping get some of them out (foot baths). Wheat can also sometimes actually be detrimental to the stomach enzymes. She has to find what works for her. When I took out the majority of meat, dairy, and fast foods, I felt a lot better. I currently only eat fish as a meat. Meat and majority of the other things we eat are acidic. I still eat gluten. I did take it out of my diet for a while and I didn't find a huge relief. I do believe in moderation. I would go for the organic meats if she continues and really get smaller portions. I would google alkaline foods and just try it for a while. I laugh when I hear commercials about dog food not having corn, wheat, or soy. All of those can have issues with human guts too. However, that's the American diet. People treat animals better than humans. Sorry, just heard the commercial.

I have been to my primary care doctor multiple times and have been waiting on an appointment for GI and my appointment is scheduled for late January.

I'm 19 and I'm struggling with what I think might be IBS.. I want to go to a doctor to see if I can get help, but my dad, who's the only one with a job, doesn't \"believe in doctors\".. the rest of my family is dirt poor and jobless, so I'm out of options. The night after Thanksgiving I had friends over for a party-- I had just finished my menstrual cycle, so I was happy to be able to leave the room again and cook. Come around 2am or so, I suddenly got a terrible cramp in my stomach and had to run to the bathroom. I had pretty severe diarrhea for the next 2 days or so along with an upset stomach. Then, it was just non-stop pressure in my stomach. Nothing too bad, mostly felt like gas, and early yesterday morning, it finally went away. I was really happy, in a really good mood. I thought it may have just been something triggered by my end of my menstrual cycle, as something similar happened last month as well. Though, come about 7pm yesterday, I felt that awful feeling in my stomach again and had to excuse myself to the bathroom again. It was still diarrhea, which wasn't surprising, but this but time there was a rather large (maybe the size of a quarter) blotch of white.. slimy stuff on it ? Mucus, perhaps, just incredibly visibly white. Since then, I've felt so incredibly bloated, it feels like I'm going to explode.

I am a 24-year old male and about a week after Thanksgiving, I started to get this pain behind my left breast and in the rib cage area underneath the breast itself. Anyways, I really started to notice the pain especially when I breathed in or either put my arm up, raised it above my head, or put my arms in front of my body. The pain would really hurt around the left breast when I made those movements. In addition, I started to develop stomach symptoms such as burning in the stomach, cramping, diarrhea, and pain in the side of the abdomen as well as in the kidney area. After trying out a round of antibiotics, the pain was still there which caused my doctor to prescribe me with two new antibiotics (Ciproflaxcin and Flagyl) which helped to ease the stomach and chest pain for about 10 days.\n\nHowever, the stomach pain is still there sometimes when I eat certain foods and my doctor recently put me on Zantac and Omeprazole to see if those would work. Besides my Primary Care doctor, I also received a referral to a Gastro doctor who I visited yesterday. The Gastro doctor doesn't believe it is anything serious besides possibly GERD, but I have to stop taking the meds for two weeks in preperation for a H. pylori test. Besides that, the Gastro doctor also wants to conduct a Barium swallow test to ensure that it is nothing major.\n\nWhile we wait for that, I continue to deal with the chest and rib pain especially behind the left breast extending up into the collarbone and below both breasts in the rib area. Lately, I have noticed that the pain does come and go, but usually is pretty persistent in nature. Ibuprofen seems to help as does hot showers, but it eventually ends up coming back and hurts.\n\nI do have a Subaortic Stenosis heart murmur, which the cardiologist is not concerned about and said to just monitor, and had both an Echocardiogram and EKG done last month. Both of those tests came back normal as did the chest x-ray which came back with no evidence of COPD. I am hoping that this is something muscular related or even Costochondritis and not a major cardiovascular disease or an issue related to my heart murmur.

A few years ago I traced my issue down to intolerance to certain foods - especially nuts, chocolate, and berries. By eliminating these foods from my diet I achieved a significant level of relief. But lately the pain has returned and I haven't been able to determine what is causing it, nor to find any link between my food intolerances. I have spoken to my doctor and he doesn't have any theory or suggestions.\n\nIt began with sunflower seeds. The second food to manifest was spearmint leaves - spearmint was, by far, the worst, causing acute debilitating pain. Next was blackberries, then peanuts, chocolate, and strawberries. At this time, I could still eat tree nuts, cranberries, and blueberries, but I had to eventually mark each one off the list - the last two to go were cashews, brazil nuts, and cranberries.\n\nHaving eliminated all these from my diet, I experienced several years mostly pain free. However, last year I added cherries to the list, and earlier this year I noticed increased discomfort after eating bananas. Next was green cabbage.\n\nRelated foods that I can eat - lettuce, napa cabbage, apples, plums, grapes, bread and grains, melons, legumes, asparagus, avocado, tomato, root vegetables, pineapple, citrus.\n\nThis week the old pain level has returned. I have not changed my diet, so it is something I have always been able to eat, and just like with the other foods, the change is sudden. I have no other symptoms, such as diarrhea or gas. The pain itself is caused by swelling - I can see the difference in size of my stomach when the pain is on me, and when the pain passes, the swelling passes, too. I worry that I can't keep eliminating foods from my diet as I will eventually reach a point where I won't be able to eat a balanced diet. I would like to find a cause and treatment, but the whole thing seems so bizarre, I wonder if that's even possible.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/32910/expanding-food-intolerances"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"ongoing stomach issues","post_content":"Hey,\nI wanted to reply to Megan's post.

I've seen different doctors for the past couple of months and have yet to figure out what is wrong. I started crossfit in May and have lost twenty pounds until my doctor advised me to stop exercising completely in late October due to much fatigue I have been experiencing, and continue to experience today, until we find out what is going on. I am a 22 year old male, weighing approximately 158 and am 6 feet tall.\n\nIn mid-July I was started to feel a lot of discomfort in my stomach and abdominal area along with nausea, bloating, and constipation. It got worse after eating. All the symptoms left in early August but then came back in early September. So, I went to my family care doctor and he ex-rayed my stomach to show that there was air in my colon. He then referred me to a gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist checked for blood in my feces and there was none and he did a CBC and CMP blood test. The only thing that came back wrong was a low white blood cell count. So for the next month, my family care doctor ordered three more CBC tests, along with a SED Rate test, Peripheral Smear (immaturity not observed), CRP C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, Parvovirus, IRON AND TBC, HIV, HEPATITIS PANEL ACUTE, EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS, and COMP METABOLIC PANEL blood tests. Everything was normal and good except that my white blood cell count values were low from 2.8-3.8 during that time, a high monocyte percentage of 11.8, and it was noted I have bilirubinemia. Through much of October and early November my symptoms went away again except for the fatigue but now I am experiencing much of the same symptoms again.\n\nAs of last week I was referred to a hematologist and he took my blood in four or five tubes. I go back in mid-December to see what he says.\n\nThe hematologist also asked me to go to a gi doctor while I wait so I did today. My gastrointestinal doctor said it was mostly out of his hands because all my blood tests only show a low white blood cell count. So, he put me on two medicines to help me use the restroom (#2) more frequently.\n\nCould anyone lead me to possible causes of the low white blood cell count with the stomach/abdominal pain and the fatigue? I am quite nervous about what it could be because at this point I have no clue. Any help is appreciated.

I have been taking cold medicines but no significant effects.------------------------On 30th of September night I was soldering, I might have breathed in more fumes than I should, I forgot the vent fan. During midnight I heard myself wheezing and breathing heavily and could not \"naturally breathe\" and could not sleep. Every time I fall asleep I feel like passing out and wake. I went into the ER and the doctor told me I am having bronchitis. X-Ray of lungs came out clean. Ventolin was prescribed.--------------------------5 days later same happened. This time the doctor said I have asthma, another inhaler prescribed. I quitted smoking for 10 days. After that, I started smoking but the symptoms was not as bad as before. I only wheeze or having breathing issues as most as once a week. I know I should quit completely but nicotine withdrawal syndrome is killing me.---------------------Last week, 20th November, during midnight I feel like the area around my stomach was very, very heavy that I couldn't bear. I stood up, walked around and the heaviness was mitigated. I laid down, and the heaviness came back. I couldn't breath normally, my left hand went a bit numb and tingling. I went to the ER again and told the doctor I had a few bad stomachache recently and the doctor said I am having gastroenteritis. I was worried about my heart so I requested a cardiographs. Came out clean. Al/Mg OH and Simethicone Chew tabs was prescribed and taken regularly. Smectite Powder and Hyoscine Butylbromine tabs were also prescribed but I did not take them as I do not have diarrhea.-----------------------After that, I started eating congees and macaroni, and very little \"unhealthy\" foods during the time.However, during the next few days I am very constipated and could not defecate. I burp a lot and loudly but very few farts. I feel like every time I eat the food the foods were stuck below throat. I never vomited except for the 2 times when it was really unbearable I had to induce vomit.--------------------------I bought a few yellow dragon fruit that is said to help with constipation and it did the job. I had some painless diarrheas and I felt much better and I returned to a more normal diet for 2 days and was admitted to the ER due to exactly the same symptoms, heaviness below the rib cage, breathing issues and tingling. I also feel a mild heartburn.This time the doctor did an X-ray of the stomach and prescribed me with Famotidine and Lactulose liquid.----------------------So does anyone thinks all these are related or is it just that I am having a bad time or bad lifestyle that brought so much issues?I am 23 years old, been smoking since 17. I am obese and my diet is not very controlled. I occasionally eat very unhealthy food but I do count on what food should I eat.Thanks everyone in advance.","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn","Ulcers","Bloating","Constipation"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/32749/sick-for-3-months-now-what-is-happening-after-all"},{"post":{"author":"bostonbound","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Blood on side of stool?

Some people get constipated from certain foods, like bananas, while others get loose from them, so something in your diet may be the culprit. Are you eating anything unusual lately?

This is achieved by eliminating refined sugar and carbohydrate intake and eating fiber rich food-veggies, beans, nuts, and dried fruits. When gut flora is in imbalance, your pathogenic bacteria proliferate, causing gas and bloating, to the extreme of pain-often intense. Use of probiotics, at least at the outset, promotes normal gut flora, and intake of above-mentioned fibers ensures survival of those, as they constitute their nutrients.\nIf your dietary style suggests the above, it is even further helpful to take a local nonabsorbable antibiotic to eradicate them-ex rifaximin. Mind you, contrpuntally, systemic antibiotics cause immense harm on your gut flora, eradicating healthy microbes.\nSecond, assuming you have a healthy gut microbiota, we need to consider an acquired infection-though with healthy dietary habits this is v unlikely, a notorious example being Giardia Lamblia. If you have sulfurous burping, this turns highly probable! This is amenable to treatement.\nThird, more unlikely in western communities, you may have an acquired lactose intolerance; mind your intake of especially fresh milk-more likely a culprit than yoghurt or cheese. Symptoms start a few hours after ingestion, usually but not exclusively, with diarrhea.\nOther bowel -especially-parasitic infections are possible.\nThird, remember hormonal influence, mediated through serotonin, have a major role in intestinal peristaltic activity regulation-which if perturbed resuls in gas accumulation, and occasionally even excruciating pain. Typical frameworks for such a scenario, are anxiety and depression, and perimenopause( often missed). Notoriously, at perimenopause, bloating, flatulence, and belching are classical, and generally resistant to dietary modification. Often they are the hallmark of an approaching menopause, even much prior to menstrual changes, and they may be the only signal to it.\nThat is in brief; I know what you are going through is no petty trouble, it might constitute the whole trouble to you, and only one in your shoes would appreciate it.\nYou may keep me posted; take care.\nDr Hana Fayyad\nMaria Jasmine Freeman\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/31222/stomach-gas-in-the-morning"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Diagnose with H pylori","post_content":"I was recently diagnose with h pylori and started the triple therapy day 2 of 14.

Assuming a healthy digestive system and stronger immunity, helping us to fight against infections and protecting us when we take antibiotics are only a few benefits that these tiny little bacteria can give to us. The world health organization defined probiotics as: “Probiotics are microorganisms that give many benefits to our body when they are consumed in proper amounts.”\n\nThe digestive tube is the place where acts our intestinal flora, intestinal mucosa, and immune system. Inside our digestive system, it works 24 h from 24 h over 100.000 milliards bacteria. That`s why our body manages to digest what we eat, synthesizes the vitamins and other nutritive substance. Things like stress, unhealthy alimentation, antibiotics treatment can cause an imbalance to our intestinal flora, and this thing has a serious impact on our health leading to repeated infections, acne, mycosis, digestive disorders (diarrhea, constipation), fatigue and depression. And what`s the solution to all these? Probiotics are the friendly bacteria that rebalance our intestinal flora and bring the feeling of wellbeing.\n\nOur intestinal flora has many physiological functions, assuring a healthy life. Helps digesting the food helps to synthesize certain vitamins, feeds our intestinal mucosa and helps it, has an essential role in protecting our body because it acts like a protective wall which won`t let bad bacteria affect our body. When our intestinal flora is unbalanced, the good bacteria can`t work properly anymore. In this situation, to rebalance our intestinal flora is necessary a nutritive supplement based on probiotics. Probiotics help the wall to become stronger and to fight better against the bad bacteria. Probiotics also favor the multiplication of probiotics, and so no bad bacteria will have a place.\n\nSo here are the essential rules when you choose a probiotic:\n\nIt is recommended that probiotics should be taken in the form of supplements. To be sure that you have selected the most efficient probiotic make sure to follow those tips:\n\n1. Choose a product that contains a sufficient quantity of probiotics so that it has the effect you expected. More precisely, be aware of the number of CFUs used in the supplement you take.\n\n.2 Make sure that the bacteria are conserved in a safe method and that they remain alive. In this way, they will have better results in your body.\n\n3. void seasonal infections make sure you take a proper amount of probiotics daily.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038963/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27856521\nhttps://www.hlbenefits.com/bio-x4/\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-chen-md/probiotics-benefits_b_1934339.html","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/31775/learn-from-my-mistakes-and-only-choose-the-best-probiotics"},{"post":{"author":"hellored85","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Anxiety & Bloating?","post_content":"Hey! I'm trying to figure out the cause for my bloating. I'm a 32yo male, 67 kg in fairly decent health, I did smoke for 13 years and drank a fair amount when I went out 2 or 3 times a month. I'll try to give as much info as possible here below:\n\nDiet wise is good now. I've always been able to eat anything and have remained at 65-68kg regardless of what I ate.\n\nI was travelling in Asia for the past 14 months but have now been in Australia for the past 3. The past 6 months I have noticed bloating in my lower gut, front side all around where my belly button is. The first time I noticed it was in Asia and I put it down to drinking beer more regularly. The one and only time I had an actual reactive episode to food was around 5 months ago when I went to a good Italian restaurant and had pasta. Not a huge portion but within half an hour I thought I was going to explode. I have seemingly zero fat on me and my abdomen was bulging insanely. My gut area inflamed so much that I ended up being sick and having diarrhoea through the night. That led me to believe it was maybe a gluten intolerance so from then on I cut gluten out of my diet. But the bloating didn't really go away and I re-introduced gluten to my diet. That made zero difference to anything.\n\nIt generally gets worse at night but it is present in the morning still. I have no other physical symptoms present.\n\nThe only other thing I think it could be is due to stress and anxiety. On the face of it I feel happy, I'm always mentally aware of where I am in life and I'm good at making corrections in my thinking if need be. The first time an anxiety attack hit me properly was around 24 hours after finishing drinking during a hangover. It was a full on panic attack- tight chest the feeling of impending doom/ I was having a heart attack. I wasn't sure the cause at the time and then a similar thing happened a few months later and then became more frequent. It only happened on big nights of prolonged drinking. I'm a social drinker and the average week I drink nothing at all - a few units if anything. But when I go out for a big night, I drink a lot. 20-35 units in a single night. Although big drinking was rare, I've cut back further and only drank clean good alcohol.\n\nThe panic attacks/anxiety started to play a part in my everyday life. They were never full on attacks, more of a constant feeling and still always that tightness in the chest like my heart was failing. I read up heavily on the subject and started doing yoga and meditating daily. I also had a more fight than flight attitude mentally when confronting the anxiety which helped. So relaxing but also being firm in my thoughts definitely helps and the anxiety and tightness in the chest has largely disappeared.\n\nBut the bloating is still there. I should add I had a similar thing a few years ago. Never a panic attack but I was convinced there was a small hard lump in the centre left of my chest. Doctors then put it down to stress as I was cleared of anything else. They didn't give any explanation to how stress can manifest itself into seemingly real physical symptoms and really didn't take anything seriously at all. I'm by no means a hypochondriac but I'm fully aware how powerful the mind - conscious and subconscious can be. That's why I've taken the approach to my anxiety now. I eliminated certain foods to reduce the bloating but to no result - maybe I need to do it for longer and try different diets?\n\nI'm thinking it might still be a stress thing. I'm a self employed travel photographer - I'm quite hard on myself as the market is a tough one. I love working and do so all the time without sacrificing my own happiness.

Your gall bladder holds the digestive fluids (“gall” or bile) that help you digest fats and other foods. It is meant to release these fluids when you eat, and it causes the gut to begin the digestion processes. These fluids are very irritating to the gut and cause it to begin moving the food along. Without a gall bladder, the flow of bile from the liver, which makes it, is uncontrolled and causes irritation and very rapid transit of the gut contents, resulting in diarrhea. There’s no way to restore your gall bladder’s function and the bile now flows directly into the gut where it immediately begins gut movement. However, you can slow down your gut with loperamide (available over the counter) and also with cholestyramine (by prescription). The loperamide can be used to prevent (if you’re going out to eat) or treat diarrhea (when you already have symptoms) and can help you avoid embarrassment and pain and unfortunate accidents. The cholestyramine is usually taken daily and helps slow the transit time of the gut by providing fiber. These two medications have helped me tremendously. I also suggest that you keep an emergency kit available when you’re away from home, with baby wipes, hand sanitizer, underwear liners, a plastic sack for soiled clothes, and a change of clothes (worst case!). See your doctor for further help.

Terrible Pain.","post_content":"Please help me. Whoever is out there that can answer my questions. I am posting this on multiple websites.\nIt all started on Sept 30th, 2017. I went out with my family for a birthday dinner. My life was completely turned upside down that night. I was eating like normal and I accidentally took a whole shrimp into my mouth. I chewed it twice and swallowed it way too fast. There was no shell on it and it wasn’t a mini shrimp. I swallowed it whole because I was eating too fast. All of the sudden, I felt weird. The shrimp was traveling down my throat very uncomfortably and I thought it went down my air pipe. I thought I was choking and I started sweating like crazy. I started hyperventilating and had the worst chest pressure that made me feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die, I thought I could be having a heart attack. My family thought I had a panic attack. After I calmed down, I realized I could breathe but I couldn’t take deep breaths or yawn normally. I tried eating again but I started to get panicky sweats again and got very scared. I had the feeling there was food stuck in my throat and chest. (I’ve never had panic attacks before in my life).\nThat night, I have never been the same. It is now Nov. 9th, 2017. The week after my panic attack, my throat felt smaller and I had troubling swallowing food or drinks. Every time I ate food, it felt like it got stuck in my chest, no matter what I ate. I starting eating a lot less, like 2500 calories a day to less than 1000. The night I had a panic attack, I slept like I usually did but I had a hard time breathing normally. I didn’t get much sleep. Every other night after, I had terrible pain in my upper rib cages right below both breasts. I couldn’t breathe still. I went to patient first and told them everything. I got an EKG, blood tests, Chest and throat X rays, everything was normal. Nothing got stuck in my throat. Nothing was wrong. They thought I might of have acid reflux or GERD. They told me to take a drug store antacid like Mylanta. I took it a couple of times. I was having so much pain that week after the incident that I went to the ER as well. They did all the same tests and didn’t find anything wrong. I told them everything and they said it was probably GERD or acid reflux. They gave me a GI cocktail to help relieve some pain. It didn’t do much for me and my breathing was still not normal. I went to an ENT and he stuck a camera down my throat and said nothing was there. I went to a GI specialist after and got an endoscopy. The endoscopy was normal. The doctor said I couldn’t rule out acid reflux though, even though there was no sign of damage to my esophagus. He prescribed me some antacid medicine. I never took it. I went to another GI specialist for a second opinion, she told me all the tests they could do and I did a barium swallow. That test turned out completely normal too. They did an ultrasound of everything with my digestive system and didn’t find a single problem. I started to feel better after that awful week and tried eating more and more solid foods. The week after the panic attack I drank a lot of ensure. I slept that whole week propped up too. The week after the ribcage pain went away. I think it was because I wasn’t eating a lot. When I started eating almost normally again, I felt way better but I couldn’t breathe still and I still had trouble swallowing. It doesn’t really matter what food I eat, when I eat or drink anything, it feels like it puts pressure on my lungs or something. The chest pressure and breathing have gotten way worst in some moments. After a day of eating receses candy and ham and veggies, I got this burning sensation near my left breast in between my chest. After that day, I got a sore throat. Eventually I had a fever that lasted two days and turned into a cold. I think it might of started a week or two ago but now I have no appetite at all. I kinda always feel full and I have a cough leftover from the cold. I hear squeaking noises when I breathe inward. The left side of my stomach makes a weird short fart noise occasionally. I have gargling noises that come from a different part of my stomach too. I started taking a medicine the second GI doctor prescribed, pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day. I’ve been taking it for two weeks now. Sometimes when I eat food, I feel like I have to burp but I don’t and it feels like liquid comes up. I burp constantly whenever I eat anything or drink. I’VE ONLY HAVE BURNING SENSATIONS THREE TIMES MAX. The liquid feeling coming up never burns, it just worsens the breathing. I’ve woken up at night three different times feeling like I swallowed something and it got stuck in my throat. In my head I thought I was wearing a mask, and I swallowed it (I don’t even own any mask).How do I know this is acid reflux and why do I not feel hungry anymore? I never can eat much because I have trouble swallowing and it feels like my life is falling apart. Someone please help me. I’m losing hope. I need help. I can’t do anything normally anymore. I can’t tell If what im eating is hurting me, I cant breathe right, I cant exercise like I use too because I don’t eat enough. I am only 20 years old and 120 pounds. Life is awful. I’ve tried Xanax as well, it did not help with anything. I have to eat all food by grinding up almost to a liquid in my mouth. My chest pressure has never let up since that terrible day. What is happening to me?\nBtw when I take hard steps or jump off something, the front upper part of my teeth hurt really bad. I read that may be because they are connected to my sinuses or something? I am allergic to sulfur drugs and I have celiac disease. I’ve had it since I was 17. I do not eat gluten ever. I have never experienced any of this in my life.

All biopsies have been good, the lining of my stomach is normal, no signs of ulcers or inflammation. No h. pylori, and no detectable gallbladder issues, pancreas, stomach, intestine or liver issues.

I do not smoke, I do not eat red meat, consume alcohol, or any other drugs of any kind, legal or not.\n\nQUESTIONS\nIs there any other bacteria I should be tested for?\nWhat are other possible sources of this tenderness?\nAny tests that are not listed that I should try?","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/31442/stomach-tenderness-for-3-years-please-help"},{"post":{"author":"gagesaint","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Been Coughing/Is It Acid Reflux?","post_content":"I've been coughing after I eat for almost a year now, I went to the ENT Doctor a lot of times and he prescribed me with all kinds of allergie meds but they still wouldn't work.

I chalked it up to pressure on my cervix, and never being able to learn to properly apply the cup. So for pretty much this entire year I have been using tampons again.

I have not ever had an all inclusive std/i test done, but my paps smears onky ever turn up bacterial infections likely caused by ph imbalances. I drink kefir to help my probiotics.

They were simply emptying me, and sent me home. Years like this. They tried all the possible medication avenue on me, including Resotran ( prucalopride) and food combination. Still, the same. If i am not having an enema, i'm not going. 3 liters of water per day, exercice, healthy eating, and we've been into the no gluten, no lactose, no this and no that, and no changes.\n\nNow, for two months, i've stopped going to the emergency room cause i was about to loose my job because of it. They would even send me home very often with a 4 liters of Peglyte ( or Golitely). I was sick for days.\nI became anorexic because of this, for two years. I would feel like food was just poop that would be stuck, and that i was a *** barrel. Nothing else.\nMy life is all about this. That's a handicap, pure and simple.\nNOW, what's happening is that, i poop with a suppository. If i don't put it, nothing comes out. No matter how i force, the position, no matter nothing. I don't feel the need to defecate, i don't cramp, it doesn't push. I just know it's time because i get extremely cold, like it's winter inside my body, lightheaded, and passing so much gaz that it's another handicap.\n\nNow here is the interesting part. The suppository never even have the time to melt. I insert it and two minutes after, i hurt so bad , i have to go. No pushing. It comes all out, always the same: a veryyyyyyyyy long \"s \"shape smooth poop. So long, you wouldn't believe it was sitting there, right at the door...without knocking. But it is. I have no sensation in my anus when i push, as if it's dead. The suppository just induce the feeling for my anus to expulse because, the feces are right there.\nI have to do it like two times a day, to avoid inconfort.\nAfter i expulse, i feel terrible pain all over my body, i ache everywhere. It's like my skin becomes all thin, dry, my bones hurt, i feel soo soo cold....and i can feel the older poop sort of moving down, and that's why i have to insert another 4-5 hours later. Then the same amount of feces comes out.\n\nIn a way, i am and should be happy that suppositories replaced enemas. But....i don't feel better. I still feel ill and sick, every single day. I could not take the enemas anymore, it made me suicidal. Before, suppositories would not work. Now they do. The doctors were always impressed by my constipation, especially all located on the right side. And the amount of it. Several pounds. They never forget mentioning me. How a tiny person like me could have so much feces. They made me feel like an animal.\n\nSo this morning, i wake up and...im tired of the suppositories. Why is that nothing comes out, and that it's RIGHT THERE? Sitting there, that long thing. It hurts, im cold, tired, feeling weak, the pain in my body is just excruciating. I even have heart palpitations when the feces are moving inside of me, as if they touch my heart.\nSo..why is it that a suppository that doesn't have the time to melt, makes my feces comes out in one split second, to make me feel cold , in pain ( i even had to call off work often because i was too cold or lightheaded to get out) .\n\nMy whole life is about that. I'm unhappy, so unhappy.\nPlease someone say something.","like_count":"0","tags":["Constipation"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/29514/with-all-the-hopes-in-the-world"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Nervous IBS","post_content":"Now that I'm in my senior years I find that when I travel to distant places I get an irritable bowel within the first three days of travel that can cause very embarrassing moments.

It sounds like you are asking all the right questions to prepare yourself for life after major surgery. Here is some information that I hope will help as you work with your medical and surgical team to get ready.\n\nWe know that being prepared for recovery is one of the most important things you can do to reduce the number of days you spend in the hospital and to improve your quality of life. You may want to start by asking your surgery team if they have information about “enhanced recovery after surgery” (ERAS) protocols. This is where your team teaches you important information BEFORE surgery. Things like what to expect in the days before surgery, during surgery, and right after surgery. They will teach you about taking care of your surgical site to prevent complications, how to manage pain, and when to start eating after surgery.\n\nA lot will depend on why you need the surgery and what type of surgery you have. If you have a “J-pouch,” a technique where the surgeon takes the end of your small intestine and creates a small pouch that attaches to the anal opening, this will allow for bowel movements. Because the new pouch needs time to heal before it will work properly, usually a temporary ileostomy is also made, which allows your stool to leave the body through an opening in your abdomen.\n\nYou will usually need a second surgery to close the temporary ileostomy. The time between the first and second surgeries is usually about three months.\n\nAs your body begins to use the new J-pouch for bowel movements, you may find that you are pooping more frequently. Your bowel movements may be watery or soft because your body is absorbing less water. For most people, however, their overall quality of life is better.\n\nIt is really important to ask all of your questions and learn how to take care of your surgical sites BEFORE surgery. A lot of people are overwhelmed after surgery from the stress and pain. This may make it more difficult to learn and retain information about how to take care of yourself.\n\nI wish you all the best for your recovery and life after surgery!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/27417/colectomy"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Unusual bruising","post_content":"Bruising over night,I think it's my trazedone","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/27792/unusual-bruising"},{"post":{"author":"lilblueyez4u","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"bruising","post_content":"i am a bit afraid because i have severe bruising they show up over night,i have at least 50 small and med bruises just on my arms,and they are bad on my thighs.if i fall asleep with my hands between my knees or thighs i wake up with bruises you can see exactly where my hands were at. its bothering me cause i have never bruised this way","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: bruising","resp_content":"Me too every morning I wake up I have a new bruise,from trazedone\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/1738/bruising"},{"post":{"author":"mvk_1","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Gastritis And heartburn","post_content":"I have been diagnosed with gastritis yesterday and have been suffering from heartburn, bloating and fullness for 3 months now.\n\nWhat I don't understand is if gastritis is inflammation of stomach lining, why is my LES relaxing and causing heartburn to a point where my throat swells up everyday?

I spent 9 days in the hospital under the care of my pcp, with nausea, vomiting and dehydration.

Stomach filling and emptying tests, gallbladder, along with others. He decided to run the tests WITH me taking the antacids (which is not the norm). He wanted to see if the meds were doing their job. Sure enough, they were doing very little to help, since I have a severe case of acid reflux. I had no symptoms you would think of as reflux, except waking up during the night with bad taste in my mouth. It was all nausea. He put me on 60mg Dexilant twice daily, plus 40mg famotidine at bedtime. I started to get better immediately. I would strongly suggest seeing a gastroenterologist. He/she will get to the bottom of it. They will probably do an EGD to look inside your stomach. It's painless, but you do have to be put under for a short time. Good luck to you! (p.s.

Other things that increase the risk are poor hygiene and traveling or living in areas where these infections are much more common, like Latin America, China, or some parts of Africa.\n\nMost people infected with tapeworms don’t have symptoms. They may occasionally pass white or yellow pieces in their poop. Some people may have nausea, stomach pain, or lose their appetite. In some cases, people might have fevers, allergic reactions, or seizures, but that depends on how the tapeworm spreads in the body.\n\nThe best way to get back to regular pooping is to make sure you eat a healthy, balanced diet. Make sure you eat food with fiber, like vegetables and whole grains.

I have celiac disease and a history of anxiety.I take 10mg citalopram for anxiety. I recently traveled to Austria. I flew alone to Munich and the journey was extremely stressful, I had three panic attacks on the way. When I landed I missed my train and had to take a 400 dollar taxi to Innsbruck... basically, a very stressful journey. That night I felt fine but wasn't hungry really. The next morning after light exercise and being out in the sun I started feeling like I had a fever. Though I never took my temperature, I think I had a fever for a day or two. When I got back to the hotel room I felt extremely nauseous yet also starving (I ate nothing on the entire 24ish hour journey). I had panic attack which includes scratching myself, contemplating jumping out the hotel window, etc. Felt like I was about to throw up for hours and hours yet never did. Slept 12-14 hours for the next few nights. Was extremely hungry but whenever I saw food or smelled it I grew extremely nauseous. I expected to throw up many times but never did. Had diarrhea once, then no more bowel movements due to lack of eating. Took Zofran for the nausea twice, helped temporarily and then the nausea came back. I am definitely not pregnant. Took benadryl as well. I then took Valium. Went to a hospital, had an IV for fluids and also had Vomex in the IV bag. Took a flight back to the US (very traumatic, extremely nauseous the entire time, held a barf bag but never threw up) and went to a hospital in the US. Was given fluids. Then saw my therapist and psychiatrist. They told me that from not eating my body went into \"Starvation mode\" and stopped wanting to eat. They said my anxiety was causing the nausea. Forced me to eat, increased the dose of citalopram ( though it takes 3 weeks to kick in) and prescribed valium for panic attack/ extreme nausea, which I took twice but it made me really sleepy and extremely thirsty. Standard blood tests were done, and am going in for more specific blood tests soon (lyme disease, etc). I am extremely fatigued, unable to really eat, and constantly nauseous. Nothing seems to be helping, I have tried Sea-Bands, Zofran, sparkling water and more. I feel as though this is not anxiety because it began with a fever and hasn't happened in the past, and also because it is continuing for so long. I have been sleeping plenty, need to go to school because it's senior fall and important for college. Any guesses as to what I should try or what this could be (besides anxiety) would be extremely helpful.

Start with lifestyle changes, stress management, and addressing and removing certain problem-making foods from your diet.\n\nDid you know that stress reduces the normal healthy bacteria in your gut? Try practicing mindfulness mediation or other methods that create balance.\n\nTo calm an irritated gut, some experts recommend fermented and fiber-rich foods, as well as taking probiotics/prebiotics. But don’t throw the kitchen sink at it.\n\nThe most beneficial probiotics and yeast for gut health are lactobacillus, bifidobacillus and saccharomyces. These are found in everyday foods like yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods like pickles, sauerkraut, as well as kombucha tea [Full Disclosure, I’ve never tried this …].\n\nTo get the best benefit from probiotics it’s key to look at the best evidence for the condition you’re addressing. Meaning, using the right strain of bacteria based on the condition. Diarrhea from travel, antibiotic use, ulcerative colitis or IBS lead to changes in the diversity of your gut microbiome, and all are unique in their effect to the microbiome….just as eczema and general health maintenance shouldn’t be address the same neither should gut ailments. You have to look for probiotics that contain the right strain and dose.\n\nThe dose needed to help varies depending on the strain and product and the intended use.\n\nI would work with the recommendations of a gastroenterologist that also is knowledgeable on healing the gut with probiotics and not go it alone.\nBest, Dr Bruni\n"},{"author":"ginaaw","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Probiotic Nightmare","resp_content":"I'm going through the same thing.

I'm 18 years old male with a long-lasting problem that I'm very hopeful you can give me some advice on.\nHere's how it went.\nAbout 2 years ago I've noticed cracked skin on my hand. Since then it's always cracking more with the exception of when I apply an ointment to it, after which it heals the skin for a bit. If it matters, ointment that I use is a local one with galipot as it's core component.\n\nAbout half year ago I did some tests on the matter: complete blood count, biochemical blood analysis, syphilis blood test, several different urine tests.\nOnly values out of the norm on the result of these tests were AST and ALT activity level: 106 for AST, 196 for ALT.\nI then went for an ultrasound examination that have found me to have cholecystitis, with only other unusual notes being that bile echogenicity is slightly increased and there is a bend in the bottom part of the gallbladder, no stones or anything else unusual was detected.\nI also did test for HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C. All results were negative.\n\nAround 4 months ago, a noticable activity started taking place under my right part of the ribs: sometimes there's something moving or contracting, also a general feeling of tension around this area.\nThere were no acute pains for that whole period.\nSince then the state of the skin on my hand was only getting worse in proportion to discomfort under my rib.\n\nThen around 3 months ago I started the following course of treatment in hopes of curing cholecystitis assuming it's the only problem:\nAllochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day;\nSilymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule 3 times a day;\nDrotaverine - 200mg distributed for 3 times a day;\nPancreatin - 2 tablets with a meal 3 times a day;\n\nI did that for a week and it was the first time the skin on my hand was getting healed on its own without the use of ointment. The feeling under the rib also got better, tension was gone and there were little to no contractions or any signs of movement.\nI then took a break for about a week and the symptoms began to return. After I noticed that, I returned to the same treatment plan, but this time it didn't seem to help that much after a week, discomfort considering skin and the tension around liver was slowing down but wasn't completely reversed this time. But I was adviced that it requires couple of months of this kind of treatment to take effect, so after a similar break of about a week I started taking these medications again, only this time plan was a little different:\nAllochol - 1 tablet after a meal 3 times a day;\nSilymarin(Silybum Marianum) 140mg - 1 capsule in the morning;\nDrotaverine - 120-240mg only when there are noticeable contractions at gallbladder area;\nPancreatin - 1-2 tablets with tougher meals;\n\nAfter 1.5 weeks of this, the effect, again, was little and symptoms were only slowing down a bit.\nI did this for another 3 times, 1.5 weeks each, with around a week in between each.\nEach iteration it seemed like it was helping less and less, and definitely didn't seem like it was on the way of completely reversing the symptoms like it seemed initially.\nThe general pattern is that under no medications my hand skin and area under the rib are in a very tough state, and with these medications its only about half as bad.\n\nSymptoms at current point in time consist of: general constant feel of tension, contractions or movement, sometimes burning - all that regarding area under my right part of the ribs, also rarely all of these symptoms can be felt in my chest for a small amount of time after which they return under the rib. I only had one noticeable bit of acute pain at gallbladder area in this whole period of time 2 weeks ago.\nThe state of my hand skin correlates directly with discomfort under the rib. It cracks from time to time and when it does it also burns and itches.\nWhen I'm taking Drotaverine there are little contractions or any kind of movement, but it comes back if I don't take it. Other drugs on that list relieve general constant feel of tension and sometimes occuring burning under the rib. But they're still there, only little less while taking them.\n\nOverall, I don't seem to be heading on my way to recovery at all with current actions. So far it is only getting worse and I'm not even sure that cholecystitis is the only problem here.\nWhat would your professional advice be in this situation? Please help and I will be eternally grateful to you.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Discomfort under my rib and skin problem.","resp_content":"go see a doctor there r none here\n"},{"author":"brynerwayblessed","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"So, the 1st time I come to web md I see this for this kid's answer?","resp_content":""}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/8144/discomfort-under-my-rib-and-skin-problem"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Lower abdominal pain before BM + Bloody mucus","post_content":"Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask this. 27 year old female.\n\nI've been having a problem lately.

She ran my thyroid levels since I only have half my thyroid. They came back abnormal and I was put on thyroid medication. I never felt better in my life. Primary doctor kept me on it for a few months and then wanted me off of it. A few months after being off of it I was eating a box of macaroni and cheese. It would be nothing for me to eat a whole box and want more to eat. I was fine one bite and then the next bite I felt this really full feeling or pressure right above my belly button. This pressure can get really bad with me eating one more bite, taking a sip of a drink, or doing nothing. It can be tolerable one second and then the next second I am miserable. I went to primary doctor who ran my thyroid levels again which came back normal. I was eventually referred to a gastroenterologist who has done two upper endoscopys, colonoscopy, gastric emptying study, SIBO breath test, Hida scan, and a manometry study(haven't gotten results of this). All have come back normal besides the SIBO test. I was put on an antibiotic for that which did not cure my symptoms. A year ago I was having severe stomach pains right where the pressure above belly button is and would move across abdomen. I went to the ER. They did a CT scan without the dye because I'm allergic to it. They were mainly looking at my appendix but I was told the scan was normal. My periods have also been very irregular. I went to my gyno about that. They did an ultrasound to look at my reproductive organs. They found a very small cyst on right ovary which should have dissolved on it's on. Funny because the tech told me she couldn't see my right ovary because a lot of gas and feces was blocking it. I belch a lot more. I get quick, sharp, stabbing pains in my abdomen where the pressure is and on the sides of my abdomen in that area, on my lower back (by kidneys), shoulder blades, and chest right below throat. I have a pressure on my chest just below my throat. I feel and look bloated sometimes. It feels like there is a balloon inflated inside right by my belly button that is pushing that area of abdomen out. I also have more frequent bowel movements. Can anyone help me get answers.

Polyps near the end of my large intestine have also led to bleeding from my rear end, which is always fun...\n\nSo I recently incurred an ingrown toenail on my left big toe which became infected shortly after. As a result of the infection, I went to my local doctor and was given a prescription of Erythromycin antibiotics, which lasted a week and ended on Saturday just gone. The toenail seemed fine after the course, not paining me, so I thought it would be ok to walk around on it as normal.\n\nThe following Tuesday, pain had returned. a quick examination of the toe led me to believe that it had again become infected, as there was a yellowing of the skin in behind the nail. I again returned to my doctor who this time prescribed a stronger dose of antibiotics called flucloxacillin. I began taking them without thinking there'd be any side effect.\n\nThe flucloxacillin began to throw my stomach for 6 - I was fine for the first day, but thereafter was experiencing diarrhea 3/4 times a day. I thought this a normal symptom, but it ended up getting so bad that halfway through the course I found myself with a pot of blood underneath me after a trip to the bathroom. I decided that taking the antibiotics were doing more damage to me than they were worth, so I stopped taking them at the halfway point and saw a podiatrist about my toe instead.\n\nThe podiatrist did the trick, but unfortunately the antibiotic has left my stomach in disorder. I stopped on Saturday and it is now Thursday and I've had persisting diarrhea (through not as frequent, maybe 2 times a day) and bloating/sensitive stomach since.

A day later, I had noticed that there was also black in the stool and was accompanied by what appeared to be white corn, white seeds and few that looked like a noodle ? I had also noticed that I had been feeling sickly in general. I was experiencing a low grade fever, bad headache, bloated / distended belly , nauseated , feeling weak and tired. I was also having stomach cramps, lower abdominal cramping and some mild / moderate pain on the right hand side - a little lower than the rib cage. Occasionally I would notice that I was also having pain near the lower back area. The pain on the right was similar to strong but piercing gas pains. A couple of days later -I became concerned and contacted my doctor's office - I was unable to get an appointment because she is out of the office and everyone else was booked. I did speak to a nurse and - She pointed out the that the items in the stool should be a concern since it sounded parasitic. (And considering I was recently on vacation in Florida - that wouldn't be unheard of). The nurse suggested that I visit an urgent care facility. On 07/31 -Once I was in Urgent Care I was sent to the ER because they don't deal with any abdominal pain issues. In the ER they drew blood and sent me for a CAT scan. I was advised that I would also be getting a rectal swab / exam. A few hours passed and a Nurse Practitioner advised that I had a burst cyst on my ovary.

They focus too much on whether something works or not but less on potency or just how effective it is or things like consistency and if the supplement is reliable or not. Yes, CLA works if that is what you are asking.\n\nThere are surely several studies which can be used to clinically/scientifically prove it. Furthermore, there is a meta-analysis in humans, from 2007, which identified 18 eligible studies and compared them and the conclusion was that conjugated linoleic acid taken at a dose of 3.2, which is a pretty small dose when it comes to CLA because it is of a weak potency, can be able to promote a modest body fat loss in humans. Modest is the key word here, however.\n\nAnother thing people mistake is when they presume that their results will be the same as the results seen in a certain study or trial. No, CLA may not even work for you. In fact, it is clear if you go and look at the studies and trials, that conjugated linoleic acid has had to contradict and mixed results.\nIt is perhaps the most inconsistent and unreliable weight loss supplement.\n\nThe claims that are made online about CLA, some are just to overhype it and to sell products, meaning they are not true. Conjugated linoleic acid at a 3 grams per day dosage can work depending on the person, you may need more, up to 6 grams per day if you want better results. Your results will also depend on how active you are regularly and of course on what you choose to eat and what caloric intake you have.\n\nFor those that are interested. CLA works through PPARs which are nuclear receptors in your body, essential for energy metabolism. It's just not that effective, CLA that is, and may work differently for each person.\n\nAlthough it's found naturally in cattle beef or yogurt or milk and other products from ruminants, grass-fed cattle, the quantities in foods are not enough. You'll need to invest in a supplement and it just might not prove to be the best investment. I would advise you to consult a medic as well since CLA supplementation can come with side-effects.\n\nTo those that are new to weight loss, it may sound confusing. What I mean is, there is really no supplement out there which can burn your fat away without you making a change first. Let me explain because it is very simple.\n\nThe reason why you are overweight is a combination of two main factors, unhealthy eating habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. No matter who you are, unless you have a health problem that is causing you to be overweight/obese, you are either not eating right or you are very inactive.\n\nUsually, it's both, a combination of both. Some are kind of active, they go out to run once per week, which is not enough when you have bad eating habits because you are not burning enough calories. This can be resumed in two words, imbalanced lifestyle. People that are fit lead a balanced lifestyle. Yes, they eat healthily but don't think that they don't eat pizza or fast-food or enjoy a cold beer, eat cake and sweets, etc. They do, but they don't do it regularly or abuse it.\n\nSo you may wonder, of what use is a supplement if I still have to exercise and diet? Well, if I am to be perfectly honest, you don't need a supplement to lose fat, it's that simple. They can help but you just don't need them to do it.\n\nThere is no such thing as not being able to lose fat without using a supplement. Diet, exercise, and fat will go away, no doubt about it.\nHowever, supplements can help, even though the benefits are quite small.\n\nWhat's more, sometimes it's difficult to tell if the supplement is working since you are dieting and exercising and that boosts your metabolism and lowers your caloric intake creating a deficit and thus helping you to lose excess fat.\n\nThere are hundreds, thousands of people that have lost fat without using a supplement, we know it's possible, it's a fact. It's common sense actually.\nBut let's go back to benefits of a supplement. Think of CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). It is quite popular, although there are misconceptions about it.\n\nCould it help you? Yes, I mean it has clinical evidence. We know that it has influence over PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). In turn, the PPARs have influence over your metabolism and its regulation as well as other things in your body.\n\nUnfortunately it is one of the weaker weight loss supplements and it has mixed and even contradicting results in studies and trials but nonetheless, it can work. Some of you may use it, though, and not notice that it is working. It doesn't work for everyone and there are different isomers of CLA.\n\nEspecially if you are dieting and exercising, which you should be, you may just not be able to tell if it's helping. Using supplements like CLA Safflower Oil might improve your condition.\n\nSome helpful sources:\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20040520/cla-weight-loss\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugated_linoleic_acid\nhttps://diets-usa.com/cla-safflower-oil-reviews","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/12101/cla-works"},{"post":{"author":"as15cjbrock","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Need help making sense of ultrasound report","post_content":"Hello all. I am a 19 year old male who was relatively healthy until a few months ago. I had impacted wisdom teeth for about 3 months, and was taking NSAIDs pretty much every day for 2 of them.\n\nAt the time I was also smoking a lot, and developed a problem with mucous in my sinuses and throat. I was given 3 rounds of antibiotics which did not fix it, and then figured out that it was actually LPR, a type of acid reflux. I was also taking antacids pretty constantly for about 2 months before I was given a pantoprazole for 2 weeks followed by xantac. During this time I was often constipated, but nothing too major. Should also mention I quit smoking, was working out and eating healthy, and was all around relatively healthy\n\nShortly after taking the ppi, my symptoms took a turn for the worse. I started to develop gas and bloating after eating, and shortly after experienced abdominal pain ranging from mild to severe for about 2 months. My stool was also very oily and filled with undigested food. Sometimes, I would also wake up and be extremely pale, weak and lightheaded for a few days, then return to the normal problem listed above.\n\nI stopped taking any anti-reflux medication about 3 weeks ago, and although it has been a better, and the bloating, gas and pain is gone, there has been a huge swing in symptoms. For instance, I would get sweet smelling urine and be exhausted after eating carbs, but tested negative for diabetes twice, as this has gone away twice. I also experienced bodywide itching lasting for about 10 minutes, followed by brain fogginess and fatigue, which heavily worsed my ADHD, twice in two weeks. The first time eating whole wheat toast and eggs, and the second time being vector cereal. This hasn't happened while eating white bread. The last time that I was having the sweet smelling urine problems, I did a nocarb diet for a single day, before waking up the next day with such low blood sugar I couldnt stay awake, so I ate a bagel and since then have had no problems with sweet smelling urine or fatigue after carbs, besides when eating the vector cereal this morning. I also get lightheaded when standing up after laying down or sitting.\n\nI have just recieved my ultrasound result, and they have found fluid interposed between diaphragm and dome of liver, along with in bare area of the liver. All organs including the liver show no signs of damage, and no ascites were found. The report says possible subcapsular fluid or perihepatitis followed by \"This is opposed to a right pleural effusion\". I have no idea what any of this means, so if anyone could help me out, or make suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I should also mention that bloodwork was mostly all fine, with slightly high ferritin and haemoglobin, and moderately high WBC leukocytes. I also take Dexedrine to treat ADHD, and tolerance has increased very rapidly, as I did not use it properly during the time of my severe problems, taking much more than prescribed just to function. I take anywhere from 60-100mg a day, and gives me no drug high effects at all.

I have had trouble with reflux for a long time as it seems to happen too easily for me. I cannot handle a great volume of liquid or solid in my stomach for long periods or I will end up refluxing a lot of it up my esophagus. The manometry showed for me that my lower esophageal sphincter, the one between the stomach and the esophagus, was relaxing too often and thus allowing the food to come back up. Because of a 24 hour pH monitoring test I had at the same time, I found out that my reflux medicine was keeping the acid under control. The treatment of non-acid reflux is often with Baclofen which works to reduce transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations. I have been taking this medicine for awhile, and it has been helping have less episodes of reflux. I cannot say if this would help you, but it might be something you could ask your doctor about.

For over 2 years I've been suffering from stomach pain and nausea (and occasional diarrhea/gut issues); seen 5 doctors, taken almost every test possible, tried various natural and western med routes. The pain is not constant, it occurs randomly every 2-4 days, with mild stomach aches almost daily. It can last a few hours to a few days. I cannot find a link between food, amount of food, times I eat, etc. and the pain. I've been tested for SIBO twice and though it was negative went through two natural treatments that didn't help. I've had an endoscopy that only showed some minor inflammation of my stomach wall. Blood tests are all normal, breath tests normal, CT scan normal, Small bowel follow-through normal, ultrasounds normal, stool samples normal. The ONLY test (comprehensive stool analysis done by my Naturopath) that showed any actual results, showed a very high triglyceride count, high Fecal Secretory IgA, and a possible Candida Albicans overgrowth. I treated the Candida with Fluconazole for 4 weeks; it's been 6 and a half weeks since I started that and I've seen no change (except diarrhea from the med) - and yes I'm following a strict candida-diet.

My upper GI barium test was 'normal' so I was prescribed Carafate, it's helped the most but just dilutes the discomfort.

Rarely, it may last for years.\n\nThe cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal isn't clear. Some experts believe that it results from an increase in bile, especially bile acids, entering the large intestine — which may act as a laxative.\nGenerally, mild diarrhea after cholecystectomy is not cause for concern, but tell your surgeon or doctor if you are losing weight; have bloody diarrhea, fever or significant abdominal pain; or have diarrhea lasting more than a few weeks. You may also consider limiting foods that can make diarrhea worse, including:\nCaffeine\nDairy products\nGreasy foods\nVery sweet foods\n\nI suggest eating the BRAT diet: bananas, rice (white), applesauce and toast.\n\nWhen your health is good, physicians usually recommend whole-grain, high-fiber foods. But high-fiber foods could spell trouble when you have diarrhea. The BRAT foods are low-fiber and can help to make your stools firmer. Bananas also are high in potassium and help to replace nutrients your body has lost because of diarrhea.\n\nYou also can add oatmeal, boiled or baked potatoes (peeled), or baked chicken with the skin removed.\n\nAnother way to help your gut recover from a diarrheal infection is to consume probiotics — a food or dietary supplement that contains live bacteria, which replaces or adds to the beneficial bacteria usually found in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nWhile it’s wise to avoid dairy products when you have diarrhea, there’s one notable exception – yogurt or kefir, a fermented milk drink, that contain probiotics. These can restore the beneficial bacteria that you body flushes out with diarrhea. Just make sure the yogurt or kefir are low in sugar, as sugar can worsen symptoms.\nBest of luck\n"},{"author":"wareaglefan2","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thanks for the information.

I can say that the surgery did help with the acid reflux, but it led me to burp/hiccup (it sometimes did sound like a combination) a lot more for some reason. I did fairly well with it until around about 2000 when I started having increasing trouble with swallowing. Since it continued to get worse, my doctor (a new one by this time) decided to have it investigated. In an open procedure, it was found that a build of scar tissue from the previous surgery was what was making it harder to swallow. After it came down, I could swallow better, but the acid reflux came back, and I became diagnosed with gastroparesis. I am not sure if that is related to the surgery or if I had it before hand. I also had both surgeries done in an open fashion, and this can possibly result in more complications than the minimally invasive. Plus this is a long time ago, and doctors have probably learned more by now. I hope though that this can be helpful to you in some way. I hope that if you undergo this procedure, it will be a success and you will be able to bounce back swiftly. Many hugs are being sent your way on the wings of hope.\n\nWarm regards,\nBobbiejo\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/9963/hiatal-hernia"},{"post":{"author":"peggysue1978","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Hubby's hersgbrungs disease!","post_content":"My husband has Hersgbrungs disease.

I hope this may be helpful to you as you work with your doctor to find the diet that works best for you.\n\nIncreasing dietary fiber can definitely lead to more gas, which can make you feel bloated. Also, if you increase your fiber intake without also increasing your water intake, you won’t have enough liquid to push the fiber through your system. Both of these things can cause cramping and stomach pains.\nWhen you are changing your diet, try not to add too much fiber all at once and slowly increase your fiber intake over the course of a few weeks. Also, make sure you drink plenty of water.\n\nMost importantly, take it slowly as you experiment with what foods work (and don’t work) for your body and be proud of yourself for trying to make a healthy change.\n"},{"author":"figling","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"I did not mean to report this as abusive.

Turned out it was my my IBS, and it wasn't the fiber in a vegan diet that was the problem, it was the fodmaps, which are carbs and sugars that are difficult for people with IBS and other gastro conditions to digest and which trigger constipation and/or diarrhea, and bloating/gas. Many beans and grains that vegans depend on are full of them, but there are beans and grains that are ok.\n\nGoogle the Low Fodmap diet out of Monash University, in Australia. It's made a world of difference for me. You could continue to be a vegan, if you know what your triggers are and eliminate them. For example, edamame and firm tofu are low fodmap whereas veggie burgers and silken tofu are not. Small amounts of lentils and chick peas are allowed, as long as you don't get more than 1/2 cup a day.

I am 27 years old and have been suffering with GERD symptoms for a long time. I started out when I was near my 20's and I was nauseous all the time. My doctor then told me to take Tums. I hadn't experienced heartburn yet. Years down the road I noticed i'd have heartburn after eating certain meals like Mexican food and certain alcoholic beverages.\n\nFast forward to the past couple of years where it has gotten super bad. I remember waking up out of a dead sleep super nauseous and I had to call out of work as I had gotten no sleep and wanted to vomit everywhere.\n\nI never took PPI's until a couple of years ago. I didn't know you had to take them for a 2 week period for them to work. I tweaked my diet and eliminated my trigger foods. I'll admit I have some chocolate here and there but all other triggers are gone. I've changed my lifestyle as well by eating lots of snacks throughout the day instead of big meals. I find if I drink a glass of water and eat soup or a decent meal I will end up regurgitating it when I go to \"burp\".\n\nI have grown sick of it as I feel like a fire breathing dragon the majority of the time. This affects me to not want to do anything including working out as I can't cope with the pain. It makes it so hard to function in dance rehearsal sometimes. I am getting an endoscopy on Friday and hoping it provides me with answers. I am getting used to avoiding my trigger foods but it seems like there are tiny micro triggers that make all the difference still unknowingly in my diet. I know everyone has different triggers and safe foods. I just want to avoid being on long-term medication if it has negative effects. I can only picture myself snapping my ankle in dance class while landing a leap in the long-run which would be catastrophic to me.\n\nIt sucks because I can't go to certain restaurants with friends due to my predicament. I always feel like a bother when I have get togethers because I can't eat much of anything they want to eat. This is especially true of get togethers where the easiest food option is pizza. That's a total no-go for me. I told my boyfriend and best friend that I would cook something with my triggers in it for them and modify a version for myself so I wouldn't have to burden them. I feel so annoying always talking about my reflux but I really just want to beat it and be happy.\n\nI was hoping they would find H. Pylori when they tested so I could be treated and go back to normal life. That was a negative. I am being realistic when it comes to my endoscopy. They are probably going to diagnose me with GERD and I am hoping any biopsies they take give good insight and not any bad news. I will do anything to make this condition better. I am hoping for a strict diet to be given to me to see if I can negate the micro trigger foods I seem to be missing. I am not the classic person who takes medicine so I can eat those triggers. Occasionally I would love to have some chips and salsa or a slice of pizza, but if I can't then I am okay with that.\n\nCurrently I take 20 mg of Omeprazole before breakfast and before dinner.

They start with a build up of pressure in my chest so I know a minute or two before it starts that its on its way. My arms get very heavy and then I sweat profusely, so much that my clothes are drenched from head to foot including outer layers. The pain in my chest is like a burning sensation that gets worse and worse and feels very tight too. Once the attacks are happening I tend to get very agitated and quite anxious, though I'm not at all anxious before they begin and so I'm quite certain they are not Anxiety attacks. I feel slightly dizzy, a little confused and extremely uncomfortable within myself. I often, but not always start to hyperventilate, but other times I lie there hardly able to move and breathing very shallowly. A lot of the attacks have started after strenuous manual work but plenty of others have been first thing on a morning when I have only been out of bed for half an hour, I even had one just after getting out of the bath! After the attacks have calmed down I tend to feel extremely cold, very weak, quite emotional, and often I have tingling in my arms, hands and face. The attacks can occur quite randomly, once a week, once a fortnight or twice in a week. So far I've had roughly 18 or 19 of them.\n\nI was admitted to hospital after the first attack and initially they said it was a heart attack but after plenty of tests including an MRI and an Angioplasty they decided it was a \"false positive\" and my heart is ok.

I first found out I had hemorrhoids over 30 years ago when I went in to the hospital to have our daughter. They never really caused me trouble until about 10 years ago and grew more troublesome after I went through menopause. I saw a surgeon who told me that I had a really serious case of them and needed surgery, but I kept putting it off, for the same reason that you have...I was afraid of the procedure and the pain involved.\n\nI had both internal and external as well, and the biggest problem that I had was that they would bleed from time to time, and would thrombose every now and then which was extremely painful. Finally in the last year before I had surgery, the bleeding became a real problem. It would start suddenly and sometimes would be heavy and I often had trouble getting it to stop. Leaving the house to go anywhere was often problematic since I never knew when or where they would start bleeding, so I stayed close to home, or just in the house, a lot. So, after getting to the point to where my family and I had to postpone a vacation because they were causing me so much trouble, I'd finally had enough, and had the surgery. For the internal hemorrhoids, I had transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization, and then the more traditional procedure for the external ones. Fortunately, the surgery itself was uneventful and went well. I won't lie to you...There is a great deal of pain involved following the surgery and in the next couple of weeks after, but it does gradually get a little better every day. I've always had a high pain threshold and thought I could handle the post operative pain without having to use the pain med that I was prescribed, but it became clear to me the day after the surgery that I needed it. A narcotic pain med is usually what is prescribed following this surgery, and they can be constipating which you absolutely want to avoid after hemorrhoid surgery, so I limited how often and how long I took it. I only used it for a week, and then I toughed it out after that with Tylenol and when necessary, Advil. I managed okay with those.\n\nThe first couple of weeks after the surgery are the most difficult. The one thing that I can really recommend and strongly urge you to do is to use a sitz bath after the surgery, and/or to take a warm bath as often as possible. I recommend using the sitz bath after you have a bm, and periodically through the day. The warm water of the sitz bath was extremely helpful for me with the pain, especially after bm's, and also when I was just having discomfort. The warm water helps to keep you clean there as well and is very soothing. Your doctor will likely recommend that you use a sitz bath as well. I used mine religiously and it made a big difference for me.\n\nI have had a lifelong problem with chronic constipation which contributed to my having hemorrhoids, so I drink a lot of water, make an extra effort to exercise, and because I have IBS and have trouble eating bran, and raw fruits and vegetables to help with the constipation, I also use Miralax to help keep my bm's softer and regular. This works very well for me. As for whether you can have the colonoscopy and the hemorrhoid surgery on the same visit, I'm guessing the answer is no because of the prep involved for both, but I could be wrong and your doctor will have to answer that question.\n\nAs for whether having the surgery will give you a fresh start, in my experience, so far as of now, almost a year after my surgery, I can say that the answer is a cautious \"yes.\" I can leave the house, and travel now without having to constantly worry about whether they will begin to act up or will start to bleed suddenly and heavily. I put off having the surgery for so long, and now, despite the pain and recovery, I am so very glad that I finally did it. I hope all goes well for you-Best wishes!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/8095/hemorrhoids-and-colonoscopy"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Bright red blood on stool","post_content":"I have been experiencing bright red blood leaking when I pass stool.

I should add that I was born in Indonesia but left the country for the US when I was 3 years old and I have came back to visit on 3 other separate occasions - when I was 5 years old for 3 weeks, 9 years old for 3 weeks (this was shortly after I moved to Canada), 17 years old for 7 weeks. I am now 26 years old.\n\nFor the first three days my bowel movement seemed normal but then after eating some salad with lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, red peppers and some broccoli - more than just an amount for a side on the second and third day (since I would eat this from time to time in Canada) I started to feel stomach pain and suddenly I had uncontrollable, sudden urge nasty diarrhea the on the fourth day and have been getting milder diarrhea since then including the time of this writing. I've never experienced diarrhea or any bowel disorder during my previous visits and I believe it has to do with the vegetables I have eaten, as I have never had a salad in Indonesia (in the past I've only eaten cooked vegetables if any at all here). I did wash them intensively before slicing them up but I have read that I should've stayed away from uncooked vegetables altogether due to poor sanitation and whatnot here. For the past four days I have stayed away from spicy food, fried food, dairy products, fruits, and fruit juice.\n\nSince it seems likely I have traveller's diarrhea from some bacteria (ecoli?) I would like to know if there's something more serious going on like Crohn's disease. The only symptoms I have are on and off stomach pain and diarrhea that's not as bad as the first day and more controllable but still more liquid than it should (no fever, no vomiting, no loss of appetite, although not sure about weight loss). Also when I do take a dump it comes out smoothly with little forcd and my anus does not feel pain afterward.

No pains, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, etc. Tylenol makes it subside so I can sleep.\n\nOther symptoms I've noticed are increased burping (e.g. After having had dinner 7 hours earlier), an increased need to swallow (like the lump in your throats feel) and a possible sensitivity to some foods? (explained further below)\n\nI went to ER on 4/26 and all they could say at that point was that my lipase level was 68 and WBC was 13. My EKG was good and chest X-ray was clear. Negative for Lyme and bacteria cultures were clear.\n\nI have to note that, being stuck in the ER for 8 hours that day, I didn't get to eat anything all day and only had a non-fat yogurt, low-fat breakfast bar, carrots and water for dinner when I got home. I made it through the night with no issues.\n\n4/27 was mostly good as well - stuck to low-fat foods and was ok all day. For dinner we had homemade fajitas but I'm wondering if the spices or wrap triggered this again because I had the same issue.\n\n4/28 felt chilled when I woke up, lasted until around noon when it changed like a light switch and I became flushed; red and warm in the cheeks, neck and ears. That lasted for about two hours and then I was fine for the night. Again, food intake was light and on the low-to-no fat side.\n\nGot up this morning and stayed on that food path - cheerios, almond milk, banana and breakfast bar. Still feel fine right now. Just overall a little weak and/or sluggish, which is no shock since I'm not eating like normal.\n\nOverall, I get hunger sensations but have to almost convince myself to eat. My normal eating desire just doesn't seem to be there. I'll admit though that I'm also a little nervous as to what to eat, because I don't want to trigger the chills again (if food is even a trigger), but I'd say the lack of desire is a bigger reason as to why. Not surprisingly, I've lost a few pounds over this week because my caloric intake is definitely way down compared to normal.\n\nLast week, I had started adding at least 1 tsp cayenne pepper and ~.6 tsp turmeric to my daily smoothie to try and help with my BP. That's the only dietary change I can think of prior to this whole thing starting. I stopped adding these on 4/22 (date of the first night I started with this issue), mainly because it tasted horrible, so not sure if that's what started this. Possible inflammation of some part of the digestive system?? Or did it just bring some other buried issue to light now?\n\nShould they be sending me for a CT scan or something else?

It may or may not all be connected, but here it is:\n\nEver since my period started, it was unstable, so my mom thought I should try Chinese medicine. About a year after consuming it almost daily, I got what the doctors told me was just a stomach flu. But it didn't feel like all the other stomach flues I've had. After the first week, where I normally would I have been better, I still had no appetite. The doctors I've visited said I should try opening it up with something other than bread, noodles, and congee, so I tried some noodles with a bit of oil and broccoli. I ended up with wicked abdominal pain, and the \"no appetite\" sensation went on for about two months.\n\nIt's been a year since my initial \"stomach flu\" started, and so far, and I've gotten sick again every couple months. Although each time, the details varied, some of the symptoms would be the same (I had a coated/furry tongue one of the times): I would have abdominal pain that would be relieved after diarrhea (and unless I wanted to go through it again, I'd be limited to very simple foods), it would take more than a week (sometimes months) for me to get back to normal, gas/belching, bad taste in my mouth, and loss of appetite. I've done stool testing and blood testing, but everything came back normal. All the doctors I've visited don't think its anything more than a viral infection, and I've stopped going after the first 3 times.\n\nNow I've gotten sick again. This time, along with the gassy sensation, my stomach would \"burble,\" and occasionally, when I breathe in and out, the upper left side of my stomach would make gurgling noises, and I feel like it's sucking air in and out. As well, I had abdominal pains/discomfort after eating just plain white bread. I'm also currently on my period, which despite the Chinese medicine, did not make it entirely better. I'm not sure if one of the problems is affecting the other, but at the same time, my period has been just trickling for almost a week, and even for me, that's a bit strange.\n\nOn the few occasions where my period would come normally, it would last about a week or more, and the first few days are often painful in the vagina. (I also don't know if that is normal)\n\nYes, I realize IBS is a possibility, and so have the doctors I've visited, but it doesn't seem like there is anything in my life that would likely \"trigger\" it.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/6790/stomach-pains"},{"post":{"author":"mrschris2u","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Issues with burping.","post_content":"Here goes: I have several digestive issues going on including a colectomy, ileostomy, gerd, and a nasty bout of gastroperesis that put me in the hospital for almost a month.\n\nMy main issue now, however, is that I have \"gas\" but I can't burp.

Thank you so much!\n\nEvery year my family goes on vacation overseas and I have to take a plane. The problem is, I get extremely sick on the plane, NOT FROM MOTION SICKNESS. As I go deeper into the airport, I already feel uncomfortable. When going towards the plane on the aerobridge, I begin to feel much queasier from the \"airplane smell\" I start to feel very light-headed and nauseated as I approach the airplane. On bad years, I throw up even before stepping on the plane due to the smell. I try to breathe through my jacket to make the smell less intense. Once I am about to board the plane from the bridge extending from the airport, a wave of \"airplane smell\" hits me and I try to hold in my vomit. This is always futile, as I always throw up at least once before even taking off. This reaffirms the notion that it is not motion sickness. Throughout the flight, I experience flu-like symptoms: I vomit at least a dozen times, cannot get up from my seat, have a massive headache, and feel overall nauseated. Eating or drinking anything in the smallest quantities results in me throwing it up within seconds or minutes. I cannot eat or drink for a full 10 hours on my flight. When the meals are brought out, I feel even worse. Also, the smell of the blankets and the pillows provided makes me throw up as well. My theory on that is the compressed vacuum sealed air for both the food and the blankets.\n\nAs I do not have motion sickness, my best guess to me \"disease\" to the smell of the plane is the compressed air that is in the cabin as I would not be able to breathe otherwise.\n\nAll doctors I see locally have not seen a case remotely similar to mine and cannot think of anything to give to me to ease the pain, only generic Advil or something like that. We have tried all conventional methods used to ease sickness on the plane including every homeopathic medicine under the sun.

I don't want to give you bad news, however, welcome to your new normal. Don't get me wrong you definitely can improve with lifestyle changes. I have reflux, gastritis, and colitis. It has been 2 going on 3 years. It can be absolutely debilitating at times. It will get better over time when you learn to manage it. Definitely keep a journal of what you are eating. There may be certain foods that make your stomach/digestive issues flare. Try an elimination diet (look up online) take a food out for a week or 2 and then add back in and see if symptoms persist. I did this with dairy. Dairy is not good for me. If you are experiencing reflux often raise your bed 6 to 8 inches. If you have a hiatal hernia it can cause a lot of crazy symptoms. My sis in law has one. My chiropractor thinks I have a sliding hiatal hernia and those are hard to diagnose it could take a while crossing my fingers I do not have one. I also have the same stomach bloating its awful bloats so bad like you had a large meal. I know it sucks!!! It can be difficult to have a conversation. If you want relief fast you wont get it from doctors. They can only go so far. I am on PPI medication for reflux. A lot of this I have learned is what you eat and your diet.\nAlso ask your GI doctor about probiotics, please be careful about which ones you take there are a lot of bad products out there. I currently take VSL#3 medical food probiotic and it has helped me very much. Do not eat 3 hours before bed. Be thankful you have no diarrhea. Sorry to hear about this, you are not alone there are a ton of people with these issues. If you have a hiatal hernia you can get surgery to fix it.

Unfortunately it has severely upset my stomach (I have been taking two 500mg tablets a day as recommended on the pack, although I was silly to sometimes take it on an empty stomach or two tablets at night rather than divide them in 2 doses as advised) so I have obviously stopped taking it as soon as I noticed the problem.

I've tried taking probiotics I've been recommended in my local health store but they don't help. I did some Google search and found that what I'm experiencing (bloating, abdominal pain, stomach cramps, struggling to digest most foods) is called hypermagnesemia and calcium injections are one of the treatments as they help remove excess magnesium from the body because calcium is a natural antagonist of magnesium.

My question is, do you think that drinking calcium in an effervescent form would be a good idea as another way of increasing my calcium intake to balance that high magnesium level in my body?

Please let me know I'm not alone in this. I've been suffering with \"IBS-D\" since early 2006. My story begins as most do, Once Upon a Time, I was just fine. In 2006 I underwent surgery to remove my right Fallopian tube and ovary. During the procedure, the surgeon noticed that 6\" of my small intestine had collapsed. Concerned that severe complications would undoubtedly arise; the damaged intestine was removed and reattached. Recovery was unremarkable; outside of the NG Tube (which should be outlawed), and I went home a few days later. And so it begins, a few days after I began to experience intense spasms in my stomach; so much so that they come in waves so severe that I become nauseated and begin to vomit; cold sweats and to make it more complicated...severe diarrhea. I returned to the ER where I was admitted, given pain meds and Zofran, rehydrated, CT scan showed nothing. A few days later, discharged. Diarrhea has been my constant companion since. And to make it worse there is no holding it back. It has a mind of it's own and once started if I can't find a bathroom in 30 seconds or less; I'm a \"poopy-pants\"! Fast forward to January 2017, admitted to the hospital again for the same symptoms (this is the fifth time). I've been taking Lotronex for the past 2 years; which I must say has helped with the dreaded diarrhea but; not the spasms, vomiting, nausea. In researching the IBS-D pharmaceutical options; the side effects of the drugs is at best; frightening. I knew about what could happen with Lotronex; I signed a \"waiver\" to start the drug. At this time desperation made it impossible to see anything but no more \"poopy-pants\" at work, shopping, driving, etc. I'm desperate! I can't go through another \"bout\" like this last one and I want my life back. If there are one or two or 100 kind souls out there that can share anything with me that may help I'd be eternally grateful. Even if all you can do is tell me you empathize with me.

But my story starts a little different.\nI was a normal kid(no stomach problems) til i was about 10 years old, then i drank a pepsi and holy cow EVERYTHING started. Severe diarrhea, would last almost whole week, would just sneak up on me sometimes and i definately had my embarrassing 'poopy pants' moments. I hated it. My parents have always been \"oh, stitches arent for our family, super glue works best\" so i never have been to a dr for stomach problems. Its been 20 years and i now try to cope with it.

Usually if i stay out of any wind or a breeze, i can avoid it. But if i drink something and a light breeze blows across my body, it will make me get 'goosebumps' and thats when i know i gotta stop whatever im doing and get to bathroom asap. Its weird. And if i can get to bathroom fast enough, i wont have really too terrible of cramping. But if i have to 'hold it' then i will get cramps so bad it causes vomiting and about once a month i will find myself laying on bathroom floor with my pants around my ankles in a fainting spell. I usually have to strip almost naked to keep from overheating and getting dizzy. Then i have to curl up in a blanket to keep from getting chills. It sucks . I sometimes scream from the pain and my ears are ringing so i dont know that im being loud, and my husband has to come downstairs to let me know im waking my neighbors.

My doctors at the time were unable to ever find an answer as to what caused it and ultimately wrote it off as a freak occurrence that hopefully won't happen again. Then about a year ago, it was discovered that I was very anemic. My previous surgeon ordered an EGD, colonoscopy, small bowel follow through and around February, a capsule endoscopy, to no avail. He referred me to a hematologist, who started me on iron infusions. I received the infusions once a week for about 5 or 6 months. My iron did eventually climb to normal levels, but once the infusions were stopped, my numbers fell quickly. The doctor ordered yet another capsule endoscopy in August, but says it showed no results. Microscopic traces of blood were found in my occult stool sample, but my doctor kept telling me that we'll wait and see what happens.\n\nI finally scheduled myself an appointment with a gastroenterologIst in the fall and he conducted his own EGD and colonoscopy, which again showed nothing. He finally ordered a third capsule endoscopy, which I completed about 2 weeks ago.\n\nHis nurse practitioner called me today and said that there is an ulcer in my small intestine along with another stricture. She said that my capsule came to a stop in my small bowel and was worried that it might be stuck, so she ordered an x-ray for me to get quickly along with some additional blood work. After taking the x-rays, the tech informed me that there are THREE foreign objects inside of my small bowel. When I told him about the capsule studies, he confirmed that that is what he saw - all THREE of them from over this past year, stuck inside me.\n\nI'm waiting on the doctor's office to receive the report and contact me to see what I need to do from here. So now, I'm not only worried of what condition is causing all of this, but I now have to worry about the 3 capsules inside my small bowel. How did the previous doctor not notice that the capsule came to a halt during BOTH studies and maybe suggest getting an x-ray to make sure I passed them. I feel like a fool for not taking it upon myself to check it out.\n\nMy question is: has anyone ever experienced or heard of anyone having multiple capsules stuck like this? Is this an emergency issue or could it become one? I will be talking to my doctors office tomorrow I'm sure, but in the mean time, I'm a little nervous about everything.","like_count":"0","tags":["Crohn's Disease","Ulcers","Bloating"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/4612/multiple-capsule-endoscopies-stuck"},{"post":{"author":"rumman18","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Depth of Esophagus/Digestive Tracts","post_content":"Hello,\n\nI was wondering what is the average depth of esophagus from the surface of the chest?

It was an unpleasant feeling of course that lasted through the evening with me having no appetite. What I find odd is that it pretty much completely disappears by around 8PM every time! Now about a week later I'm still experiencing this which is why I came here seeking help. I've been spending hours on the internet to find the cause for this but can't seem to figure it out. People say it could be GERD, ulcer, anxiety, parasite etc but I'm not too sure as my symptoms matches every one of those. In addition to the gagging and no appetite, I also feel extremely fatigued all the time and sleep does not help it. I went to the doctors yesterday and he told me it was the \"stomach flu\" and ordered a blood test so I'll see the results in about a week. In the mean time, I've made a list of my lifestyle choices to find the culprit. 1) I'm a frequent marijuana smoker for only a couple months as it helps with my ADD more than Adderall; 2) I've been prescribed Adderall for years but that has never made me feel like this and I prefer marijuana anyways so I don't use it as often; 3) The Adderall makes me skip meals sometimes like once every week; 4) I'm ashamed to say this but I've been downing like 12+ gummy vitamins everyday for the past 2 months (I THINK THIS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT). I've been researching the symptoms of vitamin overdose and it sounds like what I've been having. Could vitamin overdose make me gag in the morning then subside at night and could it affect me for this long (a week)? Like many others who have gag reflex problems, it affects almost every aspect of life and I just want it gone.

Between the migraines and recent diagnosis of venous anginoma. And my skull sits too low on my spine. So, I deal with that. Although, I'm having a hard time dealing with what's going on in my GI track. For the past couple years, drs thought the pain and sickness was from endometriosis And cysts on my ovary. Ok. I get a cyst removed. Not it. A year later, another removed. Later, an ovary removed. Then they decided it's time to remove my female parts. They put me on birth control to help with the cysts. Only for me to get pregnant. Because I'm sick all the time I can hardly take care of the two children I have how am I going to take care of three. But being the person I am I keep the baby. As my tummy grew larger I was about seven months pregnant and I noticed on the ultrasound a huge mass. I asked the ultrasound lady what that was and her response was \"I'm not sure I brought that to the nurses attention last time it looks like it is on your colon, but they said there's nothing they can do about it until baby is born.\" Once baby was born you could not see it anymore I don't know if it's because you could only see it because my stomach was larger or what. Problems continue and then they removed my female parts. Well problems continue but they are actually worse. I am on week three with no bowel movement. I've done for animals to suppositories I've drink the stuff they told me to and nothing. To the hospital twice did their enema and nothing. It feels like I have the flu all the time. It disrupts my life time with my children and my fiancé. And when I don't feel like this I have a migraine. I get weak I lose weight I'm nauseated feverish dizzy lightheaded.

No allergies or intolerances, i loved food and i'd eat an entire jar of edys ice cream within one day. I'd get occassional stomach aches but i would be able to drink some ginger ale and shake it off within a matter of hours. Even that was rare. i've always had anxiety but that never truly affected me.\n\nNow, when i was 15, which was toward the ending of 2013, I caught a really bad stomach virus for the first time. After about a few days i still wasnt able to shake it off and even water was making me sick. WATER. So with that i lost about 10lbs. Which is alot because i am tiny anyhow. I was suffering for WEEKS with nausea vomiting and abdominal pain. Then i finally saw a g.i and planned an endoscopy begining of 2014. They found that my stomach lining had scars due to excessive acid and they pretty much chalked it down to acid reflux. OMEPRAZOLE had little effect and i was on it for months. Then i got allergy tested and it was found that i was lactose intolerant (Never had any problems with dairy before) Switched to an organic diet and i still had bloating and nausea even after eating a little bit. 2015 i was fine. still not 100%, but fine. \n\nLast year 2016 I randomly had an unexplainable flare up around my birthday, March. I was still organic but occasionally i'd cheat. Even grapes and water was making me sick/nauseous and i had severe belly pain. It took me almost two months to feel at least a little well, but the symptom that has stuck with me was early satiety. Even half a sandwhich would make me feel full and bloaty.\n\nFast forward to this past november, i wake up one morning and literally everything made me sick. I tried to force feed myself because I know i have to eat but it only made matters worse and with that, i havent had a full meal since early november. Then i started noticing that food i never had a problem with before, magically became a problem (Such as rice, bread, meat, soup) basically EVERYTHING. i was living off crackers cookies and juice.\n\n\n\nNOW JANUARY,  starting on JANUARY 1ST, i caught ANOTHER BAD STOMACH VIRUS THAT THREW MY SYSTEM FOR A LOOP. I literally havent ate much since then and ive lost 20lbs, now im 99lbs. ive only had water, popsicles, cheerios (which made me sick) and sunflower seeds. I was starting to feel better last friday. I was still nauseous after eating CLEAR SOUP. CLEAR SOUP!!!!!!!. However, one of my doctors insisted that I had functional ibs dyspepsia since every test came out NEGATIVE, she insisted my anxiety was part of the problem, so they decied to prescribe me zoloft 50 mg. BIG MISTAKE. I had the WORST reaction EVER to that stuff and since then, i felt sick to my stomach, dizzy, headachey, twitchy, agitated etc. I havent ate since the night  i took that second dose (friday). Of course I discontinued it but now I feel even more anxious and depressed than ever before. I tried to eat yesturday but my body started feeling sick and i started shaking.  I JUST WANT THIS TO END. ALMOST 4 YEARS OF AGONY AND I WANT IT ALL TO STOP.","like_count":"0","tags":["GERD and Heartburn","Ulcers","Irritable Bowel Syndrome","Bloating","Ulcerative Colitis"]},"responses":[{"author":"sheba_q","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: I am tired of food making me sick.","resp_content":"I suspect what's going on is food intolerance(s).

Nor is it necessarily healthier for you. In fact, in some cases it can be downright dangerous.\n\nThis may seem like a stretch, but have you suffered any kind of emotional duress in the last four or five years? Even something that you may have shrugged off as no big deal? There is truth to the adage, \"When the soul hurts, the body cries out.\" Even if the physical effects don't seem to be linked to the emotional duress. Even if your physical issues are not related to anything emotional, stress, depression and anxiety are horrible to live with. I would still suggest that you seek out the comfort of a mental health counselor or a Psychologist (not a Psychiatrist) to help you deal with the stress from this whole ordeal. I also would agree with you that Zoloft was a big mistake. The most common side effects of Zoloft are the same as the issues that you're trying to get rid of. Since you've only taken two doses of this, I see no harm in immediately stopping. I would suggest talking to your GP about starting Buspirone and possibly adding Klonopin to compliment the Buspirone. These are non-psychotic medicines that help treat anxiety.\n\nIn addition, one thing you mentioned was \"early satiety\" which immediately made me think of Gastroparesis. http://www.healthline.com/health/gastroparesis#Overview1\n\nImportant thing to remember, Doctors don't know it all, and often want to address most situations with the most obvious and common solutions. It's up to you to do your own research and present it to your Doctor. Always think of your relationship with your Doctors as a team effort, always ask question about your treatments and offer your own researched opinions. If your Doctor takes you participation as a threat to his/her authority, time to find another Doctor.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an MD, I am a Mental Health Counselor who has suffered from Major Depression, General Anxiety Disorder and Gastrointestinal disorders for almost 30 years.

It has gotten especially worse for me recently though. I have always had to take a shower immediately following a bowel movement, and that routing usually took 1.5-2 hours. Now the whole thing takes me anywhere from 3.5-5 hours.\n\nAnyways, when I wipe, I use baby wipes. They get me much cleaner and it's much more comfortable on my skin back there than toilet paper or other wipes, which don't get me clean enough. Now at the end of my wiping routine, I am going in deep into my hole, and the wipes either just have blood on them, or they have blood plus a sort of mucus looking clear substance. It's usually spread out no further than the size of a penny, but most of the time it is smaller than that.\n\nSo my question is, what is this clear substance? When I see it on the wipe, it makes me think I am not clean enough, so I have to wipe until I see only blood alone on the wipe, or nothing at all. This has caused my BM/wiping process to get much longer than it used to be. Is there any kind of fecal matter contained in the clear stuff? Is there any reason for me to feel unclean if I were to stop wiping once I only see blood and clear stuff?\n\nFor further information, I will say it's probable that I have some form of IBS, although I have never been diagnosed as such. My BMs are usually solid, although I have the occasional loose stool probably once a week, with diarrhea happening around 3-4 times per month. I frequently have stomach cramps, which I take a GasX in response to, but this seems to have limited efficacy. I recently (as in this past week) started taking a probiotic supplement again. I took a daily probiotic in the past, and it seemed to help somewhat, but I got off of it probably midway through 2016. I tried a different brand, it says it has a billion cultures per serving so I hope that will help me.\n\nAnyways, my main question/concern here is the clear stuff in my anus.

My father died of esophageal cancer that metastasized to other parts of his body at 35 years old. No real history of medication, except for I did take a 6 month dose of Accutane to treat severe acne. This was about 1-2 years ago. So the problem started within this past year.

My mother is a nurse, so we have a habit of just \"toughing it out\", but I am beginning to get a little worried, considering how the problem has progressed and how long it has persisted. When I have a BM I experience a sharp pain in the rectal area, and bright red blood. The bleeding has been getting progressively worse over the past year to the point where tonight, after passing stool, a few drops of blood dripped into the toilet, and there was a substantial amount of blood on the toilet paper. Also, recently i have been able to feel a small bump near the anus. It is fairly small and hard. At first I thought hemorrhoids, but the symptoms only occur when having a BM. No pain, itching, or anything at any other time. This leads me to believe that it may be something more serious! I would be super embarrassed to go to the doctor and it just be hemorrhoids, but I am scared it could be something else.

It all started a month ago when i started to feel pain under my breasts, which I sometimes got from excess acid, but it usually went away after a short while. This time it persisted and I also got back pains(middle/upper back) and abdominal pain(both upper and lower abdomen and also on the sides), as well as nausea. I went to my GP and after palpation she diagnosed me with gastritis and put me on esomaprazone and other acid inhibitors. After two weeks I stopped the treatment and got really bad acid reflux that caused burning in my throat and other GERD symptoms(globus,trouble swallowing etc.) so I went again. She put me on the same drug diet for a while but I got really worked up about everything so she also reffered me to get an endocopy. The back pain didn't go away so I also did an X-ray which showed a flat back?(not sure what the term is in english exactly), and my doc insisted it wasn't related to my GI problems, although I find it really weird it started at the same time. The endoscopy showed gastritis and bile reflux and the doc suggested I get an ultrasound (suspected bile problems) but didn't think it was anything serious going on. Bloodwork was normal, as well as urine tests. The back pain also went away for like a week. A week ago I went skiing and more weird and worrying symptoms started to appear, mainly pain in left side and near my belly-button(around it somehow) which a read can show pancreatic problems. Also my back pain came back after being gone for a while( 1 week?). Left side pain got better but navel pain persisted and now i get random pains sometimes in my abdomen. I've developed crippling health-anxiety and after scares such as pulmonary cancer (read about asociated abdominal pain, and also muscle weakness which I experienced, but the X-ray came out clean) and esophageal cancer, I now fear pancreatic cancer. I didn't do an ultrasound yet (scheduled for one in 3 days) and although I now I'm young but I show a lot of symptoms and it got me so worked up I find myself bursting into tears. My stool has also been lighter than usual (light-brown to yellow-ish) but according to the internet it's normal? not sure where the line is drawn. I've also been more constipated than usual, but at first I didn't pay attention to it since it was listed as a common side effect of one of the drugs I've been taking. I've since got of said drug and although i have a daily stool ( usually 2 times a day) i feel like something isn't right since I used to go more often since all of this started. I have no history of cancer in the family, but i used to be a heavy smoker and drinker before all of this. I eat well and didn't lose weight as of yet. But the digestive problems, back and abdominal pain, pain around belly button and bile problems worry me a lot and I would really appreciate your input.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Diagnosed with gastritis but fearing the worst","resp_content":"try a shrink sound like you are making yourself sick i do the same thing\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/2519/diagnosed-with-gastritis-but-fearing-the-worst"},{"post":{"author":"devinmackenzie","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Long time condition, year into tests","post_content":"Seeking any advice! I am a twenty year old female with long history of various symptoms.\nLet's paraphrase & start at the beginning: I have always had a weak immune system, constantly getting infections or bronchitis as a child. Around age 18, my health began to weaken substantially. At this point my biggest symptoms were exhaustion, ruptured ovarian cysts ( pain so bad putting me at the ER) and the beginning of my GI problems (will elaborate later). In the summer of 2015 at age 19, after an episode of syncope, shortness of breath and constant dizziness, I went to a PC and they forwarded me to cardiology. After extensive testing, they found I had a sporadic tachycardia (reaching 189 bpm at rest) and started me on beta blockers (metoprolol) which eliminated those symptoms.\nIn the beginning of 2016, I visited the PC again after finding a mass in my collarbone area, joint pain and spiking of digestive problems: no appetite (only eating one meal a day), nausea, abdominal pain, constant diarrhea, and blood in stool. After testing they found I had high protein & calcium in my blood and a calcified lung nodule. I was referred to a rhemotologist at the possibility of having lupus or another autoimmune problem, she tested and found high Immunoglobins E and referred me to GI as she said she could do nothing else. I was so thankful for the GI doctor I got, as he apologized for having been passed around so much. Began testing, first colonoscopy/endoscopy, finding irritation and a precancerous polyp but no celiac or crohns. Tested gallbladder, was normal. Did elimination diet to test for food allergies, no significant findings. Have recently had a SIBO breath test and abdominal CT and waiting on results. I am currently taking pantoprazole, IB &FD gard, Carafate, ranitidine, probiotics as well as ondansetron and diclocymine as needed. My condition flares and ceases consistently, and currently the biggest problems are the digestive mentioned above, extreme fatigue (can sleep 11 straight hours, wake up, and three hours later I am exhausted) , cold intolerance, and cough.\nMy family history includes crohns disease, graves disease, heart defects and skin cancer.

It started off with constant burning the burning would be worse after a burp. I tried over counter medicine which didnt work for me at all. My friend with who i went gym with said he has acid reflux and gave me few PPI tablets to try omeprazole which gave me such a great relief. He said he usually takes a course and hasnt got problems for months with me it was different, its been over a year now and if i dont take a tablet i struggle to cope. It usualy takes 2-3 up to a week for the burning to come back after i stop taking the tablet. I also realised that even if i do take a tablet and drink on the weekend i will still wake up with the burning sensation above my stomach as i said its worse when i burp after i burp its like some acid is going out above my stomach. I recently started feeling nauseas i dont know but i also have health anxiety so anything happening to me i think straight away that its cancer. But i read it could be the nausea from taking of the omeprazole. It doesnt happen much sometimes at all sometimes during the day usually around 3-6 oclock i feel this vomiting feeling for some reason. I have also realised that it happend to me twice after heavy drinking i would vomit coffee grounds or some blood but i dont vomit at all if i dont drink. I have read that all that stuff is GERD symptoms. I have been to a doctor after 3 months of taking omeprazole and he had told me that i am too young for cancer ( i am 25) and also to carry on taking the tablets if they do help and prescribed another 3 months course. I am planning to do gastroscopy to see what is happening but with my health anxiety i dont think il be able too im to scared it will turn out something worse than GERD. I started reading on the internet all this stuff about omeprazole masking the actual stomach cancer and i am so scared. However I heard of people having exactly the same symptoms as me.\n\nMy questions is if i do have gerd or i have inflammed esophagus why the long treatment of omeprazole isnt helping? Usually i hear people will take a 2 month course and that would be it. Same with stomach ulcers i read that the symptoms let off after taking the tablets. With me is the way that the tablets do help and sometimes i forget to take the tablet but if i dont take the tablets for couple of days the symptoms come back with the same force like nothing changed. My question is if its stomach ulcer, gerd etc. why do symptoms persist? I am very scared that i have cancer. Although i feel fine as long as i take the tablets.

I am 24 years old and was told I have GERD by a doctor a little over a month ago after experiencing a week + of constant and extreme burning sensations in my stomach/chest, an awful taste in my mouth and morning breath, an increase in burping, a huge increase in saliva production (which I used to associate with the feeling of vomiting) and not being able to stand up straight without feeling worse. My doctor immediately came to the conclusion that I had GERD and prescribed a PPI - 20mg of omeprazole to take once daily, in the morning 30 mins before eating. I have been taking the pills religiously and have made a complete lifestyle change; cut out all food/liquids that I read can irritate my stomach, eating smaller meals more frequently and slowly, been careful to not lay down until at least 2 hours after eating, completely stopped drinking alcohol and all caffeine (except the occasional herbal green tea that is caffeinated). In other words, I feel I have made all the right steps and should be feeling much better... And I was until about 1 week ago... I started to get a tickle in my throat and a runny nose, which at first I just attributed to a regular old common cold. However this cold is different than any other I've experienced; a constant cough and mucus, wheezing in my chest before/during/and after coughing, constant extremely runny nose, the burning pain I experienced before my lifestyle changes & meds in my stomach when coughing, the weird taste in my mouth after coughing/sniffling mucus, occasional but extreme dizziness, and occasional but extreme shortness of breath while talking even at a very low decibel.\n\nSorry I know this is such a long post but I am desperate to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this. I originally thought it was an unrelated sickness but now I feel that my GERD and this freak cold may be linked somehow.

I am a waitress and I am completely embarrassed having these issues while taking care of people & their food and cannot afford to take anymore time off work.

Why am I feeling so bloated? I am also gaining weight and I barely eat anything all day because I am so bloated. I am staying away from breads, fatty food, and processed foods. But still no relief. I am on the fence for getting a colonoscopy because I just don't think it will show anything. I am so frustrating and gaining weight as we speak. I lived with the bloating & pain, but I cannot live with the weight gain.

I think that for many of us here it has been a trial and error process that you describe until you find that one thing that answers your questions.\n\nHave you tried a more strict elimination diet? I also have severe, painful bloating when I eat specific foods (although I have not experienced the weight gain that you are). A friend suggested I start by getting rid of all dairy in my diet, which definitely helped but didn't stop all my bloating. Then I moved on to getting rid of breads and other gluten foods. I also can't eat certain foods like apples, onions (unless they are well cooked), bananas (unless they are blended in smoothies -- weird I know), and others. It took me a long time to identify the foods that trigger my bloating, and I'm still finding new ones. When I do accidentally eat something I shouldn't, my stomach gets painfully hard and I can't do anything but lay on a hard surface and wait for it to go away. Sometimes pulling my knees to my chest and rocking or laying on my stomach and doing the \"superman\" workout move relieves some of the discomfort. I drink something called Calm every night before bed to try and get my BMs regular.\n\nI've seen many doctors and had a couple of colonoscopies -- gone down the route of testing for Crohn's, celiac, etc. My doctors still haven't found an official dianosis -- just an intolerance to a number of foods, maybe IBS? But my experience definitely doesn't mean that a colonoscopy won't find answers for you. I would make sure to talk through the pros and cons of getting one with your doctor.\n\nFor now I'm doing ok managing my symptoms with food while I continue to search for answers. I hope that you find the answers you're looking for soon!\n1\n"},{"author":"vapetlover43","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Severe Bloating, stomach pain, and weight gain","resp_content":"My daughter had this problem, but it was related to her alcohol issues.

From that time on I suffered occasional flares but usually in times of heay stress. About 18 months ago I began to have the flares more often and more severe. I eventually went to a GI doctor who, after a colonoscopy with biopsies came back clear, treated me with Amitiza 8mg, 1 twice a day, Bentyl 20 mg, 1 three times a day, and Ativan, 5 mg, 1 twice a day. This combination worked well for a period of time but then I began to suffer from bouts of diarrhea. It got to where I was moving back and forth between the two extremes most of the time. I asked my regular physician to take over the maintenance of my treatment. He asked me a lot of questions about how I felt and what was a regular routine was like for me. After his examination of my situation he took me off the Bentyl because he thought that it seemed to have made my digestive system too sluggish. He also did a blood panel test and discovered that my thyroid was severly underactive and my Vitamin D was very low. He put me on Synthroid 100 mcg, 1 a day, and Vitamin D3 5000 units, 2 a day. After a couple of weeks I began to see a difference in the way I felt overall. That relieved some of the stress I had been feeling which helped with the IBS.
