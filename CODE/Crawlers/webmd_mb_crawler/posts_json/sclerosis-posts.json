Read this.","post_content":"I felt compelled to write this a year and a half after first experiencing neurological issues because #1, it seems that a lot of folks who have similar undiagnosed conditions simply \"disappear\" online (hopefully that means they've gotten better), and #2, I am still alive after a year and a half, so my goal is to give hope to anyone who is experiencing similar symptoms and have not had any luck with a diagnosis.\n\nFirst things first. If you have not seen any neurologists, stop reading now and don't do any more research until that appointment. Otherwise, you will go through torturous anxiety and sleepless nights as you try to self-diagnose and likely settle on the worst-case scenario. My post is for those who have had all of the tests done and seen multiple doctors and still have no diagnosis.\n\nMy two biggest, longest lasting symptoms were (and occasionally still are) numbness and muscle twitching. It started off as numbness in my left toe, slowly progressing to my left foot, left leg, left arm, left side of the face and even the entire head at times (rarely all at once though). I started getting it in the right side of my body occasionally, but there it typically stayed in my right fingertips. The twitching also appeared in various parts of the body, but really chose to settle in my right arm between my triceps and elbow. It twitched nearly nonstop, 24/7 for 4-5 months straight. While these were the longest lasting symptoms, I encountered a TON of other symptoms. While concerning, these didn’t last months like the numbness and twitching. I will include that list below my signature.\n\nDuring about a year’s time, I had 2 MRIs on my brain and neck, two different EMGs on both sides of the body, strength tests, probably a dozen or so various blood tests, and an EKG. Everything came back clean. I saw 2 different neurologists and 2 different general doctors. None of them could piece anything together. One of my neurologists wouldn't even look at my twitching arm. “If you can do a push up, sit up, and squat, you don't have ALS,” he assured me. So while every doctor failed to come up with what was going on, none of them seemed overly concerned. In a way, it is a relief to know your doctors aren’t concerned. On the other hand, if they don’t know what it is, then how do they know it’s not fatal?!\n\nBefore I move on to what finally “cured” me, I need to pause and say… trust your doctors, esp. if they are all saying the same thing. Spending a few hours or even a few days researching WebMD, message boards, etc., does not put us on the same standing as neurologists who have spent YEARS studying these conditions. You have to trust them and have a little faith, esp. if they are saying you are OK. I also know that none of what I’m saying is truly going to convince you that you might not have a terrible disease - I wasn't able to be convinced at first either. They only thing you can truly do is wait it out.\n\nOK, the good stuff. By a fluke chance, I shared my issues and concerns with a co-worker, who suggested that I see a particular doctor in Houston who has a knack for diagnosing things that other doctors can’t. I didn’t get my hopes up but decided to go see him anyway. He took a look at all of my test results over the past year, sent me for a couple more random blood tests, which came back clean, and then told me that he has seen what I have before. It doesn’t even have a name yet! It is a virus and has a transient nature, which explains why the symptoms manifest in different ways and in different places. Furthermore, it is going to take a couple of more years to fully get it out of my system. Annoying? Yes! But at least he gave me hope, which is something I couldn’t get anywhere else. He told me that it’s hard to do, but if I could find a way to laugh with the twitching, to do so (I know, that is impossible), because while with some diseases, twitching is a bad thing, in this case, it is a good thing and is my body’s way of rewiring itself so to speak. So, I’m still not filling confident at this point, but he said he wants to start me on prescription grade magnesium (Mag Oxide, 400 mg), and that if that doesn’t help with the twitching, that he had a less conventional idea. Well, to my surprise, one or two days after taking the magnesium, the twitching stopped almost completely! Mind you, none of my previous tests showed any sort of magnesium deficiency. As a side note, I will still get random twitches every now and then, but they are usually short-lived and nothing more than just a few seconds. But the nonstop twitching has been gone for probably 8 months or so. (I still wonder what his other idea would have been if the magnesium wouldn’t have worked!)\n\nSo anyway, if you are in the same boat as I am/was, not finding any results and all of your tests coming back clean, ask your doctor if he can try you on a high dosage of magnesium. You certainly don’t have anything to lose.\n\nI want to end this with some self-reflection that has come out of this ordeal with me. This was an extremely scary season for me and forced me to ask some tough questions about life and what really matters. What I learned was whether I have a neurological disease now or not, the fact remains that at some point, I AM going to die. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if that happens while I am young, middle-aged, or old... the same fate awaits us all. Depressing, yes, but true nonetheless. If you are battling an unknown condition and have extreme anxiety and fear, my advice is to take this time and current health scare to settle the score now. Are you religious? Find out what you truly believe and hopefully this strengthens your faith in the end. Religious or not, try to find beauty in the day to day and focus each day on what truly matters. If and when you come out of this ordeal, be it a year or longer, come back and share your story with others to give them hope. And please don't forget those who truly are suffering with serious diseases such as ALS. Pray for them, encourage them, donate to ALS research, volunteer your time, etc. All the vows you made and said you'd do if only you didn't have the fatal disease? Do them. With whatever time you have left, love God and love others and leave the world a better place.\n\nGood luck!\nDC\n\nOther symptoms besides numbness and muscle twitching:\n\nLong lasting: High blood pressure; rash in left armpit that lasted months but eventually went away; Left leg tingly, almost like an internal vibration; Psychological issues (Anxiety, Stress, Detached feeling, Overwhelmed, Fear)\n\nShorter lived: Sensation of lump in my throat, slow swallowing, sometimes with a dull pain that came and went; Muscle and joint pain (shoulders, calves, right arm, muscle near thumb on right hand, finger joints); Waking up with right little and ring fingers completely numb; Electric jolt-like feeling in right side of neck; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Insomnia; Fatigue; Palpitations; Light headed; Stammering for words; Neck pain; Chest pains","like_count":"1","tags":["Symptoms","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"2 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Numbness, muscle twitching, and no diagnosis?

It first started in 2016 when I got a headache that felt like it was cracking my head open, just after the headache started I battled to look at any lights. This got increasingly worse and I started getting a fever. I was exhausted and could not stay awake. About 3 hours later I went to the doctor. They admitted me into hospital straight away suspecting meningitis. I was put on meds and given a cortisone injection. The symptoms were better but the headache did not go away for a couple of days. The doctors did a Lumbar Puncture and the results showed a high white blood cell count but it was just below what was required for meningitis. After 2 weeks I was pretty much back to normal and didn't think about it again. In 2017 I then started getting tonsilitis once a month for about a year and eventually they removed my tonsils. (I'm not sure if this in anyway related). After the tonsil removal I have felt constantly tired and this has not stopped. In September 2018 I got a severe headache again as well as a sensitivity to light (The sensitivity was not as severe this time but the headache was just as bad). The headache stayed for 3 days and then I started getting fever sweats and chills alternatively. I went to the doctor and tick bite fever was suspected, I was put on antibiotics and seemed to be a bit better but still had fatigue. A couple of days later my pinky and ring finger on my right hand started tingling and this worsened so I went back to the doctor and they said I had tennis elbow so put me on anti-inflammatories. A week or so later the tinglign worsened and moved to both my hands (all fingers) and my feet (all toes). I also started shaking severly throughout my entire body. A couple of days later, one side of my face went numb and I could not raise my one eyebrow or move my mouth on that side. The face paralysis only lasted 3 days. I also had very stiff muscles. I went to the doctor and they referred me to the physio. The physio refused treatment and sent me to the neurologist. The neurologist did a full blood count, lumbar puncture, MRI, a nerve conduction stud and an EEG. The only results outside of normal ranges were the inflammation markers in the blood tests, the white blood cell count was only slightly above normal and the nerve conduction study picked up an irregularity between my elbow and hand on my right hand. The neurologists suspects Multiple Sclerosis and is going to retest in a years time. In December 2018 I then went to a homeopath who put me on a high dosage of magnesium as well as a variety of other vitamins. This subtantially helped all the symptons. The numbness and shaking is almost completely gone now and only comes back very occassionally. I have not been taking any tablets for a couple of months now and feel ok. The only thing that I still battle with is the muscle stiffness and the fatigue. I have also noticed a significant increase in visability of my veins since December 2018 and this is worsening over time (not sure if this is relevant).\nCan anyone help me with a diagnosis and treatment?","like_count":"0","tags":["Living & Managing","Symptoms","Treatment","Diagnosis"]},"responses":[{"author":"chavezj43","resp_time":"2 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Diagnosis","resp_content":"I have similar symptoms, with negative MRI’S.

Although the two may seem like the perfect twins, well they are not. This whole dilemma regarding the two plants is, most likely, the result of many games that media plays just to work for some God knows what political interests of some highly positioned individuals.","resp_content":"\nEither way, people deserve to know clear and concise information related to this difference which is extremely important because there are some great health benefits that you might want to know about.\n\nThe Indian hemp, also known under the name Cannabis sativa forma indica, is a variety of the common hemp. This plant is used towards many purposes, including also industrial ones. So Indian hemp can be substantially used for making ropes or even sacks. People have always praised hemp as being a perfectly natural and safe for the skin fabric which can successfully replace other synthetic materials. It is indeed more expensive, but it lasts longer and is safer for the skin, with all the sweating and allergies that happen nowadays.\n\nThis Indian hemp comes from Central Asia, but nowadays it is also cropped in Himalaya, Colombia and Jamaica, Eastern Europe and Holland. First mentioning regarding this plant’s cropping was made on the Chinese territories almost 3000 years ago. People were using back then as a medicine for rheumatism and malaria. Things did not change in the present days because there are still people who firmly believe in its curing properties and so many products have been brought to the market consisting of decent amounts of hemp oil, but this is something we will be discussing later on.\n\nMoving on to cannabis, there are some things we need to clarify you with. The name, also known as marijuana, is given to a blend of flowers, leaves and young bodies of the Indian hemp. The term “marijuana” comes from the Spanish language’s slang talked through ought Mexico and from here it rapidly spread all around the Hispanic areas, and afterward in the entire world.\n\nSo it is a sort of updated Indian hemp, thought to provide different effects for the consumer. Some of these effects represent the main reason due to which in some parts of the world, this plant, even its cropping is not legal… yet.\n\nOne particular difference worth to be mentioned and a significant one is the fact that both types of plants contain cannabinoids but in different amounts. So Indian hemp is considered to include approximately 60 chemical compounds, each with a certain psycho active effect, more or less powerful. These compounds are called cannabinoids, and these exist in both plants. For the Indian hemp, CBD is the most important compound, and researchers talk about it as not having any psycho active effects on the human brain.\n\nIn fact, many studies have revealed that cannabidiol has so many health benefits that people deserve to know about. In what THC is concerned, the psycho active compound which can give you that feeling of “high,” is equal to almost zero in certain types of hemp. So choosing it will not make you a drug addict or law- breaker.\n\nIn what marijuana or cannabis is concerned, here we need to mention that the attention goes to the THC amount. This means that this substance is extracted from a particular combination of plants cropped in a certain way, following certain principles so that nothing of the THC is lost. These species of plants also contain CBD, but the fact that THC plays the primary role is somehow covering all the health benefits that cannabidiol can offer.\n\nThe answer is quite simple: it all depends on what you want to get. You can either turn to hemp oil for a whole range of health benefits, or to cannabis oil, for recreational purposes. So it is all up to you.\n\nThe thing is that hemp oil will never make you feel high or make laugh more and all those effects you might have already seen or heard about in certain movies or documentaries. Hemp oil can also be used in various cosmetic therapies, in cooking and do not worry: those brownies I bet you are thinking about, if you make them with hemp oil, will not make you giggle at everything you hear or say.\n\nCannabis oil, however, is something you need to think about. First of all, it is not legal in all countries, so you will need to look that up if you are planning to give it a try. In comparison with hemp oil, this one will certainly have other effects on you and not the good ones, I can tell you. The essential idea to bear in mind is that you need to understand that both can do you good, as well as bad, like any other substance you give to your body. What you need to do is to know all there is to know about your health state, about your body and according to this information you can decide whether one of these oils can do you any good or not.\n\nMany researchers have dedicated a lot of time studying the two, and so we have at our disposal even scientific proof that these can influence our functioning systems either in a good or a bad way.\n\nSome of my resources:\n\nhttps://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=a0a046c1-056d-45a9-bfd9-13b47c24f257\nhttps://hlbenefits.com/cbd-vs-thc\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969077/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/\n"},{"author":"marlonkelley","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Interactions between Remicade and Cannabis","resp_content":"Cannabis is an extremely safe herb with no toxic effects or overdose potential.

I had blurry vision and had weird bladder sensations, like not knowing when I had stopped going. Lots of weirdness before being diagnosed. I also had the \"MS hug\", a squeezing sensation around my ribs that a regular neurologist didn't recognize as an MS symptom. I wasn't diagnosed until my walking was affected...weakness and foot drop in my left leg. I wished I had known sooner so I could have started treatment earlier; I'm pretty much disabled now; can't walk on my own anymore.

But I will appologise for how long this might be before hand.\n\nI am a 23yo, female.\nHad a Microdiscectomy and Laminectomy when I was 18 and recovered with no deficits whatsoever.\n\nAround April last year (2018) so started to get a few symptoms of sciatica and some numbness of the outside of my left foot. I saw my doctor and had a scan. It's showed a small protrusion, and bone spurs. I was referred back to my neurosurgeon and whilst waiting I started to lose the function of my left foot.\nWhen I arrived to see my Neurosurgeon, he admitted me straight away for further testing.\nI had nerve conduction study which showed damage/not a lot of capacity and some radiculopathy of course. But Neurology and neurosurgery said that the protrusion didn't explain the loss of function in that area and that my reflex was diminished but they would operate again. So last year around October, I had surgery again to fix the protrusion (l5.s1) as that was the only possibility causing the numbness and reduced function... or so we thought.\n\nMoving on, after the surgery... I seemed to just slowly get worse. The numbness has spread to my knee now, only leaving the inside of my leg with some feeling.\nMy Achilles reflex is completely absent, and I have a dropped foot and issues controlling my leg.\nI returned back to my Neurosurgeon after 6 weeks and he said my lumbar MRI looked normal now and he couldn't understand why my function wasn't improving. He said he was sorry and that he thinks I may have a neurological disorder, or possibly a single tumor causing the problems. We went through some other symptoms that I've had (you know... Those ones that come and go that you don't usually link together) such as numbness in one finger, Numbness at the back of my arm. Weak grip, short headaches, visual problems when I stare at the floor, pain in my back when I put my chin to my chest, and a heap of memory issues (I had electroconvulsive therapy for depression about 4 months before my leg symptoms started and we had attributed the memory loss to this)\nAnd twitching muscles every day. The surgeon just threw MS om the table...\n\nI am just confused as surely if I had MS, the surgeon would at least be able to see lesions in the lumbar part of my spine (where I have had a few MRIs)\nIf they are just in my brain, would that cause the leg problems? Can they be microscopic and cause problems? I didn't get to ask questions as I took up so much time, and had to leave.\n\nI am waiting to see my Neurosurgeon once more after I have a nerve conduction study with neurologist coming up and see them too of course (I'm in a really long waiting public system and live 7 hour drive away from the nearest proper hospital)\nI'm trying not to worry myself... and what will be will be.

I have not been diagnosed with MS and don't have a family history that I am aware of. However, I seem to have most of the symptoms associated with the disease. My memory is horrible; I can forget what a topic of a conversation was after a small pause and will often forget why I was trying to figure out something in my head, for example this morning I was trying to figure out how much I get paid per day at my job and as soon as I had the simple equation in my mind I forgot why I was doing the math. I remembered after something else slipped my mind in the same way, which I can't remember what it was. I have the worst insomnia. I get tired quickly through physical activity. Taking a shower often takes all the energy out of me and I have to force myself to finish tasks if I have multiple to accomplish. Once I'm done I will be down for the rest of the day. If I get hot I almost immediately feel dizzy and nauseated. I have a headache every day. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and take medication for those. My balance is not the best. I often trip on flat ground because I just don't lift my foot high enough. Along with that I am very clumsy. I run into door jams or tables, as well as other things, because I misjudge the space I have to go between or how sharp of a turn to make. I easily drop things for no reason. My legs easily move when I need to walk and I have no issues moving body parts when I need to. My vision is bad and I wear prescription glasses, although I have had this problem since I was in my teens and most of my relatives also wear glasses. My prescription does get slightly worse every year, however. I will not realize that my, (often left leg/foot) is asleep until after I try to walk on it. My balance is bad, especially when attempting to exercise. (I will lose balance while doing squats despite having arms stretched out and a straight back after 10 or so, for example.) Yoga is very hard solely due to balance. My strength and flexibility is improving through yoga but my balance is where it was day 1. I have a couple things I am not sure are associated but I wonder if could be: I don't have any numbness in my limbs or extremities other than the falling asleep thing described above. However, I have a weird numbing sensation in my back on the left in a very specific location, which sort of feels like a tingling sensation from like a light fabric being repeatedly brushed over the area. Quite a few months ago I had the same sensation on the right side. The last thing I am experiencing has to do with my bladder. I don't have incontinence or accidents. I actually have the opposite problem , I will unequivocally have a full bladder and as soon as I sit on the toilet, I am unable to go. It takes several minutes and when I do, the stream is weak and I have to use all the strength I have to squeeze the urine out of my bladder. During the time I am urinating if I try to just let it flow, I will stop. This is more likely to happen after I have been holding it, or don't have fluids in my system to help ease it along, such as in the middle of the night or first thing in the morning. During the day, as I drink water throughout the day, I easily go, frequently. I'm talking every 30 minutes to an hour for the first half of my day, even if I am just sipping the water. I understand that that, as well as many of the symptoms I described can be associated with many things. I just want to know if the problems with the numbness in my back and emptying my bladder could be associated with MS along with everything else I described. How should I approach my doctor with these symptoms and my suspicions? Could I have just fallen into the rabbit hole when I was trying to figure out why I can't pee and why my back has that weird tingling? Should I wait and see if my symptoms get worse?\n\nThank you for reading and I appreciate replies.

Personally I have all that you mentioned and some more. If you want to see a neurologist, you can get a referral from your primary care doc. Has your primary care doc at least done a physical neuro exam? That's where they check your balance, reflexes, coordination, and vision. If you get the neurologist referral, diagnostic tests for MS include blood work that will rule out many other conditions with like symptoms, as well as brain and spine MRIs, evoked potentials, and a lumbar puncture to test the spinal fluid for signs of inflammation. Hope this helps--and that you can find some answers and relief very soon. --Kim\n"},{"author":"curious_lady","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Is it worth mentioning to my doctor?","resp_content":"Thank you, that does help.

The past year has been awful for me. This may be a long post because I haven't been able to really talk to anyone about this and how it is affecting me because when I first start to say something about it people usually shrug it off and say I am just tired or being lazy. With that said, here it goes. About 10 year ago, I started having difficulty dealing with cold. My hands started to turn really red. I just shrugged it off because I just thought that was a normal thing. This progressed through the years and now my fingers turn completely white, numb, and painful. I did find out this past February (after going to the dr for other symptoms) that I have Raynauds. I just want to say real quick here that I don't normally go to the doctor unless everything I try at home won't work. Three years ago, I had this black circle appear in my vision in my right eye. It was so annoying and lasted two and a half months. The eye had a bit of a yellowish tint to it and what appeared to be a raised area between the iris and the outer corner of my right eye. It also felt like there was something in it. After I freaked out, I called my eye doctor and went in to have it checked. He said he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary and sent me to a specialist. Same response from the specialist and was given eye drops for dry eyes. This went away after two and a half months. I didn't think much of it after that. This past year it has come back a few different times. By searching online I come to find out that it is called a stocoma. My current dr said that the reason the eye doctor and specialist couldn't find anything is because it is neurological. I kept getting sick easy about a year ago and was going to the dr about every three months for the cold, ear infection, and the flu. So my current dr sent me to a rheumatologist and they did some auto immune tests and they came back showing something was going on but still no diagnosis. I was sent home with a rx of vitamin d (which my current dr and I was unhappy with because my vitamin D levels were good). Then I woke up one morning in so much pain in my back last year the I couldn't even get out of bed. I was literally in tears. Had to call my mom to have her take the kids to school for me and come back and take me to the dr. I ended up at a neuro and spine surgeon and two MRIs and xrays later was told I have two degenerative discs (one in my tail bone and one in my neck). Then the nerve pain. I have had what feels like a needle prick in three different places on my head. This has been going on for a couple of years. It starts out as a quick needle prick and then spiderwebs out into a numbing sensation. These are quick and come and go. I have had constant numbness, tingling, and pain since about February of last year. This affects my arms, hands, feet, and legs. It affects my walking. I also have a constant pain going down from the top of my left thigh to the knee on the backside. Was sent for a nerve conduction and after the forth time she shocked me I told her I couldn't go through with it. It felt like sticking your finger in an electrical outlet. It was horrible! I am completely exhausted and tired all of the time. Sometimes to the point it will hit me so fast and all I can do is lay down. I also have insomnia and getting 4 hours of straight sleep is a good day. Then there is the cognitive issues. It started out as being a little forgetful. Sometimes I open the pantry door and find that I had put the milk in there or I open the fridge door and find the bag of sugar in there. I caught myself the other day in the act of putting my dirty dish in the fridge when I was actually going to put it in the dishwasher. This just happens every once in a while. If my kids have something going on like a dance performance they have to remind me everyday up until the day of. Even when it is written on the calendar I keep up in the dining room. I have speech issues. Sometimes I can't find the right word to use (even if it is a common one). I usually describe the item and add the word \"thingy\" after it. Like if I can't think of the word scissors I will say that little hand held cutting thingy. This happens a bit more often than I would like to admit. Some words I say have an extra letter in them that are not supposed to be there. The other day the letter z slipped in a word of one of my sentences. A few years ago, I told my daughter when she was finished eating lunch to through her paper plate in the garbage and her fork in the \"toaster\". I clearly meant the \"sink\". I even knew in my head I was going to say sink but to my surprise the word toaster rolled out of my mouth. When this started it was weird but we all thought it was kind of funny. Happened a few more times over the course of three weeks and then I was fine again. Now I struggle with my words throughout the day. My kids think it is still funny when I struggle to say something and I usually just shrug it off as normal for me now. I don't let them know that it really is frustrating to me. I was diagnosed with vertigo in February and am on Mecklezine now which it does help. I am also on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was on Gabapentin but it seemed to not work. I have been on Lyrica for three weeks now and can actually move more and it has helped so much with my nerve pain. I am truly thankful to have it right now. I also get a tight feeling around my lower rib cage that goes all the way around my back. It feels like a giant snake is wrapped around me and squeezes me so tight. Feels like my insides are being crushed into my spine. The worst one I had woke me up in the middle of the night I ended up in the fetal position in the middle of my bedroom floor in tears for two and a half hours. I get them here and there any time of day. But in the past year I have actually had them during work, which makes things extremely difficult. I also trip over nothing and have a hard time going up stairs. I have fallen three times in the past few years because my right leg from the knee down feels non-existent. There is a few more things but I am going to leave it at that for now. I just feel so frustrated because I have been dealing with the worst of this since last year. It is affecting my work and I have taken off so many days. I am sure they are thinking I am just lazy. I don't want to lose my job. It is a really good one and I worked so hard to get it. I even got a bachelor's degree so it would give me a leg up in the hiring process. But I am falling apart and the doctor's seem to take forever to tell me what is causing all of this. I need a diagnosis and proper paperwork to take into my boss so that they know what is going on. For now I just tell them that if I have to wait for a diagnosis so do they. Which, in all honesty, is not the best thing to say. Without the proper paper work I must look like a lazy person who is making up things. I just don't know where to go from here.

None are specific to MS and some are not at all indicative of MS. You've had several different procedures that could cause some of the symptoms.

If you are set on pursuing a neurological possibility, then seek out an MS specialist, they are more experienced at spotting possible MS symptoms and will want to hear your symptom history.

My body is getting worse every year (usually around this season). My mom was diagnosed with MS in the 90's but hers is not progressive. I have seen multiple doctors for multiple things and no one knows what's wrong with me. I'm not a hypochondriac and believe that all of these things are related, not separate problems.\n\nEverything escalated in 2011 when I was diagnosed with optic neuritis. I had just had my son (4th child) in Sept of 2010 before experiencing a 6 month localized headache. After 6 months of suffering from the intense pain in my left eyebrow, I realized I could touch it and trigger the pain in a specific area. My doc gave me a low dose steroid and it went away eventually. Around this time, I began experiencing sensations of water dripping on me...like water dripping on my arm or the top of my foot. I'd go to wipe it and there was nothing there.\n\n2012 began the \"pulling\" searing pain in my neck (down into my back), the tops of my hands and the tops of my feet. At random moments without warning, it feels like an electric shock sensation \"pops\" and is followed by a hot sensation. Sometimes it feels like a tendon gets \"hung up\" and snaps. It's frustrating esp when I'm driving and just \"looking both ways\" or turning to talk to someone. I go through several months with no episodes but typically when they come back, they are frequent, unpredictable and last a few months. That same year, I lost all feeling in my right hand - my pinky, ring finger and half of my palm up through my thumb - which felt like pins and needles half of the time and a dead hand the other. I also started to experience my left hand falling asleep. I could not grip a pencil to even write like normal. I also had a very hard time going down steps because of my knees. My doctor ordered a CAT scan of my head to see if there were legions. It came back mostly clean with the exception of one spot which was inconclusive. I was referred to a neurologist who did nothing for me (he barely spoke to me, just pulled on my arms, banged on my knees and I left). He ruled out MS because I could touch my chin to my chest without triggering any pain. By this point, they decided my hand issues were probably carpal tunnel. The feeling in my hand began to return after a year. For the most part, most of my symptoms were gone.\n\nCome Fall the next year, they returned along with very irregular and heavy menstrual cycles which made me anemic. in 2014 my bladder problems began, along with mild digestive issues. I began getting UTIs quite regularly despite my efforts to avoid them. These moved quite quickly into my kidneys, hospitalizing me with a double kidney infection and potassium deficiency. My doctor ordered a cystoscopy to make sure I was able to completely empty my bladder. Everything came back normal.\n\nAt this point, everything began to occur at the same time. The pins and needles in my limbs, twitches and spasms in random places including my face, back, legs, and hands; numbness, bladder infections, stomach problems, shocking sensations, joint pain. Then, they'd subside for months.\n\nLast year, I developed a very stiff neck and sciatica in both my neck and lower back...sometimes at the same time. I thought I had just slept wrong but a year and several chiropractic adjustments later, it's still stiff and painful and I don't have to be doing anything for my sciatica to flare up. My husband and I were in the store one day and my sciatic nerve in my lower back sent a searing sensation that caught me off guard (I wasn't moving, just standing there talking) and my husband caught me as I began to fall. 2016 I began struggling gripping with my hands again. My doc ordered a test for arthritis which was negative. Only days later, I was sitting on the couch when my right thigh and calf muscle cramped immensely causing me to jump up and I couldn't walk...the calf felt like it could have been a blood clot, which scared me and concerned my doc so she ordered an ultrasound of my leg. It came back fine. That September, I was exercising like I always do and 2 days later, both of my wrists felt fractured. My left wrist healing within a few months while my right wrist got worse, sending me yet again to the hospital. Xray showed no break but they couldn't rule out a hairline fracture. My right wrist is still sensitive and requires a brace from time to time, especially while I sleep.\n\nI began getting very sick every time I would eat and became severely constipated regardless of how clean my diet was. I have never struggled with irregularities at all. My doc referred me to a gastro doc who diagnosed me with IBS and introduced me to the FODmap Diet. This diet cuts out fermenting foods to avoid bad gasses in the stomach. This helped but did not correct the constipation or fullness. To this day, everything I eat won't digest properly or break down. I eat no dairy, no gluten, very little sugar or starchy foods and only drink water. I even tried a 15-day colon cleanse vitamin and couldn't use the bathroom at all by day 4 and the cramps were unbearable.\n\nThis year has been the worst. I now suffer with all of these things plus bladder and bowel issues and can't eat anything without getting sick. Within the past few weeks, my face \"contracts\" (tightens starting in my nose then intensifies over my whole face from my nose upward and subsides) and I can't put my head down too far without experiencing an electric shock sensation shooting down my neck to about the bottom of my shoulder blades. At random moments lately, my whole back tightens and I can't move until it subsides. It feels like an intense \"contraction\". I recently developed neuritis again. My continued menstrual problems led me to an appointment with my gynecologist. She did an ultrasound to find that my uterus is flipped and I have a fibroid tumor which is causing the anemia and heavy bleeding. She said the constipation is a result of my uterus putting pressure on my rectum so she scheduled me a hysterectomy but I am going to cancel it on the advice of my family doctor. He says a uterus cannot cause that kind of restriction.\n\nI'm the lead singer of a rock band. On the last 2 shows of tour in September, I forgot my lyrics in the middle of the songs. During both trips, there were bouts where I was trying to talk to friends or fans and knew what I was trying to say but I couldn't get my sentences right or think of some of the words. It became so frustrating that I stopped talking altogether.\n\nI had a really rough trip to a particular festival in September. I pretty much stayed in the van all day until we performed that evening. I had a burning sensation in my stomach, couldn't walk a straight line (dizzy, fatigue, loss of balance....but I didn't eat much that day due to stomach upset). I took 6 tums, 2 gas-x pills and an over the counter nausea medicine that day..nothing brought relief. It resolved on it's own after 3 days.\n\nYesterday morning, I woke up feeling like my gut was on fire. I couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I drove myself to the ER. The pain intensified and subsided every 5-10 minutes and made me very nauseous as well as sending a searing pain through my lower right back. This went on for 6 hours and I literally wanted to die...or cut my stomach out! They checked my blood and urine, did an ultrasound of my gallbladder, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Everything came back fine so they concluded that it's probably just the IBS.\n\nMy doc is ordering a scope to see my stomach and check for celiac, ulcers, crohn's etc. It very well could be one of these things. I came home from the hospital yesterday and experienced loss of bowel control. I soiled my pants and didn't realize until it was too late. I did the same thing this morning which is why I decided to post here. I'm so embarrassed but desperate for answers. I have been constipated for a year and now I have diarrhea (which could be a side effect of the IBS meds they gave me. But, my doc said it would take 2 weeks to take effect...it had only been 2 days).\n\nObviously I don't WANT a disease of any kind! But I'm tired of going between different specialists to be told there's nothing wrong with me. I want answers so I can start an effective treatment plan.

I'm assuming there is more to why your family doctor's advise. Now this I know about. If any part of your blood work is not with in limits you can have all kinds of problems. Now I really hope you take my advise on this matter. I can have one bout of diarrhea and my potassium becomes low, and it will cause all kinds of havoc. I have learned to watch mine. I think your age is a deciding factor in some of these specialist diagnoses. You didn't mention whether you take any kind of medication. Some meds will cause a lot of trouble. If you are some one who will not take even take an aspirin you might need to rethink that. I assume that you play a string instrument. If so you very well my have carpal tunnel. If so, get it fixed. And if you been playing for long it's worth going thru the surgery. (But don't do the Brown procedure unless your doc has one foot in the grave.) I hope I don't get in trouble for using a brand name so to speak of. I have bowel problems but mine is caused by bariatric surgery. Last thing I want to say. My sister went through some of the same symptoms of electrical shots all over her body. She too was sent for a scan of her brain. Same dx, but one or two more legions. The rest of her workup came back low potassium. I also have read different articles trying to figure out what my symptoms could be. Fibromyalgia fits sometimes.

You may/not have it.\n* UTIs/bladder infections: I have had success with cranberry tablets (I like TruNature brand at Costco)\n* Some meds can destroy part of your intestines (diarrhea, leaky gut). A gluten-free diet has helped me. Hopefully, it's temporary.\n* Sugar: causes inflammation that seems to turn a regular irritation into a fireball of pain for me.\n* Nightshades: a type of plant/flower that can cause an allergic (?) reaction (bowels) to seemingly harmless foods that I had eaten my whole life (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, etc.)...& yes, that includes fries & ketchup.\n* I try to stay as cool as possible...keeps the inflammation at bay...& eyes performing properly.\n\nI wish you the best in all of this.

I too have had the pain behind the eyebrow that becomes too intense for words. I also have the \"water torture\" feeling of someone dripping something on the tops of my feet. Neither of these items has been resolved by my MDs. I also have bouts of losing feeling in my hands or having them \"fall asleep\" - or perhaps going into a coma is more apt. The MDs just shrug their shoulders after checking my heart and vascular system and finding no problems that they expect to find. I am also a musician who plays stringed instruments. When one MD tried to claim my problem was carpal tunnel, I nearly used my guitar as a club to convince him he was mistaken. Unfortunately, I find that MDs will always jump to the easiest response when they're stumped rather than looking deeper.\n\nThat being said - YOU are in charge of your own diagnosis and treatment. The MDs work for you - not the other way around. Don't accept the easy response and if you have to talk to 10 different MDs, just do it until you get the help you need. I also had a neurologist that said I couldn't have MS, but I insisted on trying an MS med. When three weeks later my symptoms subsided I once again picked up the guitar and dared him to tell me it was just a placebo effect.\n\nI have found that controlled breathing exercises help to manage vascular inflammation and decrease the \"water dripping\" feeling. Gentle massage, stretching and VERY light weight lifting exercises help to ward off the \"falling asleep\" of the hands and forearms. I find that the problems with lyrics and speaking is a slippery slope. Once the problems start, I too stop talking until I can calm down and compose myself. Again - breathing exercises help quite a bit.\n\nOn the IBS side, I'm afraid I can't assist aside from saying that diet is key to both these symptoms and IBS. Ironically, I had IBS until my MS issues started and they have abated for the most part. I'm happy not to deal with that, but the price is a bit steep.\n\nKeep looking for alternatives - keep asking questions - and don't accept easy answers - I know it's hard, but try to stay positive.

I am 36 yrs and have been experiencing the majority of my symptoms for 4 years, and looking back, even have some symptoms that I started experiencing in my early 20s. We have a history of Ms in our family on my dad's side. His mom had it very severely, my aunt and uncle (his brother and sister) also both have me. I know there are different kinds of Ms, as I often compare notes with my aunt over her symptoms and those that my grandmother went through. Some are the same, some different. All the same, I have some of the more severe symptoms in our family and yet I have yet to find a doctor to take me seriously. I too have been diagnosed with anything but Ms, starting with carpal tunnel, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, and diabetes..even with the added bonus of my doctor accusing this all of being in my head, until she saw my hands lock up. Yet I still am not entirely taken seriously by doctors.\nI don't know about the water dripping sensation, but I often deal with long lasting headaches/migraines. I have a horrible sensitivity to hot and cold... hot is an absolute no go...and cold is ok, as long as it's not freezing, yet being outside during the winter for 20 minutes or longer causes swelling. Cool showers are my only option. I have times when my hands completely lock up... sometimes it's painful, sometimes it's just there (figured out on my own that there were spasms contracting in my hands for this). I almost always have a tingling sensation...and then I have times of numbness or what I refer to as electric shock running through my feet, arms and legs, often cramping up the muscles, causing no use or limited use of that limb. I have experienced sensations of pressure in my head that makes me feel like a newborn baby (like my head is too heavy to hold up) but if I lean back on pillows or in a chair, the pressure triples in the area touching said pillow or chair. On and off lack of bladder and bowel control, eye twitches (which we've started to recognize as starts to flare-ups), neck pain, back spasms, I could go on and on... And yet not getting anywhere with doctors. I have even experienced a seizure this year and stroke like symptoms (droopy face and everything), yet these don't get called what they are...they are just un-named episodes.\nI hope you find the answers you are searching for...

I'm Lisa (46 years old) and I just joined. I'm seeking feedback about my medical issues because I'm beginning to wonder if I might have MS. I went to my doctor in November of 2016 because of stabbing pains in the back of my head (left side). She ordered imaging and the CT and MRI showed a large (2+ inch) lesion in my pituitary. It deforms my optic chiasm and encases arteries, etc., so I was referred to a neurosurgeon. He diagnosed it as an arachnoid cyst and told me it's congenital and I've had for a very long time. It also revealed that I have chiari malformation. Both the cyst and the chiari malformation were noted to be \"incidental findings\" by the neurosurgeon. He contacted my local eye doctor to have a visual field test done, which came back with defects in both eyes but primarily in the right eye. I was also referred to a neurologist for the head pains, which by then had moved to my eyes, forehead and other parts of my head. I was also having stinging in my head (in sort of a helmet distribution) that felt like tiny bee stings. I was diagnosed with occipital and trigeminal neuralgia which I'm currently taking gabapentin for. Because my visual field test was abnormal and because of the large cyst, my local eye doctor scheduled two VEP tests and another visual field test. He wouldn't say anything specific.. only \"I just want to make sure this isn't progressing\". The first VEP showed \"normal\" results but they were unable to get a clear signal on my right eye so the results were less than reliable. I return to my neurologist for a follow-up appointment. I had started having painless spasms in my legs so she ordered an EMG and nerve conduction study. Those were done the same day and showed normal findings so they ruled out ALS and other peripheral nerve possibilities. She was also concerned about my visual field test results. I was referred to another eye doctor who had another visual field test done and my right eye showed even more defects (mostly peripheral). She referred me to a neuro ophthamologist in case the defects are because of the cyst in my head. I have that appointment next month. I returned to my local eye doctor for the next VEP and this time they were able to get a good connection on both eyes (green signal) with two technicians working together. The VEP results were very strange. It showed only a reading for the low contrast on one eye and only high contrast for the other eye but not vice versa. The P100 did not register at all. It says \"P100 not identifed, abnormal VEP response\". The doctor was baffled with the results and said that there might be a latency but it's unclear. The doctor told me to take the printout with me to the neuro opthamolgist in June. I sent the VEP results to my neurosurgeon and my neurolgist. The neurosurgeon said that the VEP is not because of the cyst. The neurologist said, \"The VEP is not related to the conditions you are currently being treated for in our office\". I have a follow-up brain MRI in July to see if the cyst has grown as well as other possible changes. My neurologist scheduled me for three days after the MRI in case of any changes that might affect my treatment. After all of the reading I've done, I'm wondering if I might have MS. I have a shocking jolt (not really painful but uncomfortable) that goes down my spine when I bend my head too far forward (possiblly Lhermitte's sign?). I get extremely tired sometimes and can barely force myself to do basic housework. I might have more energy for a day or so and then I'm exhausted again without warning. I'm having issues with bladder control which began about 2 months ago. I've also had palatal myoclonus for 20+ years. So, with the trigeminal neuralgia, fatique, bladder issues, myoclonus, and possible Lhermitte's sign.... does it seem possible that I have MS?

I am not a neurologist, but I used to be an RN. My MS was diagnosed by seeing 3 MS or myelin destructing type lesions on MRI, I had a positive lumbar puncture for high levels of immunoglobulins in my cerebrospinal fluid and they were not high when tested for them in my blood. I also had nystagmus of my eyes which kind of causes your Eyes to twitch or shake when your doctor examines your eyes as you are looking peripherally. My symptoms during this scary relapse of MS were: slurred speech, temporary paralysis of my right leg, double vision, my handwriting looked a kindergartener's, and my vision would get really blurry, and the morning of my relapse I couldn't even see my Neuropthamologist's number to call her and I never had any vision problems prior to this. I also felt like I was floating up in the air and then move down in a semicircle like pattern. On my way to work driving the roadway would tilt abt 45 degrees to the right. I kept crying for no reason and became depressed. Scary stuff, right? Dr's have to follow certain protocol testing for diagnosing MS and other CNS conditions. They do this because alot of overlap happens with CNS conditions and all conditions are treated differently. I looked at arachnoid cyst images on google and they look exactly like yours. On a flair T2 type MRI with contrast, the contrast lights up the cerebral spinal fluid as white, and that fills up the cyst on your MRI, which probably blocks visualization of the brain structures below it. It also said the cysts lie on the outside or on top of the brain. As more CSF builds up in the cyst it starts to put pressure on the brain, which is causing\nyour symptoms, just like hydrocephalus in other people. They probably are doing a follow up MRI to see if any additional fluid build up is seen in the cyst and then decide to treat it medically or surgically. The Neuro-opthamologist will know a lot about this, bring her all of your MRI SCANS and your VEP studies, this will save you a lot of time if she doesn't have copies, trust me usually they don't. Write down all of your questions for the doctors ahead of time and bring them with you too, leave space to fill in the answers so you don't forget. I will try to post one of my MRI scans to show you what MS lesions look like.

The only times I got up were to throw up and use the washroom and my body kept leaning into the wall while negotiating the hallway. I brought it up with my doctor at my sons 6-week checkup and by then my symptoms seemed to have passed. The words \"multiple sclerosis\" was only a suggestion and my life as a new mom went on.

I regained some of the sight after 2-3 months on steroids but experienced many other kinds of relapses over the next decade. I refrained from going on 1 of 4 medications for MS at the time because I didn't fully understand my out of pocket expense correctly. Finally after speaking with an MS Nurse during my appointment with the Neurologist, I began treatment using Copaxone in July 2000. Although I developed ongoing issues with brain fog, bladder hesitency and some muscle weaknesses at times, I have been been relapse free since commencing with Copaxone and continue to give myself the daily injections at this time. I have administered approximately 6000 injections to date and I am filled with gratitude that this drug has given me a relatively normal life in the last 16 1/2 years. The slowed thinking and regular use of catheters is my new normal. Regular time at the gym since 2004 has allowed me to equalize my muscle strength on both sides of my body and a weight of 114 lbs at age 57 keeps me going strong. Copaxone forever :-)\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/4650/march-is-ms-awareness-month"},{"post":{"author":"bethybrightt","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"I just started taking Ampyra and need some advice","post_content":"I'm a MS newbie, diagnosed in December of 2015.

I can walk without assistance (for now) but sometimes my legs just don't feel like legs. I can't walk far, I can't walk straight, I can't walk very fast and sometimes it's hard to walk at all.

I am little scared and could use your thoughts. A little over three weeks ago, my right leg went numb below the knee and I started to get pins and needles in the feet and cramps in the calf. I also had a dull pain behind my left eye and very slight shaking (kind of like my whole body was on vibrate but barely noticeable to me). The pins and needles, numbness and cramps started to migrate to the left feet and calves over the next two days. The afternoon I had a really sharp pain on the right side of my neck of 30 minutes (glosseal neuralgia?) Then it went away. This happened at the same time the following two days for exactly the same time period. I haven't had that since. Then I started to get a little tingling and pins and needles in my hands and twitching in my legs and extreme FATIGUE. It felt like my legs couldn't support me. I also started to get pin pr!ck sensations all over my body but mostly below the waist. Over a few days, the twitching got a little and pin pricks got worse and my right leg and arm felt like it was sunburned, which it wasn't. The sun burn lasted a day . A couple of days later, still having tingling, cramping, twitching, and pin pricks, my right side felt like it was literally on fire. That lasted a day. About a week has past and it felt like my symptoms were very gradually decreasing and them wammmo! Yesterday morning I had severe pain on my left scapula whenever I turn or bend my head left or lift something with my right arm. My buddy did a little acupuncture and the pain went away. I also started getting electric shock sensations on my head all over but mostly on the sides and behind my ears. Today, I had very sharp pains below my calf to my heel that lasted for a second and continued for several hours, intermittently. This is really starting to freak me out. But other than urinary and bowel issues, I pretty much have every ms symptom. Can you get all of these over a 3 week period never having them before? I should point out I am a mid 40s male and in good shape.

We test spinal fluid for inflammation markers called oligoclonal bands.

I'm glad your PCP ordered MRIs as well, as these are helpful in narrowing down the possibilities. Based on your results your PCP will refer you to either a rheumatologist or a neurologist.

Next day, it was back and worse. Took the cambia again but it didn't help, took Advil,daily nortriptiline, muscle relaxers, more cambia. Called my neurologist after 3 days and they suggested going to the ER to get an infusion. It helped, until I stood up to leave. The headache was immediately back. This continued to go on, kept taking everything listed above. Two weeks into this unbearable headache, I saw my neurologist again, he for some reason checked my eyes and saw that my optic nerve in one eye looked larger and told me to call an opthamologist. I of course did and went to the appointment where he told me could not rule out that it was normal, but it also wasn't abnormal. So I called the neurologist with that, he asked me to come in to the office, thinking I had a pseuodotumor cerebri and wanted to do a spinal tap to check the pressure and take a sample. The opening pressure was 12. They then sent me for another infusion to help with the still unbearable headache. This was on a friday.This is now week three of this crippling headache. Fast forward to Monday, still unable to stand from unbearable presssure in my head, so bad I can't breathe, pulse racing. Call the doctor, they think it's an anuerism, rush to the ER. They run NO tests and speak with my neurologist who says it's from the spinal tap and says to give me an infusion and rest for 48 hours. Rest 48 hours, it's Wednesday and I've now missed 4 days of work and we're heading into week 4 of this headache.

Software is chromosomes which carry proteins which make the brain function properly.\nChromosomes with deletions, mutations, additions, displacements, - hard drive is bad. Proteins such as Lingo-1 which are only malfunctioning, - software problem.\nWhen we have a problem with malfunctioning programs on a laptop, we run diagnostics, re-program, then reboot the system. Problem solved. If we have a way to communicate with a problematic protein such as Lingo-1, we can do the same thing. Lingo-1 negative regulatory protein is Leucine rich, which gives us our mode of communication. Being the only essential amino acid which the human body cannot synthesize and must be imported through diet, - we basically - by controlling Leucine intake through mathematically calculated dosages and time frames, as well as using BIIB033 as a useful tool, are telling Lingo-1 how to function properly. Once the re-programming is completed we simply reboot the brain. -Sleeping and eating a normal diet again.\nThe Lingo-1 clinical trials showed nothing promising because there was no communication whatsoever. Simply disabling it once a month with a monoclonal antibody tells it nothing. Once Lingo-1 recovers from being disabled, it is now enabled to go back to acting the way it was before - improperly.\nI hope this correlation helps Stephanie understand. If so, maybe it will help her, and the medical professionals as well, to think outside the box.\nIf medical science moved as fast as technology we would by now have every human disease state solved.\nThe end.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"Expert - Stephanie Butler, RN","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Response from Stephanie Butler per reply to her post ??","resp_content":"As a clinician and someone with MS who is involved in research this is a topic that I do understand, and find very interesting.

If not then don't start, but if you already do you may want to get serious about quitting. Here is what you need to know about smoking's impact on MS:\n\n- Smoking has been linked to an increased risk for developing MS\n- Smoking may increase the odds of progressing from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS\n-Smoking has been linked to faster MS progression and more disability\n\nAdditionally smoking increases your risk for heart and lung disease, which can also worsen your MS symptoms. However, on a positive note, the benefits of quitting can be seen in a matter of minutes....YES really! Here's a timeline of what you can expect once you kick the habit:\n\n20 minutes– Your heart rate returns to normal.\n\n2 hours– Your blood pressure and circulation normalize, but unfortunately withdrawal begins.\n\n12 hours– Carbon monoxide levels in your blood return to normal.\n\n24 hours– Your risk of having a heart attack already decreases!\n\n48 hours– Your sense of smell and taste become heightened (nicotine dulls your senses).\n\n3 days– All nicotine is out of your body, unless you are weaning with help from nicotine gum or a patch.\n\n3 weeks– Because of the improvements in circulation and lung function you will be able to tolerate exercise better. Withdrawal symptoms will also significantly improve.\n\n9 months– Your lungs begin to repair themselves resulting in less coughing and shortness of breath, as well as a decreased risk for infections.\n\n1 year– You are officially considered a non-smoker! Your risk for heart disease is also reduced by an incredible 50%.\n\n5 years– Your risk for stroke is significantly reduced.\n\n10 years– You reduce your risk for lung cancer by 50%. You also have a reduced risk for mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer.\n\n15 years– You officially have the same risk for heart disease and stroke as a non-smoker, that is a huge accomplishment!\n\nGood luck!

It's a common issue, and there are several strategies to improve both speech and swallowing difficulties.\n\nSpeech\n\nMS can cause a couple different vocal issues. Dysarthria is slow, slurred, or quiet speech that is a result of poor or limited articulation. Dysphonia causes your voice change making it sound harsh, hoarse, overly nasal, or breathy. Most people take the ability to talk for granted, which can make it seem like a fairly straightforward task. However, speaking requires 100 different chest, neck, jaw, and facial muscles to work in synch. If the nerves to any of these muscle groups, or the movement of the vocal cords are affected by MS you may not be able to speak as eloquently as you once could. In most cases an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) is recommended, and can be extremely helpful. They can take a careful look at how all those muscles are moving and your breath control. Then, just like a physical therapist, they can suggest exercises to strengthen the muscles that control speech.\n\nSwallowing\n\nThe same muscles that you use when you speak are also responsible for swallowing. Difficulty with initiating a swallow, choking, coughing while eating or drinking, or frequently clearing your throat during meals can be warning signs of a swallowing disorder (dysphagia). This is a potentially life-threatening issue because it can lead to choking, or even aspiration pneumonia. If you think you are experiencing dysphagia you should bring it to the attention of your neurologist immediately, and once again they will probably recommend an evaluation by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP).\nYour therapist can do a couple of diagnostic tests to pinpoint your issue, and come up with a personalized treatment plan. There are several strategies for managing dysphagia such as slightly tucking your chin, alternating a bites of food with sips of liquid, and swallowing each bite twice can greatly reduce the risk of choking. Therapists can also recommend the right amount and consistency for food and liquids for you. It is also important to always eat and drink while sitting straight up, keep your tongue and teeth as clean as possible to reduce the bacteria in your mouth, and to take a break if you feel fatigued at mealtime.","like_count":"1","tags":["Living & Managing","Symptoms"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/806/how-to-recognize-and-manage-speech-and-swallow-symptoms"},{"post":{"author":"carlasp","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"I have a Knot on my foot and it is painful","post_content":"I was DX in 2005 with MS.

There are so many ways that MS can impact sex and intimacy, but the good news is most issues can be compensated for. I'll briefly touch on a couple of the more common issues, and provide you with links to a lot more great information...\n\nCommunication: MS can be stressful and overwhelming to both parties. Often times roles shift, and one person must get used to taking on more responsibility while the other has to get used to letting go of some of the control they once had. MS can also cause financial strain between the cost of care and lost income. It takes more work to stay connected as a couple, both physically and emotionally when the stress and strain of everyday life piles up. If you and your husband aren't communicating well, speak to someone and learn to listen to one another again. This can be another couple who has gone through something similar, a counselor, your neurologist, your pastor- whatever is most comfortable for you!\n\nSexual Dysfunction: There are a few reasons for sexual dysfunction in MS. Sometimes it is a direct result of MS, due to numbness, difficulty with arousal and/or orgasm, bowel and bladder dysfunction, pain, fatigue, heat intolerance, weakness, or a combination of symptoms. All of these symptoms can improve with treatment. A lot of medications used to treat MS symptoms can also cause sexual dysfunction. If sex is painful then it could also be related to MS, or even menopause. Your doctor SHOULD be asking you if you are having any problems, but often times it is not addressed during routine follow-ups. Speak up and let your doctor know what's going on. If they don't know how to help, then ask him/her who you could speak with that does!\n\nYou are NOT alone in this. Sex and intimacy are huge issues for many of us living with MS. It's OK to talk about it, and I hope some of this information helps!\n\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Family-and-Relationships/Intimacy#section-5\n\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Sexual-Dysfunction\n\nhttp://www.nationalmssociety.org/NationalMSSociety/media/MSNationalFiles/Research/Research%20Calls/Intimacy-Presentation.pdf\n\nAll the best,\nStephanie\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/multiple-sclerosis/627/sex-and-ms"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Deep brain stimulation","post_content":"My doctor is suggesting deep brain stimulation.

In April I got up one morning and instead of getting up like normal my body veered to the right, I then went on to experience vertigo like symptoms for some time. It got better for a few weeks and then came back. I couldn't walk strait to save my life. LOL especially first thing in the morning. My PCP sent me to ENT, then a cardiologist, and now to the Neurologist. I had my apt on Monday. *side note, I have had other symptoms as well such as weakness in arms and legs and numbness in hands and left leg. I have had tingling and a tremor (which I have had once in the past only on the other hand) my legs feel like Jello and the muscles feel so tired.*\n\nOK my question is. Is it typical for a neurologist after completing the exam to not say one way or another how I did? what was normal, what was not?? Because this doctor didn't say a word. This is bugging me now. I mean because I know some of the things weren't normal. But he didn't elaborate or explain. Like for example my reflexes. I am not sure how all the others were, but when it came to my left leg it was VERY hyper reflexive....It scared me HA! he bopped my knee and my knee shot up like a high kick! That \"can't\" be normal ... right? Also I could not walk on my heels at all. Those were the only two things that I know of. I don't understand the results of anything else.\n\nHe did order an MRI and a EMG so maybe that should tell me something. But he did say that the balance problems and dizziness was just vertigo, which confused me. *sigh*\n\nUGH! I am so frustrated!!!\n\nA: I know from firsthand experience that searching for a diagnosis is extremely frustrating, so I'm sorry you have to go through this! In all likelihood he didn't explain what was abnormal because in neurology it is very difficult to say before seeing test results. We use the neuro exam as an initial screening, and if something seems abnormal it helps us decide what tests to order so that we can get to the bottom of things. I'm hoping you will get some answers after you have your MRI and EMG done, hang in there!

I know that alcohol is not too good for my health either, so I was wondering, can I drink alcohol if I have MS?\n\nA: In general having MS doesn't necessarily mean you can't drink alcohol. However, it is very important to talk to your doctor if you are unsure! Alcohol can interact with a number of medications that we take for symptom management, like muscle relaxers, steroids, and pain medication. It can also make some of your symptoms worse because it acts on the central nervous system, so if you have difficulties with speech or balance you may notice that they are worse after drinking. The key is moderation, and because MS affects all of us differently you should focus on doing what's best for you!","like_count":"1","tags":["Living & Managing"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: MS and Alcohol","resp_content":"Hi Stephanie!\n\nI saw that question as well.
