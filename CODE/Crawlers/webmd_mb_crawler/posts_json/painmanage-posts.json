I had an upper endoscopy and the doctor saw I had errosive esophasgitis near my esophageal sphincter. I used to burp about once every ten seconds and would feel sharp pain in the center of my chest if I wasn't able to burp and built up too much gas. I'd average about 3 hours of sleep per night, scared of going to bed every night cause I knew I was just going to leap out of bed yelling feeling like someone stabbed a sword through my chest.\nFinally a few days ago I tried eating only soft foods, I know very simple but it is really helping a lot. Been getting a full nights rest for the first time in years. Id say I'm about 75% cured. So that's all I did. Anything remotely course will flare it up, ie. Popcorn, nuts, chips, bread, meats etc. Examples of things that are okay for me: Yogurt, ramen noodles (thoroughly cooked), soft beans (chewed up well so they are like a paste), peanut butter etc. If you have gerd please give this, it's been saving me from a world of pain.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/113899/biggest-help-for-gerd-and-errosive-esophasgitis-i-ve-found"},{"post":{"author":"mommybear112200","post_time":"3 days ago","post_title":"Constant foot pain","post_content":"I have some numbness, pins and needles and some tingling sensation in both of my legs and feet.

After quite a bit of medical confusion, an orthopedic surgeon, and friend of my father, pinpointed the source of my pain and muscle spasms. He put me on a protocol of Soma Compound, heat, and physical stretching and activity for 7 to 14 days.\nOver the subsequent 26 years, until his retirement, I received the same therapy every time I did something stupid and aggravated my back. Those aggravations became farther apart.\n\nI have had a primary physician for the past 22 years, who has been tasked twice to care for my back. He insisted on a short course of Prednisolone and stretching exercises for the first occurrence, which required more than 4 months to clear up, rather than the 1 to 2 weeks which I had become accustomed to. It is now 7 years later and he is insisting on the same treatment as the first time plus some physical therapy which proved useless. I took it upon my self to seek treatment at a local orthopedic clinic, had X-rays, the same descriptions as I got in 1974, a couple of cortisone injections, a short course of Prednisolone, advice to call back in 3 weeks if not better; and an MRI when it wasn't. After the MRI, the doctor wanted to send me to a pain management program.\n\nI can't figure out why these doctors keep 'tap-dancing' around a treatment which worked remarkably well 46 years ago, and from which I suffered no side effects, and am certainly not addicted to any substance.

After about 10 days it was feeling decent enough to try doing about 5 extremely mild assisted push ups on the wall, and 5 very mild rows on TRX straps (standing up), and then the random sharp pains become worse and more frequent over the next couple days.

I don't really know what's going on.. even the little I'm telling you I can't tell you I'm saying everything 100 percent correct. I'm not told much because he's my boyfriend of a little less than a year who has a son with a woman who is very obsessed with him and doesn't want to let go of the relationship and who he's kept our relationship mostly private from. As you can imagine she's aware of a lot now and doesn't like that I come see him even though I'm the one who sleeps with him every night and took care of him and loved him! I know how selfish I sound but I can't take how selfish someone can be in a situation this devastating. I'm honestly avoiding any conversation with her because I know he wouldn't like for me to tell her anything.. and his family told me not to as well. My boyfriends family (mother and sister) are quite aware of how she is though they don't want to lose the ability to see their nephew and grandson, understandably. So I was told that his sons mother is talking about taking me off of the hospital visiting list, because she's upset at the relationship we had. So I guess my question is.. is that possible? If they were never married? And we already have to go to the precinct to get paperwork every single day that we want to see him that states in his sister, because he was arrested because of problems that occurred during the accident. So that makes it incredibly difficult to see him besides having my own child that I have no help caring for. I can only really see him during school hours and it's never enough time and I just keep trying to understand how people function daily when a loved one is in this condition going through these circumstances and drama. I can barely function I just want to be with him and do right by him cause I know if he had a say in anything he'd want me to be the one staying with him every night but as of now and probably a long time he won't have a say in much, I honestly don't know whether I'm right or wrong .. if I should be visiting every day or calm down and visit every other day maybe? last I heard they were going to try and wake him up 72 hours after the surgery but he woke up himself a little before then and they said that he was basically in stable condition. He has a breathing tube and he's very sedated. I'd like to believe he hears me and knows I'm there. Whenever I'm there visiting since he's “woken” his eyes are still dazed but I feel as if they move to where I'm speaking. when I talk to him and tell him I'm leaving he occasionally lifts his arm or starts jumping a little, it's scary but it's usually right when I'm telling him I'll see him later and leave him, and then when I tell him to calm down he does. Does anyone have any advice anything positive that they know about injuries like this and also realistic expectations to what I'll be dealing with in the next few months to a year. Is there even a possibility with the little info I gave you to tell me whether or not there's a chance I'll speak to him again where he'll understand or be able to communicate back?

I have gone through various treatments and seen a handful of doctors in which not one of them have successfully diagnosed or treated my injury and the pain to which it causes. For those who are interested I will break this post down by the accident, my symptoms, my treatment, testing performed, diagnoses and where I am today.\n\nThe Accident: I was rear ended while stopped at a traffic light by a much larger SUV that was traveling at a high rate of speed. The impact was not straight on, front to back, rather it was their passenger front corner to my driver's rear corner. At the moment of impact my left arm was on the top of my steering wheel and my head was turned to the left looking at oncoming traffic. Due to the angle of the vehicles and my body position in the car, I whip-lashed sideways. My body went to the right and then to the left causing my head to strike my driver's side door window which resulted in a laceration to my left eyebrow. I was wearing a seat belt which \"deployed\" and I was pinned into my seat; it took both hands and all of my strength to unbuckle after the accident.\n\nMy Symptoms: Middle back pain, to the left of my spine around t10 vertebrae. I have a constant pain of 1-2 on the left side of my back.\nThis pain can be increased if I twist to the left. The most severe of my pain comes if I hold my left arm straight out and rotate it to the left while twisting my torso. I also experience random and intermittent \"clicking\" in my back to the left of my spine in the area of pain. I had no history of middle back pain or the clicking prior to the accident.\n\nMy Treatment: The day of the accident my left eyebrow was sutured and no other treatment was provided by the urgent care. I was experiencing back pain immediately following the accident but anticipated it due to the force of the impact. Two weeks after the accident my back pain had not subsided, so my Primary Care Physician prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxers which after 10 days of taking them religiously did not help. I was then referred to a Neurosurgeon who prescribed Physical Therapy. I went through 12 sessions of PT which included warm-up exercises, thoracic matrix, heat, stimulation and ultrasound therapy, but in the end the PT only made the pain in my back worse. I was then referred back to the Neurosurgeon who then passed me to a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Doctor (Physiatrist) who then prescribed me additional PT which I opted to take through another clinic. PT this time included exercises, ultrasound therapy using lidocaine cream, stretches and core strengthening. After almost 3 months of PT I had not experienced relief of my pain. The Physiatrist then sent me to Pain Medicine for steroid injections. Over the last 5 months I have had Medial Branch Pain Blocks in my facet joints, Medial Branch Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) in my facet joints and most recently a set of Intercostal Nerve Blocks, all of which are in the same areas of t8 through t10. I have received minor but temporary relief from the injections/ablation, but the pain is still present and at times feels worse than ever before. From months 0-12 I limited my physical activity due to onset of pain with certain movements or extended periods of activity. My level of activity increased slightly after my RFA procedure but I am still not to the level of activity that I was prior to the accident.\n\nTesting Performed: Throughout the course of treatment I have had 3 sets of x-rays, an MRI of my C and T spine and a Bone Scan. The x-rays did not show any abnormalities. The MRI of my C spine was clean but he MRI of my T spine found herniations at T3-T5 although unrelated to my middle back pain which is lower than those levels. The bone scan did not find any rib fractures or bone tumors but did show slight uptake in the left 10th rib/spine articulation. The bone scan was performed 12 months after my accident but somehow still showed some activity where my pain is.\n\nDiagnoses: Early on it was believed that I simply had a muscle strain in my back that wasn't healing. The Physiatrist pointed towards Facet Syndrome since my pain is exacerbated by twisting. One of my Physical Therapists thought that I might have torn a set of muscles in my back that are involved in twisting (serratus posterior inferior). Throughout this entire process I am not entirely sure that any doctor has given me a definitive diagnosis or one that has proved to be correct. Subsequently I have been treated for many things of which no treatment has healed my injury or stopped the pain.\n\nWhere I Am Today: After 16 months of pain and ongoing treatments I am still searching for answers. I have a theory as to what my injury is and a lot of \"evidence\" to support it. I believe that I have Slipping Rib Syndrome (SRS). Why? The pain is only on one side of my back; It has never been in the center of my spine, rather to the left of it. The pain is made worse when the rib articulates (twisting to the left). Most recently that pain radiates across my back and around my ribs all the way to the front near my sternum. The \"clicking\" that I am experiencing to the left of my spine only started after my accident. Prior to my RFA procedure the more my back clicked throughout the day, the more pain I would feel. While not significant according to the Nuclear Medicine, the slight uptake of blood shown on my bone scan might be the result of ongoing irritation (inflammation) in the area of my rib/spine articulation that continues to \"click\" throughout the day. The head of the 10th rib has 3 joints, any of which might be causing the clicking and my pain. I have consulted with a Thoracic Surgeon and an Orthopedic Surgeon, but neither of them along with any of the other doctors that I have seen are familiar with SRS let alone have the ability to properly diagnose it. A history of trauma, clicking in my rib/back and unsuccessful Intercostal Nerve Blocks all point to SRS.\n\nI am hoping that someone who reads this post is either familiar with SRS, or has been through a similar situation and successfully treated. I would greatly appreciate any advice or a referral to a doctor who can properly diagnose SRS in or around Michigan.\n\nThank you for reading my post and any support you can provide.","like_count":"1","tags":["Chronic Pain","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"patty2021","resp_time":"4 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Pain, No Diagnosis, Could It Be Slipping Rib Syndrome?","resp_content":"In my experience it is very difficult to find a physician who is able to properly & definitively diagnose spine issues..

Lot of friends and social anxiety issues etc.\n\n2 weeks ago today, he went to bed and next AM complained that he had really bad headaches overnight around 12:30-1am and kept him up for 3-4 hours.\n\nDidn't think much of it, sounded like the flu and it is flu season here in the North East. Stayed home from school. Also had sniffles, no fever, little weak in the legs, etc.\n\nNext AM, said the same thing. So since Flu season is here, figured another day of rest, no big deal.\n\nHe felt good during the day however with zero headaches other than feeling \"tired\" type of thing.\n\nSo this went on for 2 more days. Took him to the doctor, they did full exam looking for sinus issues, etc. Did blood test for mono and flu. Came back negative. Told me to give him Sudafed and tylenol for the headaches.\n\nHappened 2 more nights in a row.\n\nMy wife and I started to get a little nervous. He missed 5 days of school from the same thing.\n\nSo he will go to sleep around 10:30-11pm and wake up around 12-1am with this really intense headache that actually wakes him up from sleep. It keeps him awake for 3-4 hours so by the time it fades away, it's 4:30-5am and he has school at 7am and he's exhausted from the \"battle\" of it.\n\nDoctor said to get to hospital and have them do a CT scan. Took him there, they did a CT scan and 5 different blood tests. All came back negative and they said the CT scan was clean.\n\nDoctor then suggested that right before bed, take 2 advil and 4 tylenol at the same time to try and knock it out. I also put a humidifier in the room as well since the air was a little dry.\n\nNothing worked. At all. Same nights, same results and almost all at the same time frames.\n\nDuring the day he is fine. He has gone out with friends in the afternoon, has his GF over, no issues at all. It just starts at night right after he falls asleep. He is only able to stay asleep for 45 min or so before it starts.\n\nWent back to his doctor. BTW - They tested for Lyme as well and that came back negative. His doctor said that because of the acute nature of this, starting out of nowhere and there being no history of head injury or anything else, she thinks it's an infection of some kind most like Sinus.\n\nAgain, he is a little stuffy but nothing over the top. So she gave us antibiotic 2 nights ago and still there's been no change.\n\nWe have a neurologists appt in 10 days but I don't know if he can keep this up for that long.\n\nAnyone else ever have these same symptoms and found either relief or a diagnoses of some kind?\n\nHe's a junior in HS and missing a lot of days.

My hand feels numb and it hurts to use my arm. I went to the doctor about a week after the pain started. She thought I had strained my shoulder and organised some physio for me and some pain relief. My doctor said she could give me some time off work but I felt I was still able to work as I am right-handed and I can hold my left arm in front of me. She advised against the use of a sling as its best to keep using your arm to keep it moving. I was able to work for the first couple of weeks but then the pain became unbearable and I was unable to move my arm from resting in front of me. I had to get my Mum to take me to the doctor because i could not drive. They gave me a cortisone injection to relieve the pain and 5 days off work. The injection did not relieve my pain at all but it did give me some more movement back to how it was before the injection. During this time I have had difficulty doing everyday tasks. I can't do dishs, any kind of housework, wash my hair (I have very long hair), tie my hair up, hang washing out, put on a bra (even in the front and turn it around) or undo my bra. I have had my partner who lives with me to help with my bra and other household tasks. After the 5 days were up I couldnt go back to work I could barely move my arm again. I work as a support worker for an aged care community organisation caring for the elderly doing personal care and house work. There are no light duties involved in my work and I very much need my left arm to do my job. I went back to my doctor and she put me off for 3 weeks, gave me a codeine prescription and referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon at Grace Hospital. I rang to make an appointment and I was told they send it in the mail. I have had an ultrasound on my shoulder that came back clear. I have had an x-ray on my neck and shoulder that also came back clear. I have had blood tests to rule out infection and they have also came back clear. Yet the pain is still there. I have had physio but I don't think that is helping due to the cause being unknown. I have good days and bad days. Yesterday was an extremely bad day. I woke up barely being able to move my arm. I rang my doctor that morning as it was very painful and I didn't know when I would get the letter from Grace Hospital. She told me to go to the Tauranga Hospital immediately as she was concerned that it wasn't improving and it had been going on too long. She had rung ahead to the orthopaedics department so they knew I was coming. Thankfully when I got there I didn't have to wait long. I was seen by the orthopaedic registrar. He ordered more blood tests and an x-ray. He moved my arm around to test how the shoulder was. It appeared to be working normally and he couldnt work out where my pain was coming from. Although he did think it was possibly a pinched nerve which i thought it could be from Dr Google. Both tests came back clear. I was then seen by the orthopaedic consultant. He also moved my arm around to test the shoulder. He said he could not work out where my pain was coming from either. He is going to send me off for a M.R.I in a couple of weeks. He thinks I did not need to be in hospital and off he went. I was in so much pain and felt distressed after he left. I felt like I was no closer to finding out what was causing my pain. Now im just waiting for my M.R.I. I can't understand why they couldn't give it to me while I was there. I understand its a public system but i just dont think he took my pain seriously as he also said it would probably just go away on its own. In the mean time my relationship is under immense pressure. I suffer from Bipolar Disorder and am at risk of having a relapse. Being away from work for so long about 10 days so far is no good for my mental health. I dont have a reason to get up in the morning and I don't have contact with my clients. I feel very isolated and lonely.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Neck Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Unexplained Shoulder Pain","resp_content":"TALK TO YOUR THERAPIST YOUR PAIN IS MOSTLY LIKELY MENTAL IN NATURE\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"3 months ago","resp_title":"You’re an idiot!

Pain initially was only in thighs and calves. Seems to more be focused around the knees at the moment. No weakness really, and no numbness. Almost burning feeling sometimes. They have felt kind of jelly like a couple times after exercise but not a usual thing. Some spasms... Usually okay if not walking or standing for an extended period of time, but will start to ache when doing so. Hot baths seem to help best. I also have this consistent need to want to stretch.\nPain initially started the same day that I had a stomach bug. Not sure if it is a coincidence. I didn't really have a fever and the bug only lasted a day... Had a little arm soreness initially and have felt that as well recently. Could be anxiety...\nThe only connection I have found was experiencing some rhabdo (high CK levels) 2 years ago after a very vigorous exercise session. I peed brown and went to the doctor. Took Advil and Tylenol. Pain was experienced in same parts of legs (thighs, calves) and I could hardly walk for a week. Very very painful. After that, I appeared to be fine (up until now).\nIt seems extremely coincidental that a year after the injury the same places in the leg feel sore. But it's just not going away! But the doctors don't seem to think there is a connection? I don't know...\nGot EMG and long list of blood tests. Have seen 2 specialists (rhum and neur musc)... All results were normal.\n\nNext step would be a biopsy. I'm a little hesitant but the pains lasted awhile now. Maybe try a sports doc?

Genetically modified foods, pollutions, toxins, etc., have affected the ability of our body to function in the way it was naturally intended. The inventions of radio, cellular communication and other such devices that transmit electromagnetic waves have also caused a new kind of stress to the body known as electromagnetic pollution. The way in which we deal with pain, injuries, ailments, and stressors to the body has advanced immensely in the past few centuries. The medical field has been a blossoming industry that deals primarily with correcting these problems. In modern times, it appears that the cure to these problems is in the form of some sort of chemical that is ingested into the body.\n\nFor example, when a part of the body is injured, our natural protective mechanisms go to work. White blood cell count at the site of the injury increases, which causes heat, loss of function, and pain. All of these effects are potentially beneficial; but after we know we are injured, the pain is not a good thing. Taking ibuprofen acts as a painkiller due to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. It does this by interfering with the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, which will in effect help alleviate the pain and solve one problem, but may also create others. As well as being harmful to your liver, ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, constipation, gas, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nAlternative solutions to these problems – such as Eastern medicine – take a different approach to this. While the Western medicine approach clearly separates health and disease, the Eastern medicine approach considers health as a balanced state, versus disease as an unbalanced state.\n\nEastern Chinese medicine divides the body into parts by their function rather than their structure: the anatomical, physiological, and psychological. These parts are all connected by what they call “meridians” which are electrical pathways that carry energy and information throughout the body.\n\nWhen the flow of energy and information throughout these pathways is blocked or slowed down, our body enters a state of disease, which ultimately leads to illness and sickness. Electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic waves/fields, and acoustic waves can all be used to send messages to the body and its energetic field. Different forms of electromagnetic waves/fields and frequencies can influence the human body.","like_count":"0","tags":["Knee Pain","Headaches","Neck Pain","Physical Therapy","Hip Pain","Migraines","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"graeme66","resp_time":"4 months ago","resp_title":"RE: What can interact with the body’s energy field?","resp_content":"Indeed, magnetic fields play a HUGE role in the body's energy levels.

Before that block a physician blocked from the neck down ( I was a nurse for this hospital ) one of the nurses that was helping with the block told the Dr. he was blocking me to high and he told her I am the Doctor and his block numbed me from my shoulders to my toes! That was the beginning of my life with RSD or COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME! After I had my Sympathectomies I went into remission! It came back when I pulled my shoulder out of socket! I pulled out our medical bag from my SUV and it pulled me backwards, hence RSD again since 2000!

Did you pay cash for a private Dr, find a pain solution, demand a diagnosis, or did you lose your job and are stuck on the couch in agony? If you dont want to read all this, skip to last paragraph for your input, please.\nI find it ironic, they can mask your pain for years and then suddenly stop your pain meds without even trying to determine the cause. Trust me, most of your diagnosis are inaccurate anyway. They dont get paid without labeling you with a diagnosis so they make up anything. My dr puts failed back surgery even tho my surgery was fine. It's also the reason they slap fibromyalgia on your chart. No costly tests to prove it. They can stop trying to figure out what you really have wrong.\nMy new pm gave me this excuse to begin the weining process. . \"Theres been studies \"some\" peoples pain \"may\" increase with long term use\".\nHe never mentioned hyperalgesia to me or listed in records.\nHeres a hilarous response I got today from dr. I asked him, you said i need to lower dose (really means stop) because pills are increasing pain. I've lowered dose by 80mg now and feel worse. After his lying excuse I said, that cant be true because I used to take double this dose before coming to kp and I felt half way normal with a semi normal quality of life. I've been on lower dose over 5 yrs, why didnt I feel better then per your statement? He responds, \"that's because you were on such a high dose, you just peed out the excess\", . I rolled my eyes and said well how come you dont pee out excess meds they give you after surgery, , they still work for post op pain ? He says, \"ah ah that's because you have more pain receptors after surgery. \"\nThe bottom line is kp is all about numbers, goals, and raises . They are given a bonus or more, to meet certain \"numbers\". (Goals). Their current goal is to have 80% of members use online pharmacy. Hummm, so if you cant fill scheduled drugs online, you will mess up their goal and they wont meet quota. There even using same goal for employees to recieve small yearly bonus. Goal not met, no bonus.\nIf this is any indication of how much this plays into your care, the CEO makes 16 million dollars a year! Employees are getting ready to strike, and his pay is advertised everywhere.\n\nIf you sought care outside of kp, please list any chalanges you faced like no referal, incomplete records, inaccurate records, no trust. .\nDid anybody find it difficult to pay cash for expensive required urine tests, they cost around $500?

I've had 3 back surgeries now on L4,L5 to correct the problem. I'm in far more pain than I was before the surgeries. The quality of my life has decreased significantly. Before it was discovered that I could not carry through with the my job duties, I resigned from my job recently. I have never quit healed from the day of the accident. I was referred to a pain management dr. However, I do not trust my pain mgmt dr. Although he is prescribing pain pills to me at this time, I feel like he is pushing the Spinal Cord Simulator on me. I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before he stops prescribing medicine to me because I keep saying no to the spinal cord simulator. I'm living a nightmare. My diagnosis is \"failed back surgery.\" I take Gabapentin 600 mg 3x a day with Zohydro twice a day. That's barely enough to calm my nerves through my legs and ease the pain in my back.

I have been on them far too long...I believe since June 2016? Since my 1st back surgery. I'd describe my quality of life as \"draining and exhausting.\" Sounds like yours too. The surgeon who did my 3 back surgeries dumped me off on pain management. However, I checked in another orthopedic for a second opinion last summer who said no more surgeries, no more anything just rest. While with pain management, get care, have time to heal, and get some shots to see if, in fact, this last surgery takes. After 14 months, I checked back in with the orthopedic this past Friday (9/7/18.) Sadly enough, he says according to the x-rays, I haven't healed. Unfortunately, my surgery has slipped from where it was placed. It could be a matter of bone density or just plain bad work. But, it shows, I have a lot of nerves compressed. I have a CT myelogram scheduled for 9/20/18. It's where they inject dye into my back. Once it's had 2 hours to settle, they'll look for blockage through my body. They're suggesting reconstructive back fusion. I'm mixed about the news. On one foot, I'm relieved to hear there's light at the end of the tunnel. I have been in so much pain for too long, I'm ready to get my live back. On the other foot; however, I'm reluctant to have anyone else touch me. I mean, I selected my dr, because he was a \"Dr\" close by my work and had good reviews. Even though word of mouth, I heard good things. I thought, I'd be repaired within a summer (teacher) and keep going. I wasn't suppose to be hurting 3 years later trying to hide it from everyone including my job. It's been hell!

There are several reasons for this. First, continued use build up a tolerance to the drug so the dosage must be increased to obtain the same level of relief. This is different from addiction. Next, long term use of opioids generally makes most people more sensitive to pain with the result being that lower levels of pain start to hurt more. Opioids also replace the bodies natural pain killers so that the body either slow downs or stops making them. The effect of this is also to generally increase pain levels. As with all medications, individuals react differently to the same medication so while the above refers to the majority of people there are exceptions.\nReply\nrosie425\n11 months ago\nI have the same problem.

It also seems to be one of the least understood neurological illnesses that occur. It may be one of the most misunderstood neurological illnesses as well. Many of the treatments for migraines seem to have been based on trial and error of treating the symptoms rather than serious scientific research as to the root causes of migraines of which there may be several. Symptoms do include physiological changes such as blood vessel changes, blood pressure changes, visual effects, muscle reactions, and other neurological changes. Given this information, it is not particular surprising that the number of treatments and medications available seem to be endless.\n\nWhile migraines are often classified by belonging to certain groups or subtypes, which often respond to a class of particular treatments, the resolution of what works for an individual often tends to be unique for that person. What works for one may work for others, or not. Treatments that worked previously for an individual may gradually or suddenly stop working for no specific reason.\n\nThat is why most migraine sufferers find themselves having to add a second occupation to their skill set - that of being a medical detective - sort of a Sherlock Holmes for migraines. This requires one to be their own advocate in search for the treatment that will be effective in mitigating their migraines. This requires both patience and time and is often fraught with seeming endless failures.\n\nTo be successful there are a few basic principles that I believe should be adhered to:\n\n- In regard to any treatment or medication that involves doing something or taking something you would not normally do or take, ALWAYS discuss it with a licensed health professional who has a background of migraine experience before trying it. Depending on your overall health, what might be safe for someone else, may not be safe for you.\n\n- NEVER give up trying, as the effective treatment just might be the next one you try. Treatments are always being invented and changing. Sometimes a group of several treatments or medications, or a combination of both may result in success.\n\n- Do the research and become an informed patient before trying any medication or treatment. Know the potential side effects and fully understand the risks of any treatment, as well ask what it might cost and what other things the treatment or medication might conflict with.\n\n- Give the treatment time to work. This is very important as some treatments or medications take weeks to months to become effective. Conversely if a treatment stops working for a significant period of time, it becomes pointless to continue to use it without any changes or investigating alternatives.\n\n- Religiously follow the directions of the treatment or medication. It is unlikely to work if you don't use it as it is supposed to be used.\n\n- A little skepticism is good. But completely rejecting a treatment simply because it sounds weird or just seems to simple or non-standard can be to your detriment. It may be worth trying PROVIDING it can do no harm. Often a little research or getting a second opinion with allow you to make an informed decision.\n\nI was very skeptical when it was suggested I try mindfulness exercises by a licensed health professional experienced in pain management. But since it could do no harm I tried it anyway, while trying not to prejudge. To my surprise and relief, it has worked to a point that it has become a useful tool, among others, for mitigating my chronic migraines.\n\nCurrently there is no single medication or treatment available that will work for all migraine patients, that I am aware of - i.e. miracle drug or treatment, that will work for all who suffer from this maliady. If someone promises you that they have a treatment or medication that will absolutely cure you of migraines, without giving you a proper exam and knowing your previous migraine history, they are most likely giving you false hope, and are are more interested in your wallet than your migraine. Historically this was once labeled 'Snake Oil'.\n\nAs you read through this discussion board, you will come across many treatments and medications that have worked for others. That does not mean they will work for you. One the other hand, after a discussion with a licensed health profession, if you feel like trying one of them, and research indicates it poses minimal risk to your overall health, lifestyle and wallet, the worst that can likely happen is that it won't work or it might temporarily increase your migraines while using it. If it does, you only need to stop it to get back where you where before.\n\nThat said you should never suddenly stop a treatment or medication without first discussing it with a licensed health professional, in particular with certain medications, as some of them if suddenly stopped can result in serious psychological, or physical side effects.\n\nFinally you need to believe - and keep on believing, that somewhere out there, their is a course of treatment that ultimately will mitigate the impact of migraines on your everyday life. All YOU have to do is find it. While not an easy task, it is doable, as so many others have sucessfully found out.\n\nThe above content is based on my own experience of having to deal with migraines all my life and should not be considered to be professional medical advice.\n"},{"author":"healthegut","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Migraine","resp_content":"This may sound crazy but Migraines can be linked to leaky gut syndrome.

My fiancé has been dealing with back pain similar to what you describe and it has been going on for quite some time. She has tried NSAIDs, muscle relaxers, massage, Epsom salt, yoga, etc, to no avail. Seeing your primary care physician is a good start to rule out other possible causes, but a physical therapist specializes in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. In most states, you can schedule a visit with a physical therapist without seeing your medical doctor first. If you are desperate, and your physician is not immediately available, I would recommend contacting a physical therapist for an examination and possibly treatment.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, physical therapists specialize in the treatment of the musculoskeletal system. This means that they examine, evaluate, and treat issues dealing with muscles, joints, posture, and movement patterns. Physical therapists often encounter patient who are dealing with neck or back pain and much research has been done showing the effectiveness of physical therapy in treating these conditions. Physical therapists not only utilize stretching and strengthening exercises but massage, mobilization/manipulation, ultrasound, dry needling, and many more techniques to treat specific conditions.\n\nUnfortunately, when individuals are faced with acute or chronic pain, the prescription of pain relieving drugs is often the first line of treatment. While effective, these drugs treat the symptoms, not the cause. Physical therapy has been shown, in most cases, to be effective in treating both the symptoms and the causes of pain. In fact, several studies have shown physical therapy to be more effective in terms of long-term pain relief when compared to drugs such as NSAIDs and opioids.1\n\nExercise is important, not only from a functional perspective, but from a health perspective. Physical therapists work with patients and develop exercises programs to correct muscle weakness and muscle imbalances. Often tight or weak muscles are the cause of back and neck pain. Other factors such as posture, obesity, and inactivity can contribute to your musculoskeletal health. A study tracking the lifestyle of 20,000 individuals over an 11 year period revealed that people who exercised on a regular basis experienced 23% less chronic pain. Exercise is important, but knowing which exercises to perform and the proper technique is also important. Physical therapists undergo years of training to learn specific exercises that target and strengthen individual muscles as well as muscle groups.\n\nIn addition, physical therapists can treat trigger points (knots) and the formation of scar tissue with manual therapy. While physical therapists implement massage techniques into their practice, there are several skills physical therapists are trained in beyond the scope of a massage therapist. Manual therapy is a treatment approach utilized by physical therapists that manipulates the joints, soft tissue, and connective tissue of a patient. A study examining the effects of manual therapy on individuals with mid and upper back pain showed it to be more effective than stabilizing exercises alone.3 I have a strong belief that you would benefit from manual therapy as you have mentioned massage temporarily providing relief to your symptoms.\n\nBeyond exercises and manual therapy, a physical therapist provides the patient with the education and knowledge to treat their condition at home, on their own time. Depending on the condition, many patients will see a physical therapist for an examination and several treatment sessions. During and after treatment, the physical therapist will prescribe an individualized home exercise program for the patient to follow. This allows the patient to continue therapy without having to meet with the physical therapist. Aside from the home exercise program, physical therapists can educate individuals on proper body mechanics and posture which is crucial for maintaining musculoskeletal health. Body mechanics are particularly important for individuals who frequently bend and lift heavy objects. Research has shown that even a brief exposure to education on body mechanics can have a profound reduction in prevalence of back pain.4 Possibly changing the way you lift objects at work will correct whatever is causing your pain.\n\nI hope this information was helpful, I know not being able to find a solution to pain related issues can be stressful. Stay positive, there is an answer out there. Physical therapy is a good place to start. If you have any questions regarding the information I posted, I would suggest contacting your primary care physician or a licensed physical therapist for feedback. Take care and best of luck! \n\nReferences\n\n1. Mintken PE, Moore JR, Flynn TW. Physical therapists’ role in solving the opioid epidemic. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 2018;48(5):349-353.\n2.

I weaned myself off of 80 mg OxyContin a day approximately 1 1/2 yrs ago. I’ve also read that continuous steroid injections are just as bad. I’ve applied to be in clinical research in hopes of finding other ways to function daily. I am in some type of pain 24/7 and unless you’ve experienced that much pain, nobody will understand.\nI’ve tried to keep up with a couple different meds that are in research trials that are not addictive, no possible chance of overdose and alleviate pain. It’s been 2-3 yrs and still nothing. I’ve tried meditation but it’s extremely hard to quit my mind.\nIf anyone can offer information that might help, I’d appreciate it.\nrené","like_count":"2","tags":["Chronic Pain","Neck Pain","Hip Pain","Medication","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"11 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Pain","resp_content":"Have you tried medical marijuana?\n1\n"},{"author":"psoup38","resp_time":"11 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Pain","resp_content":"I have used CBD oil for my osteoarthritis in my knees and I'm 58.

Current research indicates that long term use of opioids will actually increase chronic pain for most individuals.\n\nAccept the fact that you will likely have pain for the rest of your life but with the proper support, training, and the willingness to try techniques and procedures that are non invasive, performed by licensed health professionals, and have little to no side effects you will likely be able to successfully manage it.\n\nIf you live in the SF Bay Area I would suggest getting a referral to the Stanford Pain Management Clinic. The are one if not the best pain management resources in the Country. They are chronic pain specialists. If not find a pain management clinic that near you, preferably associated with a university that is motivated by helping patients, not profits.\n\nFind & attend a chronic pain support group. Go to www.theacpa.org to find one.\n\nIf anyone promises freedom or a pain free life from your chronic pain, run away from them as fast as you can .

Every 6 to 8 weeks I get muscle relaxer shots in my back which are not addictive. My three suggestions are:\n1) Do you need to lose weight? If so, that needs to be a priority. Weight causes increased pressure on joints and your back which creates more pain. When I lost just 20 lbs I experienced less severe pain. It’s not gone but it is more tolerable.\n2) I stretch every morning. They are simple stretches that I got from my doctor. If my back is hurting during the day I will try to do some stretches. Since I work that can be difficult since we have no place to really go but I’ll sneak into an office and try to get a couple done.\n2) When my back is really painful, I get massages.

This isn't a miracle plant or drug. Our bodies naturally heal themselves and over time this process starts to slow down because of stress, inflammation, and trauma. I want to share this video regarding the opiate crisis.\n"},{"author":"hey_me_too","resp_time":"11 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Pain","resp_content":"Hello rené,\n\nI sympathize with you. I too live in chronic pain and haven't known what normal pain is like since I was 28. I’m now 43. Even before then I dealt with a lot of back and neck pain. I haven’t dealt with automobile accidents as you have. I don’t have any clear answer as to why all of my issues developed other than a wreck on a mini bike that tore up one knee. Other than that, I have arthritis in multiple areas, problems with both knees, nerve damage, scoliosis, avascular necrosis, spondylosis, and the list goes on. I also have to deal with an impaired immune system that lands me sick so often and memory problems that are so incredibly surprising when I discover what it is that I have forgotten. I have all the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis as well as the “bands” of damage to the myelin in my brain, but no formal diagnosis of MS. I understand quite well what you mean about others not understanding what pain is like when you deal with some type of it 24/7.\n\nI don’t understand why you weaned yourself off of pain meds though. And honestly, 80mg of oxycodone per day is not much at all, especially for as much pain as you’ve described. One of the posters on here stated something about a difference between physical dependance and addiction, and they are so very right. For a slightly exaggerated explanation: Addiction is where you’d sell your baby for drugs. Physical dependance is simply your body needing it because you’ve taken it every day for long enough to become dependent. You have to put all of the worry about that out of your mind. The media has done a fine job to insure we all know about this supposed opioid epidemic. I won’t dive into my own personal view on that much, other than saying that the statistics are incredibly skewed that make a convincing story, and I don’t believe it—at least not the way it’s portrayed by the media. You are not a monster, or the bad guy, because you take pain meds and you shouldn’t feel as such. You have to remember that they are not you, and what you stated about people not understanding pain 24/7 applies here just as much. Other people’s opinions shouldn’t affect you dealing with your own pain. A pain doctor I read about put it quite well when talking about treating chronic pain with opiate medications. He stated that for once there’s a positive side effect, amidst the many negative ones often sited with medications, being the positive mood and happy nature caused by opiates for some patients. It may take a while to find a good pain doctor. I’ve seen many and have found some real pieces of garbage along the way. Just because they’re a doctor doesn’t mean they know the answers. I’ve found many that have been wrong.\n\nAmidst the hysteria, remember that pain meds do come from a natural source and they have been used for thousands of years. You are correct, steroid injections can and do cause problems. Usually, now, patients are only given pain meds for chronic pain after they’ve gone through all of the failed intervention pain treatments. Steroid injections caused my avascular necrosis. Surgery can cause a lot of problems as well. I had foot surgery years ago that has now acted up a decade later into pain that wakes me from sleep. I’ve gone through multiple treatments of radio frequency ablation and it has contributed to nerve damage, sleeping problems, and more chronic pain. My pain doctor is now taking about a pain pump and I do not want it. All of this talk about a supposed opioid epidemic has lead to a supposed rule of no more than 100mg of morphine or equivalent per day has now lead to my doctor wanting to implant a pain pump. The CDC has no business doing what they’re doing. This supposed epidemic should not threaten pain doctors and impact the lives of pain patients in negative ways. There is no reason why I should have to consider a pain pump. I am quite capable of taking oral medication and it should not be posed with surgery because of hysteria and pure bs from our government.\n\nIf you’re looking for other ways to deal with pain, I can say that changing your diet can help. Red meat really isn’t good for you. In a natural setting, red meat would only be consumed on a seasonal basis. I made the rule that if I cannot pronounce it, I will not eat it and most things really shouldn’t have much more than 5 ingredients (depending upon what it is, obviously). Cutting out all of the preservatives, additives and chemicals from my diet and my lifestyle in general (including soap, toothpaste, laundry detergent, any anything else I could think of) helped me considerably about 9 years ago. My allergies disappeared, pain was improved along with other aspects of my life. You can read about different herbs online, but I’ve had luck with Turmeric, Ginger Root, Motherwort, and a few others. At one time, I swore by a few different herbs. There are online forums for just about anything you’re going through. I dealt with a divorce 8 years ago and at that time a forum on FaceBook was a Godsend. I’m sure you know that living alone can be quite lonely. Having a pet can provide some company as well as some other structure to life. If considering one, be sure to get one that can fit your lifestyle. For example, a big dog like a German Shepard requires a lot of exercise. If you’re not able to provide such a thing, a large dog as such probably wouldn’t be a good fit.\n\nEveryone is different and you’re going to have to find something that works for you. Ultimately, you’ll have to accept that nothing will ever take away all of your pain. But, that doesn’t mean you should settle either. If you find the right combination of lifestyle changes, friends, food, doctor, medication, and even schedule, many people with severe ailments can lead productive and happy lives. Even “productive and happy” is different for everyone and don’t allow some standard you’ve read about or anyone else’s option to affect your own pursuit for happiness.\n\nAll the best of luck to you,\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/89225/chronic-pain"},{"post":{"author":"amarile","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Back pain","post_content":"I have degenerative disc disease and I bent over and heard and felt a pop in my lower back.

I was cut to less than half of my meds in one month & completely off the next. I have RSD of the right arm and I have been taking medication for about 10 to 12 years. I’ve remained on the same dosage amount for that time because I am young and I knew that there would be a time when I may need a higher dosage. I have never had any dirty urine test or any issues with my doctor but when all of this went down myself among many many others are the ones who have suffered. I immediately started taking any kind of substance that I could to try to treat my out-of-control pain and severe withdrawal symptoms. I had never done any illicit drug before that time and had never even smoked marijuana. Now I am going to a psychiatrist because I became suicidal and kept myself locked in my home for weeks on end without even opening the door or answering my phone. I also am now in a suboxone clinic which is a waste of my time and money because it does not treat the pain. So where do we turn now? If the government would have been honest in their so-called research into the “opioid epidemic” the findings would have shown that the issue this country has is with methamphetamine, heroin and other illegal drugs.

Sure the number of deaths of 'elicit' opioid prescriptions are claim made time and again, but pointing out the connection falls short of any real study as the reader is left to make their own conclusions. More to the crux would have been to show that deaths continue to be on the rise despite the remedial work in arrests and sanctions against companies started years before the studies....an indication that more is afoot then over prescribing and the reluctance to turn the reader toward real issues when heroin and fentanyl are used interchangeably with oxycodone. There are also abstentions from using MS Contin as a medication in these studies as a safer alternative, yet ms contin is vilified with the others as a culprit in the many deaths in the US. A similar vagueness seems to corner the use of these medications (not without their risks, but should have a clean delineation for their lack of use in ending a life by choice or overdose, but more due more to drug abuse). I see a vast disconnect from sending patients from hospitals with a great habit when used in conjunction to reduce pain to manageable levels. I just don't see how the argument is made other then by forcing the issue as in every other sense by use of rehashing information with so little an appeal to reason that, well (I for one cannot see the attachment of a relevant provocation other then begging the reader to forbear the eventuality of common sense appeal, that is not achieved.

Wearable devices not only help people keep track of their health, but also make it a fun experience gaining insight into their daily health and exercise levels (Mesh, J.)”. Wearables in the healthcare industry is bringing a much-needed easy process to monitoring patient health. Employers are even encouraging employees to use this as it can add a health savings.

I am sorry that you are going through this. I understand what you are going through. I have had multiple ankle sprains in the past that have had lasting effects for a long time. I noticed that physical therapy was not listed as one of the methods you have tried to alleviate your ankle pain. I believe that you could benefit from physical therapy.\n\nPhysical therapists are experts of human movement that involves the musculoskeletal and neuromuscular systems. They work with patients to develop exercise programs to correct muscle imbalances, muscle weakness, and reduce pain. Not only do physical therapist use strengthening and stretching exercises, they also utilize massages, manual therapy, ultrasound, and many other methods of treatment.\n\nChronic ankle weakness and instability is something that physical therapists encounter a lot in their clinic. Research has shown that chronic ankle weakness and instability can be effectively treated by physical therapy. The Academy of Orthopedic Physical Therapy has written a guide for physical therapist to treat chronic ankle instability.1 I will post a link to it below, feel free to take a glance at it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, physical therapists use exercise to treat many muscular pain and weakness. Exercise is a key in reducing ankle weakness and instability. One study stated that ankle strengthening exercise programs had significant improvements in functional ability and a reduction of pain, as well as reducing the re-occurrence of pain.2 Physical therapists also use manual therapy, which is the manipulation of joints, soft tissue and connective tissue, in treating ankle weakness and instability. Manual therapy reduces ankle pain and increases ankle range of motion.3\n\nIf you live in a state with direct access, I highly suggest you see a physical therapist. With direct access, you do not need a physician’s referral to see a physical therapist. I will provide you a link below of states with direct access. Once you are at a physical therapy clinic, they will be able to examine and evaluate your ankle. From there, they will implement a treatment plan that is specified for you to have the best possible outcome.\n\nI hope you found this information helpful. I know it can be frustrating but stay positive. If you have any questions, I suggest you contact your primary care physician or a licensed physical therapist. Best of luck!\n\n\nReferences\n1.Martin RL, Davenport TE, Paulseth S, Wukich DK, Godges JJ. Orthopaedic Section American Physical Therapy Association.

It never ended up popping but it started hurting bad as if i had cramped or had a knot in that area. From there on i could not sprint or barely run. I finished the game off some how and throughout the game i tried massaging it out and stretching it. At halftime i even used the hypervolt massage gun on the spot but nothing got better. The spot was swelled up pretty good after the game. The next day (today) i still have some pain and swelling. I have had bilateral sports hernia repairs before on October and November of 2012.

Mri reveals","resp_content":"Hello,\nMy name is David and I am currently a second year Doctor of Physical Therapy Student. I too have suffered from chronic back pain that was limiting my ability to perform basic activities including walking. I was wondering if you have taken the opportunity to investigate physical therapy as a way to conservatively manage your symptoms?\nA physical therapist is a specialist of the musculoskeletal system who has the ability to identify your limitations and provide individualized interventions that have been proven by research to be safe and effective at resolving symptoms including low back pain. Treatment may include forms of mobilization/manipulation to increase movement of your spine, exercises to increase the strength and motor control of your stabilizing musculature and alternatives to managing your pain.\nIn terms of safety, physical therapy interventions have been proven to be much safer than surgical intervention. One study reported the risk of developing serious complications following a lumbar manipulation as less than 1 per 10 million treatments.1 The same study reported that exercise results in a single serious complication per 1.5 million cases.1 Alternatively, disc surgeries, including discectomy and fusion, were found to result in death at a rate of between 2 and 3%.1 This means that there is much greater risk involved when surgery is performed.\nNow that I have demonstrated physical therapy to be a safe alternative to surgical intervention, i’m sure that you are questioning the outcomes. Current literature suggests that physical therapy can prevent surgery while generating similar functional results. A study conducted by Delitto et al.2 found that physical therapy intervention which lasted 2 times per week for six weeks resulted in equal physical function scores when compared to surgery at a 2-year follow-up. Another study reported excellent clinical outcomes in 90% of the patients who met the typical criteria for surgery of a herniated nucleus pulposus and received physical therapy intervention.3 There is also evidence that physical therapy intervention can reduce overall health care costs drastically, lower the number of lumbar spinal injections received and reduce reliance on opioid medications.4\nIn your question, you mentioned that your MRI showed disc herniation and bulging at multiple levels, paired with a loss of disc height and narrowing of the foramen. While this sounds intimidating, I want to assure you that it is common for individuals to have abnormal findings on their imaging. In fact, one study reported imaging results which displayed disc degeneration in asymptomatic individuals which increased from 37% of 20-year-olds to 96% of 80-year-olds.5 This means that even those who do not report back pain often show abnormal imaging. I am concerned that these results have made you afraid of movement and exercise and assure you that these are key components to your rehabilitation.\nIn summary, I believe that seeking care from a licensed physical therapist will be beneficial to your current condition. This more conservative approach will help restore your functional capability while decreasing the pain that you’re experiencing. I know how frustrating back pain can be and want to assure you that your symptoms will improve. I also want to encourage you to take control of your condition by making decisions that are based on the best evidence available. For now, just remember that movement is a powerful tool that can improve your impairments and resolve your symptoms when it is prescribed appropriately by an expert.\nBest of luck,\nDavid\n\nReferences:\n1.

The nerve does regenerate, but the procedure is repeated if there is a significant amount of pain again. Fortunately, I've had a great pain management doctor for many years. He has always told me to never have surgery as this can open the door to more problems. RFA, performed by a good physician, may be helpful to you. I would be concerned about the amount of ibuprofen you take. Check with your doctor and make sure that it's ok for you to take the amount you're taking. Ibuprofen can cause many problems when taken for a long period of time and in a large quantity. Each person is different, but you should check to make sure that your doctor thinks the amount you take is safe for you. Good luck.

Telehealth is the use of digital information and communication technologies such as computers and mobile devices, to access health care services remotely and manage your health care (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2017). Telehealth is a great innovation for patients who have mobility issues or live far from medical facilities. Telehealth is beneficial tool in which patients will have pertinent information about their health at their fingertips. Patients are able to access information about their test results, ordering medication, scheduling appointments with provider(s), emailing your doctor, emergency information and more. Telehealth can also refer to remote non-clinical services, such as provider training, administrative meetings, and continuing medical education, in addition to clinical services (HealthIT.gov, 2017). Telehealth can be considered a wearable device because your personal health information can be accessed through wearable devices. The Health Resources & Services Administration, under the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human promotes the use of telehealth technologies for health care delivery, education, and health information services (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019). Telegraph is especially critical in rural and other remote areas that lack sufficient health care services, including specialty care (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019). The Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) promotes a variety of telehealth programs including Telehealth Network Grant Program (TNGP), Substance Abuse Treatment Telehealth Network Grant Program (SAT TNGP), Evidence-Based Tele-Behavioral Health Network Program (EB THNP), Telehealth Resources Center Program (TRC), Telehealth Centers of Excellence (COE), Flex Rural Veterans Health Access Program (RVHAP), Licensure Portability Grant Program (LPGP), and Telehealth and Focused Rural Health Research Center Cooperative Agreement (Health Resources & Services Administration, 2019).\n\nSpeaking from experience, I have benefited and enjoyed telehealth through my medical facility. I can obtain test results and medications through the system without having to contact my primary care facility. I can also stay in contact with my primary care physician and obtain referrals that I may have misplaced. If my physicians need to contact me or vice versus, we can email each other through the system. It is convenient for working adults that may not have time to see a medical professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMayo Clinic Staff. (2017, August 16). Managing your health in the age of Wi-Fi.

I appear to be experiencing some Ulnar Nerve compression in my left arm. Here is some background on what led up to this.\n\nI am a 33 year old Male, about a week and a half ago I was working on cutting deer meat when I cut up near the left tip of my middle finger (of the left hand) with a knife. I cleaned up the cut, applied isopropyl alcohol and Neosporin to the cut and put a bandaid on it. At the time I had no numbness or odd sensations in my hand.\n\nAbout 3-4 days after I took the bandage off and was noticing that I appeared to have some numbness in my hand, along with some pressure around the palm of my hand. I then started experiencing some warmthness in this hand, extending partially up my arm. When this started occuring I went to a Walk In clinic who looked at the cut and my hand and other than the cut didnt see anything abnormal. They prescribed me a 10 day supply of Amoxicillin for an antibiotic (in case there eas an infection from the cut) along with a 5 day supply of Prednisone, along with a Tetnis shot. I am not on my last day of the Prednisone course and I feel like I have much better sensation in my left hand and that my numbess is gone, however I've had compression in my Ulnar nerve for the past few days.\n\nThe compression appears to be centered mostly near my elbow, either on the inner side of the Funny bone, or just above it in my upper arm. It feels like in that one spot like the never is being pinched.\n\nI have no idea if the cut to my finger in any way could have caused this, or if it's pure coincidence. I will say that I have never experienced anything similar to this before. From what I understand the Ulnar nerve covers your pinky finger and right side of the ring finger, whereas my cut was to my middle finger so I dont know how the cut to the middle finger would affect the Ulnar nerve.\n\nIs it possible that I have some inflammation from the cut that is somehow affecting this nerve? Would you expect to see this compression if you did have an infection?\n\nI'm trying not to worry too much but at the same time I don't want to ignore the problem. Would a hand Surgeon be a good option to make an appointment with if this doesn't resolve over the next fee days or what would you recommend doing?

The solution I found was an inversion table. All other physical activities keep squashing discs and vertebrae, which makes the misalignment permanent.

I have more details below but I just wanted to see if this seems likely or not.\n\n\nDetails:\n\nI am a 33 Year old male, 5'11\", Crohn's which is under control, I have benign fasciculation syndrome (15 years, symptoms come and go), I also was diagnosed two years ago with epilepsy but I only had one mild focal seizure when that happened, had an MRI, no issues in the brain at that time.\n\nThree weeks ago I woke up with left arm (bicep/tricep) numbness. The next day it was both arms. Over the next couple days it evolved into pain in both arms and in my neck. It wasn't the spine, it was more the back/sides and going into my shoulders. A few more days passed and the numbness was gone and it was all pain. Fast forward two weeks after it began and I saw a doctor who said it was a little uncommon for it to affect both arms.\n\nShe gave me prednisone and flexiril for 5 days which lessened the symptoms but after I stopped the prednisone, the pain was back. I am experiencing a on and off fatigue in my arms (bicep/triceps), not forearms. I have pain in the neck area and a pain between left shoulderblade and spine which feels like a muscle cramp that won't go away. I did get another 5 days of flexiril because it eases the pain in my neck.\n\nI forgot to mention, I have had on and off 'perceived weakness' this whole time but I keep testing my strength and I am able to do as many push-ups as always, I have good balance but I do have the burning, fatigue feeling sometimes when I carry something.\n\nMy doctor said I need to schedule another visit after the current Rx of flexiril is completed if I still have symptoms which I will but I am a bit of a worry wart.\nThe thing is, I didn't have an 'incident' before this happened. I just woke up one day and this all began. Is it possible that I pinched a nerve in my neck while sleeping?","like_count":"0","tags":["Neck Pain","Back Pain"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/74479/cervical-radiculopathy-pinched-nerve-neck"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Migraines, Migraines and Migraines......","post_content":"Hi,\nI've suffered from Migraines since i was a small child. The throbbing for 3 days, sensitivity to everything that makes you want to cry out and scream and o ya the vomiting are my constant companion. When I'm not having Migraines, I'm having smaller irritating and uncomfortable headaches 3 to 4 times a week that I've just become accustom too. As I've gotten older I'v gained more triggers. Perfumes, nail polish, chewing gum to long, Cold air is a big one or the fan blowing air on me really gives me one fast. Chemicals, fresh cut flowers, alcohol the list goes on, anyway because of my Migraines theirs Alot of activities i cant do either like Concerts, every once in awhile i try one and yep always come home with a Migraine. Weddings to, Even when I'm a Bridesmaid i always end up with a Migraine, i guess its all the running around taking pictures outside then inside where the A/C is so FREAKING COLD, as soon as i feel it i know immediately I'm going to have another Migraine on another one of my Best Friends special nights. It happens so often I hope they don't think I just don't want to be their. Ironically in 2018 and 2017 I had a Migraine on one of my friends Birthday both years? Same friend? We were not meant to celebrate our 30th year together. I can't tube at the lake anymore, one round and Bam I'm done Instant migraine you can probably imagine my dismay I'm only 30. I've been to the Doctors I've got a Specialist and a Neurologist hey I've even got and amazing Chiropractor/Acupuncturist I like him best and i just had my first Daith done in my left ear which seems to help so far but ill get the other done in a month then we'll really see. So there's a little of my history for you. Now as much as i have Migraines theirs one thing I've always been able to take, one thing I've always loved, one thing that's never really bothered me and that's The Heat. I can work in it, swim in it, pick blackberry's in it, Garden in it, get sun burnt in it, bask in it, fish in it, clear a field by hand with a weed eater in it and I'll never get a Migraine. I drink a lot of water, i drink it all day and i pack it with me, and i sweat very little, or i guess i do sweat its just gotta get really hot for me to sweat like other people, usually when other people are sweating and turning on the a/c I'm still over here with my windows open, curled up on the couch in some sweat pants and having separation anxiety with my electric blanket. This is me cold natured, im never quite warm enough. Until last year anyway now I'm still cold and I still love all things warm but I can no longer work outside in the heat?? So I'm a 30 year old woman who now can't do the one thing left she had left that she loved. I don't feel sorry for myself that's life, now that I have more time to work outside in my yard It would figure It makes me Physically Ill to do so seeing as how it didn't make me physically i'll the 10 years before that but i didn't even have a yard then because i was too busy working 16 hours shifts. Now im finally at a place where life is slower for me, I can relax enjoy my yard, do some landscaping ect...... but my body wont let me, I was out side over the weekend for 3 hours in the heat of the day and its only around 82-82 here right now, plenty hydrated and by the time I got inside the pain was miserable, unbearable even, from 1130pm to 600am the next morning i vomited every hr to hr 1/2, this will happen every time i exert myself in the Sunlight i was hoping i was just under a lot of stress last year clear ground and putting in a new place and that's why i kept getting sick every time i went to work down their but now I've been working out in the yard this year and the same result. I did talk to my Nero Dr about it she checked my medicines and made sure they didn't have any side effects due to sunlight exposure ect..... and agreed that maybe it was just stress or my body and migraines are just changing and I'm just going to have to watch what i do. I'm really not her biggest fan as i don't think a perfectly healthy 30 year old woman should have to creep around my yard like I'm 75 or 80 and have an illness, their has to be a better way ???? I'm reaching out because i was hoping someone would have similar experiences and could help.

I have a long history of migraines. I'm on prophylactic and abortive treatments which are marginally effective. I also get many headaches. Some months the migraines or headaches are daily occurrences. However, I don't have your triggers. I am similarly cold natured and always wear more clothing than anyone else and never set my AC below 80. I too rarely sweat, however my skin will get quite red (I am fair complected) from extreme heat. It's been many years since I've spent much time in sunlight as I purposely avoid it but I recall sunlight exposure gave me a face rash and made me very fatigued with a generally ill feeling but I never even felt like vomiting. I do know that sunlight has a variety of ill effects on people like me who have SLE Lupus and migraines are common among lupus patients. You may want to look at the signs and symptoms of SLE Lupus to see if you relate to any of them. You are the right age and sex for onset, however, you really don't complain of any symptoms that are considered to be diagnostic criteria, but I know that people don't always think that that facial rash that comes and goes or those mouth sores that really don't bother them too much mean anything when in fact they are signs of lupus. My brother used to get physically sick like you do from sun exposure and I suspect he had Lupus or a similar auto immune disease (as they can run in families and he had other symptoms) but he passed away (from another cause) before he was tested. It would also explain why your neurologist is not helpful with this issue. If you read up on it and feel it is a possibility, either talk to your primary about it or see a rheumatologist and get evaluated and tested. The thing to focus on initially would be the ANA and inflammatory markers. Of course this could be dozens of other things too. I hope it's not lupus and I hope you find some answers and relief soon!\n"},{"author":"mefrecruiting10000560600","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Migraines, Migraines and Migraines......","resp_content":"Forget Web MD see a Chiro!\n\n\n<a href=\" https://khohealth.com/shin-splints-from-walking-and-what-to-do-about-them/ Splints Walking</a>\n"},{"author":"ethanscott278","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Migraines, Migraines and Migraines......","resp_content":"You sound like you have been through a hell lot and reached here to this point and I know how it feels.\nI myself have been a victim of migraine attacks and it used to trigger to almost anything other than normal fresh air.\nI know how terrible it feels to not be able to experience a different weather, it is indeed a terrible thing to come across.\nI found this treatment which my doctor recommended and told me is a solution and gives instant migraine relief(https://www.doctoroncall.com.my/general-health/instant-migraine-relief).\nWhile it might not be 100% effective for me personally, it works up to an extent for me\nI hope others can also benefit from these remedies.\nEither way, I wish the best to all of you guys suffering from chronic migraine and any other type and make sure you are stressfree at almost all times.\n"},{"author":"shelley1973","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Migraines, Migraines and Migraines......","resp_content":"I would recommend CBD oil.

I came into this world in the most horrific agony you could ever imagine. You see, when my mother was in labor, I was trapped, hooked around her pelvic bone and the cord was around my neck multiple times. They lost my heart beat, and at the time, the doctor did what he knew. He reached in and dislocated my right shoulder, prying me out, and then performing CPR. By some miracle I lived, but I couldn’t use my arm, and I screamed for months. The only thing in this bright world I knew was pain, from the very moment I came into it.\n\nEventually, through persistent physical therapy, I regained use of my right arm, though I was never able to straighten the elbow out. I was diagnosed with erb’s palsy as a result of being born with true shoulder dystocia, and thus my life began.\n\nMy toddler years were unfortunate. I showed excessive clumsiness my entire life, though there was no idea why until I was an adult. I was relatively healthy and happy for many years, showing promising intelligence despite beginning my time in this world dead. These few, precious years, I will know as the only time in my life I was not in agony.\n\nShortly after turning 10, I was in a bicycle accident that changed everything about me. I was always slightly off, but the accident introduced me once more to my first moments in the world. I flipped the bike going very fast down a hill. I remember the pavement coming up towards my head as my feet went straight up. I blacked out, and woke a few minutes later a good 10 feet from where I impacted, with my neck and upper back in the worst pain I had ever known. Being young and indestructible, my family didn’t think much of it, as I went back to playing not 2 hours later. Little could anyone predict that this was the accident that started it all.\n\nSuddenly, I began having these horrible pains in my back, spontaneously. I began suffering from migraines and almost daily headaches. Doctors simply gave me a few ibuprofen and sent me on my way.\n\nA few months down the road, while my mother was in the hospital with sepsis after having my brother, I was at the roller skating rink with my girl scout troop. I was having fun and participating in games, when I did the splits to show off. I’ve always been unusually flexible, so I wanted to impress my friends. I was rushed to the emergency room by my father after I started screaming and crying after doing it. In the E.R. I learned I had torn all of the ligaments around my kneecap and was put in a leg brace for nearly six months. My elementary school, being full of adults who didn’t know kids could be in pain, wouldn’t let me use the elevator, so I had to learn how to climb stairs in a leg brace.\n\nSomeday, my leg healed and I was back to being a kid again, with the exception of chronic back pain and now, occasional knee pain. When I was 16 I was diagnosed with arthritis in my knee, and sent to a chiropractor for my back, but it wasn’t helping. I began hurting more and more as the days turned to months and the months to years and no doctors cared. Eventually I was taking over 1800 mg of ibuprofen a day and my activity dropped substantially. My ankles began dislocating partially almost daily, and my knees both began suffering. I started twisting my good knee often, and falling down more and more. Still no one helped me.\n\nWhen I was 22 I had another accident. This one I refer to as the catalyst, because it threw my entire life into disarray. I was a groomer, and I loved my work. One day I was grooming a rather large australian shepherd, and went to lift him. When I did, I heard a loud pop in my right shoulder. I braced for the pain, but when it didn’t come, I felt relieved.\n\nThe next day I was unable to use my arm at all. It hurt so bad, and it felt hot to the touch. I saw an orthopedic doctor who told me to just not use it and wait a few months. I waited. Again I saw him and he put me in physical therapy. I went and within 10 minutes the physical therapist called my orthopedist and told him there was something structurally wrong, and I was being physically blocked by something because he could not move my arm.\n\nHalf a year after my accident, they did a surgery on my shoulder. I had multiple bone spurs, one shaped like a hook that was cutting the muscle with every movement, and my collarbone had fractured and been held in place by the amount of swelling I had. When they opened my arm up, the collarbone was almost powder. They shaved it off and rotated my bursa, which was also inflamed. Then it was back to PT for another 6 months. My pain became intolerable, my right shoulder muscles atrophied, my left shoulder started to hurt, and all of the pain I’d had before was now even worse. I was suffering.\n\nSome time later I started fighting. I went to doctor after doctor after doctor searching for answers. I changed jobs, finding one I could do without using my arms too much. One where I could sit, because my back and my knees hurt so bad. I went to every doctor and did every test and every stupid procedure and holistic treatment they threw at me from meditation and acupuncture to neck injections. Eventually I found a few doctors who all had a small piece of the puzzle that were the answers to my problems. MRIs that showed nothing, labs, xrays, nerve conduction tests, all came up normal. Somehow, though, I was diagnosed with dystonia, fibromyalgia, and facet joint syndrome. Do you know what they did for treatments? Muscle relaxers, some nerve blocks, a few epidurals, almost an entire year of steroids (which gave me diabetes, thank you), and nerve ablation.\n\nDo you know what has worked?\n\nNothing.\n\nAfter the nerve ablation I’m in even worse pain and now I struggle to use my hands. My neck is in more agony than my shoulders, which still also hurt, and my upper back is in so much pain I can barely stand it. My knees and my ankles dislocate almost daily, and I’m unable to do anything anymore. I can barely hold a fork. I’m now on actual pain medicine, thanks to my ablation, but they’re already trying to take that away, altering it to now be oxy and ibuprofen, putting more emphasis on going on ibuprofen, which has never helped ever since I was a child. I’ve been flagged by some as a drug seeker, an addict by others, and a hypochondriac by some more. “You’re too young to hurt so much” I hear. Yeah, I am, and yet here we are. I discovered a disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which would explain so much of my problems, including the famous clumsiness, but yet I cannot find a single doctor in over 300 miles to test me.\n\nI have racked up over $80,000 in medical debt just trying to survive. I’ve been denied any actual procedures that could help, and no one will treat my pain properly. I’ve been suffering for almost my entire life, however short it’s been, and not one person has actually helped me. My pain specialist in Omaha, over 200 miles away, has been the only one to keep trying after every failure. He’s the only one who seems to genuinely believe me. The others have all given up after one or two attempts. I’ve had neurosurgeons and pain specialists and oncologists and rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons and therapists and psychologists and even a stem cell doctor all shrug me off as either an addict or a lost cause, or my favorite, blaming my weight. (I weighed 98 pounds until I was 14, I was in pain long before I was heavy.)\n\nI keep grasping at every possible lead on someone who could do something. Someone who could help me, in any way. I don’t want to be on pain medicine, I don’t. I hate being drugged. I hate the feeling. Please believe me when I say I’ll try anything at all to feel better, yet the medicine is the only thing that makes me able to function so I can keep fighting to find someone who could possibly know how to help me. This has been my entire life for so long, an endless cycle of pain and hurting and doctors and helplessness and hopelessness and desperation for someone to help.\n\nI am going to be 28 in a month. I’m not even halfway through this life. There are millions of doctors and specialists in this world. Someone, surely, has the answers I need and the ability to fix me. Is it so much to ask to be able to go through the day without hurting? Is it so much to ask for someone to help? I have so much I want to do. I want to study radiology. I want to have children. I want to be someone more than just a pain sufferer. My body just hurts so much.\n\nI’m hoping someone will read this story and find it in them to help me. I know someone out there has to have answers, or ideas, or options.

I'm on a very low dose, just enough that I can get out of bed, and they're starting to try and take me off.

I suspected you had the same disorder that I have after only reading the first paragraph or two of your post. It wasn't until nearly the end of the post that I see that you have found the diagnosis already for yourself. I have Ehler Danlos Type 3 and I strongly suspect you are a fellow EDS patient.\n\nI got my diagnosis by seeing a geneticist at a large University hospital. If you want the full diagnosis you might wish to go that route, even if it means traveling to the nearest facility.\n\nEhler Danlos patients have a defect in the collagen their body makes. Since collagen is one of the major structural proteins in the body, EDS patients have tissues that are weaker than others. This can lead to soft tissue injuries that are frequent and debilitating. There is no \"cure\" for EDS. But by loving yourself and learning to listen to your body you can learn how to protect yourself from harm. Braces can be used to protect joints that are particularly weak. You can have a happy and healthy life, and you can have children! I have 3 whom I love with all my heart!\n\nMany people with EDS consider their EDS traits to be the unique parts of themselves that make them special. For example, many world class gymnasts are EDS patients. The extreme flexibility required of a gymnast comes easily to many with EDS.\n\nBe kind and gentle to your body. It will quit giving you so much grief I think? And look for an online support group of EDS patients. It helps to have someone to talk to!\nBest Wishes to you!\n"},{"author":"ladyalyx","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"My pain specialist is trying to force a geneticist to take me, but none in 400 miles seem to want to, and my neuro is sending me to a research facility 3 hours away next.

I have osteoporosis, fibromyalgia and herniated discs from L-4 to S-5 as well as some herniation in the cervical area. I suffer from sciatica, my left leg and foot are totally numb some of the time. I am not trying to one-up you, just share what has \"worked\" for me within the limits of insurance guidelines,financial constraints and medical discoveries ethics. I have had 2 surgeries, neither of which gave me any permanent relief. My last surgery was done 15 years ago, the first one 17 years ago. My neurosurgeon should have done a spinal fusion but He decided since I had young children I needed the mobility I would lose if he did a fusion. I had signed my permission to do a fusion if it was needed. I told him that I would not be having another back surgery. So surgery isn't always the way you want to go.\nOver the years I have found the following combination of meds to make my pain tolerable:\nCelecoxib 200mg 2 x's a day generic for Celebrex- an anti-inflammatory\nDuloxetine 60mg 3 x's a day generic for Cymbalta- an anti-depressant\nLyrica 75 mg 2-3 x's a day No generic available-\n***Neurontin is the closest substitute or the generic Gabapentin\nCyclobenzaprine 10mg 2@bedtime 1 or 2 during the day as needed\nTramadol 50mg 1 as needed during the day, not to exceed 6\nI have to take 2 of these at bedtime as well\nA lot of people can't tolerate this much medication but I can barely function without it. I still have some pain but I can function. I have a high tolerance to pain meds but don't take anything stronger than Tramadol because I don't want to become addicted to pain meds. I was originally put on the Cymbalta (Duloxetine) and Lyrica for my fibromyalgia but found that it the back pain as well.\nOutside the world of meds I have founding walking, stretching, yoga to help as well. The best form of exercise for back pain (especially low-back pain) is water aerobics. You can usually find classes at the local YWCA. If you have access to a pool you can do the exercises by yourself. There are several books out there as well. For several years I was unable to work, yet too educated to get SS Disability and I was so miserable and pain-ridden that I rarely left the house. I missed important time with my sons that I can never get back. Most husbands would have left me, I was lucky that mine didn't. I had seen my family Doctor numerous times for years, visited several neurologists, two neurosurgeons, a rheumatologist , a homeopathic and a chiropractor. Stay AWAY from the Chiropractors. They only make the situation worse.\nI finally made myself get up in the morning, do what I could for a while, rest for a while, do a little more, rest, until I learned what I could do without over-doing it and landing back in bed. My best advice to you is to not let this control your life, you have control over how you handle the pain. If you have tried these meds before and they didn't work for you try again, adjusting dosages and quantity taken. Our insurance company doesn't pay for any name brand drugs, such as Lyrica. I rely on my family doc for samples and I break down an pay for some out -of- pocket. Blink Health is a buying group started by 2 brothers that sells generics for a lot less than the drugstores. I order the Duloxetine from them because insurance will only pay for 1 a day and I need 3. I keep hoping they will negotiate some great deals with the big drug companies. Both my husband and I should be on Nexium but our insurance won't pay for it so they suggest omeprazole which does little good. Look them up at Blink.com and take a list of yours and your husbands meds and check pricing against what you are paying now. You can use your HSA account to pay. We have a high deductible plan so we go outside of insurance for some of the meds we need.\nI didn't mean to write a book, just offer you some ideas and hope that some of them work for you. Over the years as I have sat in doctors office (for years I took my Mom, my Aunt and Mother-in-law to their Dr. appts) as well as my many trips and one thing I have discovered is that women with low back pain rarely get extended relief from surgery. In asking hundreds I have only found 1 woman who has. Men seem to have much better results. I don't know if part of it is the way we are built, how our weight is distributed or just that we are stubborn and overdo it when we shouldn't. I have encountered several women who have had success with cervical fusion, as well as upper lumbar fusion but only the one with lower lumbar/sacral fusion. I have accepted that pain is part of my life and I have lost too much time to it already. Don't you let it take over your life. Hope and pray that this helps.\n3\n"},{"author":"thompson8671","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"I noticed you wrote Blink .com , another one I've used is GoodRX , good luck and hoping everything works out","resp_content":"1\nReply\ngreatg07\nover 1 year ago\nI couldn’t agree with you more.

I just joined, and this is my first post because I've seen to have been getting nothing but dismissive responsive for every doctor I've seen regarding this issue, and it's a very crippling issue to endure - I basically can not function normally throughout any given day due to this strange, scary pain that occurs on my left side neck/shoulder, in the \"pocket\" space where your neck and shoulder meet. I've been experiencing this pain since September of 2017, and have been dealing with it for about a year now, obviously. The pain is triggered by any one of these certain events, and those events are as follows: increased heart rate, heavy breathing, heightened pulse, use of left arm when lifting something heavy, deep breath all the way in, heightened blood pressure (like when entering a hot shower), having sex, especially as I reach closer to orgasm, and a few other events that I can't quite think of at the moment. The pain can be described as a \"pulse\" pain, that occurs WITH my pulse, as if a vein, nerve, or blood vessel is being compressed, and it's a strange, sharp, stinging pain that I can't quite describe other than what it might feel like to have your pulse hurt. The pain itself is about a 7 out of 10, but it's a 10/10 in its crippling effect; after it happens, I continue to have anxiety about it for pretty much the remainder of the day, and general anxiety about it even when it doesn't happen because I know it will happen when I do any of the things that trigger it. Since December of 2018, I've basically been regulating my heart rate and breathing so that I don't feel the pain - it only occurs for a few seconds, but my GOD is it crippling. Regulating my breathing and actions include things like resting at every landing after climbing stairs so that I don't exert too much energy, holding my breath when bending over to pick up something, or limiting my breath capacity allllll day, so that I never inhale too much air, which potentially triggers the pain, either because of lung expansion, or heart rate increase - I'm not sure which. Another thing, which may be unrelated, is that the same region where the pain occurs seems swollen or bigger than the other side, but I'm right handing and typically do everything with my right hand and right side, so there's no real reason why the muscle should be bigger on the left side than on my right. I've had CT scans, MRIs, XRays, and carotid Doppler, and nothing has been found yet. I've even had massages and chiropractic work - the chiropractic work seemed to cure it completely for about a week, then it came back again in full force. Another thing that may be related is that when I breathe very deeply, or when I'm reeaaalllyyy full from eating, there's a slight pain in my shoulder, somewhat near the area where I experience this pain, but it's not the same kind of pain. Feels like maybe a nerve is being pressed or something along those lines, which can only be associated with the fact that my stomach is very full, thus pushing other organs up and around etc, ultimately causing something up there to be pressed - like I said, I'm not sure if it's related. Before I continue, I'd like to hear some responses as to what you all might thing it is, and also what kind of specialist might I need to see to find out what it is, and what kind of tests should I seek, etc\n\nAge: 30 years old\nHeight: 5'10\"\nWeight: 188lbs\n\nI'll continue to provide as much information as I can to anyone who asks, and I certainly appreciate the help of the WebMD community.

I had been prescribed both hydrocodone and oxycodon (obviously not at same time ). It was major back surgery, 3-level fusion with laminectomies in 2 or 3 places. Recovery took a long time. I was lucky to get the surgery when I did. Otherwise, I would likely have been confined to a wheelchair without the surgery. I never fully recovered. However, a lot of pain continued, then diagnosed with some other difficult problems, such as M.S.\nAfter about 6 months, I had to see a nurse practitioner who decided I should be on a \"clean\" drug, and prescried Oxycontin. That wreaked havoc on my system and am unable to tolerate it. I require \"fast\" acting percocet. Doctors don't tend to believe me, but I was fortunate to find a chronic pain center that believes me and understands.\nBut the Feds, in all of their \"wisdom\" , have decided that there are too many opioids being prescribed for those with cancer and other severe pain. So they have cut back the amount that the doctors can legally prescribe. It has forced some innocent patients to go through withdrawal. That is IMHO CRIMINAL!!!\nMy point is that because of too many stupid or selfish people, the rest of us have to suffer. Not all long-term patients are addicts. There is a difference between addiction and physical dependance. Everyone needs to learn the difference. Stop making us miserable and worse off, and trust our doctors.\nI live in Arizona, and am from MO. I suppose I am fortunate that I was healthy there.

I just wanted to speak on the 'new DEA limit on the amount of pills being rx'd without having to have a prior authorization' which happened to me this week! I went back and read articles after having spent almost three (3) hours at the pharmacy (which he stayed open almost one hour late!). Our insurance provider did NOT notify us of the \"25% reduction\" of what the new DEA guidelines are. Apparently it was not known by my PMD's office, as they most DEFINITELY would have called for the prior authorization. This is only going to INCREASE the amount of \"street drug dealers\" and the amount of deaths associated with the so-called \"opioid epidemic\" , as the DEA is messing with the responsible chronic pain patients. If someone has been a chronic pain patient for a decade (or decades, like myself), and have BEEN taking the exact same dose for years, they should leave us alone!!! HOW is this 25% reduction in prescribed opioids going to HELP with the \"opioid epidemic\" is what I want to know!!! Fortunately, after being on the phone with out insurance provider (for one hour and forty-nine minutes), and finally getting through to a Supervisor, I was able to get an override, as I was NOT aware of the reduction, nor did I know a \"prior authorization\" is now required (\"IF it is approved\", per our insurance provider). Why would it NOT be approved, as I have had NO changes to my meds since the Spring of 2014. For this particular prescription (for BT pain), I have had no changes in it since 2013. I guess I just felt the urge/need to \"vent\", especially to people who UNDERSTAND! I do not know if anyone else has yet experienced this, but I hope you do not have to!!! Thank you for allowing me to vent ~ and possibly to inform others of this new law. If marijuana was legal, THAT would cut down on the \" opioid epidemic\" MUCH, MUCH more so than cutting our Rx's by 25%!!! I'm pretty sure the local \"street dealers\" are LOVING this... and even the dealers who sell Heroin, as that's what I have read, heard and watched (on TV) that people who can no longer afford their prescription medications, or whatever other reasons, but they turn right Heroin. (The TV show I was thinking of is \"Intervention\". http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/a-e-cancels-intervention-13-554399\n\nAlso, Dr. Drew Pinsky's \"Celebrity Rehab\" was canceled because of the amount of overdoses (or that's one thing I read)... but \"Intervention\" and \"Celebrity Rehab\" both had people who turned to Heroin once they were no longer able to get their once monthly Rx's!!!\n\nThank you for allowing me to vent!!\n2\nReply\nirishseven\nover 2 years ago\nI have not heard of any DEA mandated 25% reduction in narcotic prescriptions.

Regardless, these guidelines are recommendations. They do not have the force of rule or law. What did they tell you at the pharmacy, that you could not obtain your medications without prior authorization? Or, was this an insurance matter, that your drugs would be dispensed, but you'd have to pay for 25% that are now not covered? Who gives the authorization, the insurance company or the DEA?

Ugh.\n1\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nAfter being on Opioids for over 18yrs I’ve literally been through the ringer. In the beginning no Dr would prescribe unless you were in your final days of life (This started in Michigan) & I actually ended up having 2 surgeries that were unnecessary & was left with sever nerve damage. I recall a few days after my 2nd surgery smoking marijuana & to my surprise it worked but that was b4 Michigan legalized it & due to work my family re-located to NC. It was completely different having a Dr who gave me pain medication & I never though to research what I was on since I was told “Oxycontin wasn’t addictive”. Again that was 16yrs ago. Within 6 months my Dr had me on such a high dose I knew something was wrong since I still had pain & only felt high as a kite which was something I didn’t want or like. I asked for a referral to Pain Management at Duke and Thank God. The Dr at Duke was wonderful & completely understanding. I never expected to be 100% pain free all I wanted was to be able to function & care for my family with the bare minimum of relief. The Dr found out that I was allergic to that form of Morphine. All brands are chemically different to some degree. He lowered my dosage by 60% & put me on MS Cotin. I told him I’d do anything but surgery if he could help me to obtain a pain decrease of 50% and he did. Over the 16yrs my family Dr took over my care since Duke was 3-1/2hrs away & once my Dr retired I was referred to a Pain Mgt place closer than 3-1/2hrs to my home. I’ve been at this Pain Mgt practice for over 8yrs with one increase & 3 voluntary decreases & when my body felt like it was going through withdrawal I found that by adjusting the amount & times of day that I took it actually worked for me. My disease would go into remission from time to time & I knew time release meds might be unnecessary but I feared not being taken care of when I wasn’t in remission. Please no judgements I’m just being honest.\nNow this is what really annoys me I’ve taken 3 voluntary decreases, have been drug tested, pills counted etc. you basically are made to feel like a junky. Since June all these new reports have been issued or the CDC issues new prescribing guidelines & insurance companies are even now refusing to cover meds that are over their recommended limits. For what ever the reason is they always forget to factor in those who’ve followed the rules. I suffered a heart attack when my meds were decreased by 50% in 28 days time. Instead of having him decrease it again I just asked him if I could try as needed meds instead of time release. I’d recently been feeling a lot better & was experiencing gaps of no pain lasting up to 5days but feared that if I was honest & the pain got sever again I wouldn’t be treated. So I refused the scrip with the promise that if the pain became unbearable again that he’d re-addressed my care immediately. Two months later not only was my request ignored the tiny bit of pain meds I had been prescribed that were fast acting was cut in half again and then I was lectured on taking Xanax (10 pills a month prescribed) I was told I’d have to give them because the new laws here said there’s like a 70% rate of deaths associated with those on both. It was one or the other. I pulled my pharmacist aside in tears since I trusted his judgement & was shocked to find out that there was NO NEW LAW on patients who’d been on Opioids for over 10yrs & he even said that the Dr had done it to every patient who’s scrips he’d filled recently filled there but none of the other Dr practices were doing that at that time. I though my Dr must be getting ready to close his practice so I asked for a good Pain Mgt Dr. & Wish I could say there’s a happy ending to this but I was denied the ability to even be seen & the reason was that they felt they couldn’t help me. I cried I was excited about pool therapy & other ways to reduce my pain but the sad fact is that I will require some type of Opioid for the times my pain is unbearable & the 2nd place I tried told me I’d have to go on Subboxen if they were gonna treat me. Neither of these places bothered to read my records they just pulled up that state wide report that’ll show everything you’ve been on over a 6yr period. I didn’t fear that since I NEVER did anything that went against my Pain contract. My family Dr won’t write for pain meds, the ER isn’t gonna deal with this & my shrink mentioned that the ERs have recently been over run with people going through withdrawal cuz of this Dr. He left the practice for a few months trading jobs with another Dr & I was told he’d be back then. I’m so screwed obviously there’s more going on at that Pain Clinic. I have no idea what the answer is to all this & here those of us who’ve followed the rules & even gone above that because of these so called articles, guidelines & the CDC who think there’s all these Drs over issuing meds why don’t they update what year it is first. The reports were compiled from 2012-2015 information & changes were made during those years to address a lot of the abuse issues what the heck?!?\nI’ve decided to write a personal letter with a copy of my records & try one last time to be seen by a proper Dr willing to treat me with & without Opioids but deep down I feel already feel defeated.\nThe sad fact is that I’ve had to start to consider less than legal ways of pain relief. I pray every day & night for NC to pass the Weed law. As for the Opioid problem it’s always gonna be there and if people truly did their homework and went back in time you could actually buy your drugs outta the Sears catalog. Through out history there’s always been issues on how to treat those of us who suffer with pain & instead of blaming the Drs or patients or what ever. Why doesn’t the FDA approve a drug that’ll help those of us who suffer everyday that’s non addictive. In history there’s always been something addictive to *** about. Alcohol causes more deaths than anything and now Heroin has made a come back cuz of these so called reports. There’s gotta be something that’s non-addictive, & will help with pain but please Don’t bother telling me it doesn’t exist.

(Can I write that on this site?!?). At least you two were able to work out SOMETHING! I have had times when I needed more relief than what I get from my pain meds (granted, I have been on and off of pain meds since my late teens), so three decades is a while to have ones tolerance toyed with. I have been on this exact combo since the Spring of 2014, thank goodness, however, I don't know if you have ever heard of a leaf that has been around for centuries, that is grown in SE Asia, Africa, Borneo (Indonesia, Malaysia), Thailand, etc. (tropical regions). I have known of people (in the same FB groups) who have been on Heroin, other street drugs, \"liquid handcuffs\" (I'd never heard that term before to describe Methadone, which is rx'd for chronic pain and for people who want to get off of Heroin). Also, people who want, need or have to come off of their opioid meds, who either cannot afford their meds, failed a couple of drug screens at their PMS's office, have been going to a \"pill mill\" unknowingly (YES! It IS VERY possible to NOT know the history of a new doctor in 'the area!!), or for whatever reason, and they have used Kratom to help with the withdrawal symptoms, or to replace their opioid or Heroin because they simply don't want to take chemicals, and want a more natural approach to their health. I have tried, and used Kratom.... In fact, I keep some on hand at all times, as it REALLY helps with my depression, as I have been MORE depressed when I used to take antidepressants (like THAT'S a surprise! NOT!!! Just listen to the commercials all over the TV ~ ALL DAY LONG ~ and hear the plethora of side effects, i.e., \"DEATH or SUICIDE\"!!!) I don't know if this post will be posted or not, as WebMD is on the side of pushing pills on people versus taking the natural route...and are against the legalization of marijuana, even though it is KNOWN TO CURE CANCER(S), among a myriad of other plants, vitamins and supplements (vitamin B17, for example), but that's a different ballgame, per se, however, if anyone is interested in learning more about Kratom, I HIGHLY recommend doing your own research. One night a young man had Heroin in one hand, Kratom in the other. He was about to get sick as he needed his 'fix', just to feel \"normal\". He literally communicated with a group of people who were on FB, and in the group at that same time. People supported his decision of choosing the Kratom. Not only did he choose the Kratom, but he flushed the Heroin and has been clean ever since. He did NOT experience ANY withdrawal symptoms, because he dosed with Kratom every three and one-half to every four hours. Another FB friend of mine, who has attempted suicide MANY times, due to SEVERE depression, was on 13 different prescription meds for chronic pain, depression and a couple of other dx's. Last time we \" talked\", she was down to ONE prescription med!!! She also told her PMD, Psychiatrist and PCP doctors about the Kratom, as well as provided them with information about it and included samples and gave them to her doctors!!! VERY, VERY BOLD MOVE, but that's just how passionate she is about this leaf!!! She used to be an \"exotic dancer\" and lived a VERY fast-paced lifestyle, as most people in that field tend to \"grow up too soon\". (If I'm not mistaken, I believe she had been a 'showgirl' in Vegas, as she's been a dancer her entire life). I have read more stories like this than even I imagined I would. Sadly, I have known/known of seven people who have/had been using Kratom but chose to get high \"one more time\". Five of seven are dead; the other two are now homeless, lost the support of family and friends, have almost blown up a (now FORMER) friends house because, when out of jail, they were making \"Meth\"! Kratom helps with anything from A to Z, literally. It has even helped with my severe GI problems (which I was facing having my stomach removed, or what I have remaining. This is, OBVIOUSLY, NOT a certain thing ~ that it helped with my stomach ~ but there is nothing else that has helped!!).","resp_content":"\nI apologize for this post being so long, however, IF it gets posted, it is my HOPE that it will help SOMEONE!!! I want to make a suggestion to those who may be interested. PLEASE, I BEG of you... do NOT purchase Kratom from a 'head shop', or 'smoke shop' (whatever they are called these days??)!!! This has been a problem in the past, and one NEVER knows EXACTLY what they are purchasing. There have been things added to the Kratom that have caused people to act as if there may have been \"Bath Salts\" ~ and Kratom, an ALL NATURAL LEAF, will NOT EVER have that type of effect on someone!!! I would suggest to do your own research to include joining legitimate, FB groups. I would also suggest NOT to EVER purchase anything from any \"suppliers\" regardless of how tempting and how good their prices may seem. (You'd very possibly lose money and never receive anything!).

I don't want to be on opiates, can't find a doc who will give me any anyhow. I also have been severely depressed because my pain is so bad every single day! I started Kratom about a month ago, with much disbelief at first, and WOW was I surprised at how effective it is on my pain, depression, fatigue, etc...I've taken norco, oxy's, fentany, methadone, you name it, to treat my pain just so I can even get out of bed everyday, but now I haven't taken any narcotics for years for pain. I tried everything I could try in order to even just lower my pain to a 6. Kratom lowered my pain and still does to a 1! It doesn't make you groggy either, in fact it gives you energy on top of the pain relief, unbelievable and all this time right at my fingertips! My only fear is the nosey regulators making it scheduled, if they do that then guess I'll be breaking the law, because I'll be darned if I am going to suffer on account of the pharmaceutical companies wanting to cash out on the herb! Overtime the big pharma won't be making money off the opiates, due to new regulations for prescribing, so at some point they will learn what the chronic pain Community is using to treat pain (Kratom), and say oh heck no, we are going to make the money from it, not a vendor online, and there go the lobbyist with their tears and puppy faces, and money support begging for regulation of Kratom!

Just like the CIA did in the '60's and '70's by putting LSD and other psychedelics on the street with the hippie generation, they have done to the youth of the 80's by putting the opioids on the street.\nThe government is good at causing a problem and then blaming everyone else but themselves for a crisis and then mandating a solution. Just like the \"Fast and Furious\" fiasco, the government caused hundreds of deaths by giving the drug lords and their gangs the rifles! Don't be taken in by the deception and continual lies they are hissing from their mouths.\nBesides having the doctors being blamed and the addicts being blamed for the crisis, they are going to simply refuse to pay for opioids in Medicare and or Medicaid and probably will get private insurers to do the same as another wonderful solution. I see it coming. If you find a doctor to write a script, you won't be able to afford to fill it if insurance doesn't pay. Or you have a script but now no drugstore will fill it as the drugstores will stop stocking the opioids. Every avenue will be covered to conflict with a patient actually obtaining their needed pain drugs. This will happen and people will go postal because you cannot have patients who are suffering with intense pain and nothing will work to enable them to get relief smoothly. Try to solve any problem or attend a gathering while you have an exposed nerve tooth pain.\nThe government took over the opioids so, watch and get ready as the death rate will skyrocket and the illegal drug business will double or triple when those simply looking for something to stop their physical pain will end up either truly addicted to some sinister street drug or dead. We will see another government screw up- but is it really?

Your PM doctor is the only one who can guide you in what the options are.\nYes, tolerance occurs, but not nearly as frequently as some assume, nor for the reasons some believe.\nIf someone is using opiates on a regular basis, such as the case of extended release medications, with immediate release meds also used to manage 'breakthrough' pain on a semi or regular basis, you can wind up creating a false appearance of 'tolerance', if you try to revert to just the extended release meds alone. Anytime you add to an opiate level in your bloodstream, and you do so on a regular basis, you are acclimating your body to expect the higher level of opiates.\nThere are a few ways to keep tolerance issues away, and keep them from occurring. Switching an opiate to another brand, usually results in being able to lower the dose and still provide pain management, particularly with extended release versions. Converting to a different long acting opiate every 6 months to a year works pretty well to prevent/minimize tolerance issues. Even going off a current long acting opiate for a few months can help reset tolerance.\nIf you are taking both long acting and breakthrough opiates, combining other methods to try to manage increased pain levels and minimizing the use and frequency of immediate release opiates also helps keep tolerance in check. For me, I use ice, topical pain relief creams and rubs, anti inflammatory meds, hot showers/baths, and rest to try to ease increased pain before I use my breakthrough opiate. If I do take my breakthrough, I start with half a dose and continue the other pain reducing options and wait half an hour to see if it helps, if not, then I will take the other half. I also avoid taking them on a consistent basis.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Opioids for Chronic Pain Management","resp_content":"I have severe pain and have had a horrible time getting strong enough medications to deal with it.

But everyone is afraid to comment for fear their pain medication will be taken away, their doctor will be reported and possibly lose their license, some pharmacists are acting like the FBI and reporting patients and doctors for any little thing they (not your doctor) believe is incorrectly prescribed.\n\nPatients in pain management, IMHO, have resorted to pain management because they've tried every other option available to them to manage or control their illnesses or conditions. Pain management is a recognized medical specialty. WHY is the government interferring with the patient/doctor treatments that are actually helping the chronically/ critically ill? Two words:\nOpiod Crisis.\n\nIt's more like Opiod Hysteria. The patients in pain management are truly SUFFERING because their effective treatment plans are being made illegal, shameful, and dangerous for doctors to prescribe. The Opiod Crisis came about because so many people have died from Heroin overdoses. And it's believed that 10% did use opiods before moving on to heroin. That's the difference. The Opiod Crisis is an illegal drug use problem. The government is not going to save anyone's life by taking pain medication away from chronically/critically ill patients. I Know, pain medications taken over many years can cause other problems, but without pain medication, hundreds of thousands of perfectly wonderful, law abiding Americans, will become bed ridden, suffering needlessly, and a burden on society, which not one of them want to be. Many may very likely end up on that heroin overdose roster, searching for a merciful end to unbearable constant pain. I've read that in some practices, patients have committed suicide because they cannot live with the excruciating pain they are once again forced by the government and media to endure. They know what a managed pain controlled life is and they are thrown back into the darkness that is:\nALS, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Anklyosing Spondilytis, Lupus, Inoperable back pain, Fibromyalgia, Rare Genetic Disorders, Cluster Migraine Headaches, Parkinson's and SO MANY MORE...\n\nWhat about Veterans that have been wounded in combat? OH, also, you now cannot have any psych meds if you take pain meds. The combination is 'too dangerous'. Patients have been on these medications for decades and led completely normal and safe lives.\n\nDependence, Addiction? The way I understand it is that as long as the medication truly has a purpose, true inflammation-or pain, your body may become dependant on the meds, meaning you will need them to maintain your progress. If there is no purpose for the medication, your body will become addicted, and will make you sick until you provide it with what it then believes it needs.\n\nI have Crohn's Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Anklyosing Spondilytis, Firbromyalgia and a host of other things that require specialist's care but not pain medication. I have had 5 surgeries, I have had both knees replaced, one hip replaced, the entire right section of my large intestine removed with complications including sepsis and having to open the surgical wound, and later repeat the surgery. I was in hospital for a full month in which time I was overdosed on medication and nearly died. Another time I was given a wrong medication and stopped breathing 4 times and had to have full code called to revive me. Even though my joints are replaced, Rheumatoid Arthritis still attacks the tendons and ligaments around that joint and all the other joints in my body. I cannot have my entire skeleton replaced.\n\nPain medication has kept me functioning. It has allowed me to have a life out of bed writhing in pain. It has allowed me to enjoy my family and my new grandbaby. I have gone from laying in bed, crying and moaning, suffering in imobilizing pain, unable to walk, having to use a scooter just to get around inside my house, unable to do the simplest things like taking a shower or cooking a meal, to a moderately happy and managable life thanks to managed opiod pain medication-at levels that are quickly being criminalized by society.\n\nI guess the point to this ramble is that the government and media have adopted a slogan \"Opiod Crisis\" much like \"War on Drugs\" or \"Reefer Madness\"? They are incorrectly assuming that ALL Opiod use leads to Heroin, which can ultimately lead to death. I am truly heartbroken for those who have lost loved ones to this illegal drug problem. I am also heartbroken that the ones who will pay the price are not drug dealers who supply heroin, but those SUFFERING with chronic /critical pain. We will die. The numbers of deaths will surely rise. The number of heroin addicts will absolutely rise as formerlly managed pain will return to unbearable excruciating pain. Without legal medicine, some may turn to anything that will help relieve their horrific pain.\nReally, America? Is this what you want? Veterans suffering after combat wounds, grandmothers unable to get out of bed, children with life long illnesses suffering, chronically ill patients SUFFERING, all because there should be a war on drugs and drug dealers, not a punishment for pain managed illnesses?\n\nThe government should stay out of my relationship with my doctor. My doctor knows me and my illnesses and medical records best. We've tried every option together. We know the level and variety of medications that work best for the whole of my conditions. Don't tell my doctors what limited amount of which medication he can give me. What is safe? Really? I've been on 5x the amounts that will be allowed by next year, and in combination with other meds .\nIf you think I'm just whining, wait until it happens to you. The government may begin dictating ALL of our medications and limits doctors may prescribe. Your blood pressure meds, your glaucoma meds, your after dental surgery meds, your (fill in the blank) meds are just an thought away from being regulated by what the Government says you may or may not have and may or may not have with this or that other medication.\n\nRight now it's sad to be in chronic pain. Actually Pain Management doctors have seen the writing on the wall. Many are leaving practice. Some are changing fields. Others will tow the government line and tell you this is all false- because they are being WATCHED. Pharmacists are being WATCHED as well. We are being WATCHED, and punished.\n\nGod Bless you for what you are having to endure , pain that you know could easily be managed with a few simple meds that you have taken in the past, that are now being regulated by our government. The cost of insurance will surely rise as the chronically ill are taken off meds and require hospitalizations for various aspects of illnesses that are unbearable without pain management. There will be more suicides. There will be more heroin use. There will be more drug dealers in our communities, around our children. There will be a huge draw on society as the number of people who can no longer manage for themselves begin to increase rapidly. Medicare/ Medicaid will feel the burden of the newly 'handicapped' needing help because they can no longer be a part of the work force. Hospitals will see an increase in emergency room admissions... I see a dark future. I see the pain. I know the pain. I pray for all of you in horrific pain, and for those in the future who will never know any type of relief from serious pain because someone's phrase, \"Opiod Crisis\" was taken as a truth applicable to any and all use of pain medication, legally or illegally. Separate the legal from the illegal. Catch the dealers of heroin. That is not going to stop because legitimate pain medications are being restricted or prohibitted. Dealers will always be there. The \"Opiod Crisis/Hysteria\" will not reduce the rate of deaths due to heroin overdoses. It will, increase pain and suffering. It will disable hundreds of thousands of people who Could lead a decent quality of life. It will increase the suicide rate and cripple our hospitals, social services and medicare, medicaid systems.\n\nShould patients live in fear of government policing treatments, doctors, pharmacists and medications? And you know, once the government gets involved in one branch of medicine, or medication, it has license to do whatever it choses to any other medication, field of medicine, or doctor / patient relationship. Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid. If you are not currently afffected by this Hysteria, you or someone you know or love will be affected in the near future. Keep the government out of our doctor/patient relationships and out of our medical care. And please, don't get me started on Insurance companies dictating what doctors can and cannot prescribe, or what medications they will or will not pay for, or who they will or will not allow to even purchase decent health insurance policies. It's not the best time to be an American, or at least a chronically ill American.\n3\n"},{"author":"bamawilson1","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"I agree. Going through the same.

I completely understand and know and feel exactly what you’re dealing with. I have struggled for years with this anI was doing everything on my own (divorced) single mom of 3. I wish I had the answers for you! Now my children are older and out of the house, oldest moved from PA to NC so I hardly ever see him, my daughter is married and I have 2 grandchildren, I have not seen her in 5 years and only saw my 2 grandchild once from a distance at my youngest Graduation ceremony. She doesn’t understand everything that I have been dealing with and she left home after she graduated from Dental school, and after I found her an outstanding job! One she wouldn’t ever have to worry about someone else supporting her or children if needed. My youngest, who I had full & complete custody of since he was 3yrs old, decided that he wanted to know who his father was... (truth-his father is a now a prescribed drug addict, former street addict, arrested & has been deceitfully and unlawfully using the system for most of his life-POS he is!) he has lived with him since his Jr year in high school and was an outstanding student, in JR Marine ROTC program and had everything going for his future, we were extremely close, just as I was with my older 2 children, mannerly, outgoing, know very well by all in our community as well by the Marine Corp... since he started living with his PIS-father he dropped out of his love & life passion for the Marines, almost quit school and is barely making it through life, thanks to his POS – father. I have not seen him in three years now. Him & his drug addict wife have my youngest so brain washed it breaks my heart, especially since I raised all 3 on my own!!! I had no choice but to quit one of the best jobs ever with outstanding benefits, insurance, 401k, retirement pay, etc... as I now am on SSD ONLY with aweful insurance and no one to help me with even the smallest things because my children saw what I was going through but I did everything in my power not to show them how I was/is actually feeling and for that they don’t understand exactly what I am dealing with 24/7... As far as I’m concerned the government should not be dictating to what our doctors, Pain mgmt., or Specialists how to treat us!!! We are not “Drug Addicts” we ar TRULY IN PAIN BECAUSE OF INJURIES OR SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES!!! They are treating us like we are and because of the Heroin and Opiate abusing the medication that we really need just so we can have some type of quality of life, we are now suffering because of it!! They need to use their resources and time and get the abusers and dealers and put them away or in a treatment program and STOP TAKING IT OUT ON US!!! My prayers are with you and I hope you are able to find someone who can treat you the way you deserve to be treated, a person with true health issues and in chronic pain, especially since that is why they have Pain Management!! My are with you and please, if you wouldn’t mind, keep me posted with your progress and finding someone who will treat you with the compassion and understanding what you (us) are dealing with.

I also have a litany of other health problems that no doctor has been able to decipher.\n\nWhat I’m looking for is someone who can point me in the direction of an effective, affordable medical professional close to home (NE Dallas suburbs) who can provide real solutions to my health problems.\n\nHere is the long list of my health problems, things I’ve tried, and restrictions on what I can try next:\n\nHealth problems\n\nUpper back and neck pain for about 12 years\nNo MRI, X-ray, or other scan has ever revealed anything significant to any doctor, including the nation’s best spine specialists in the DC area.\nBack pain has spread to my lower back over the past three years\nIt now feels like I have a severely broken joint/disc of some kind in my lower back\nIt is impossible to stand up straight anymore\nIt is very difficult to walk\nMy poor posture from the back problems has led to pain spreading throughout my legs, causing very strained thighs and knees.\nIt has also led to very weak and clumsy arms and hands\n\nI also have severe digestive problems that have loosely been called IBS-D. This keeps my energy level, appetite, and strength very low\n\nThings I’ve tried\nMany many licensed, respectable, highly reputable doctors across the country, literally from coast to coast. Including general primary care doctors, spine specialists, GI specialists, pain management specialists, chiropractors, rolfing, airrosti, physical therapy, massage therapy, accupuncture, nutritionists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.\nI’ve actually followed the directions of these specialists for years and found little to no relief.\n\nRestrictions that make it hard to find help now\nMy health has gotten much worse over the past two years. It is now very difficult to walk, keep my energy level up, and focus for very long.\nI’m now very low on money.\nI worked decent-paying white collar desk jobs around DC as a PR manager for a few years. I had some income and full benefits. But health insurance covered very little of the financial burden. So I burned through a great deal of money trying new doctors and trying to pay for the exorbitant testing and treatments they prescribed.\nI started my career in the US Air Force. So I am a veteran with an honorable discharge and proof of service (DD Form 214). I’ve been to military hospitals across the country while on active duty and to VA hospitals as a veteran. The level of care is atrocious. And they have taken to blatantly lying about how much the care will cost me. They have claimed it will be free only to send me massive bills several months later. The VA has been unable to offer any help. But my status as a veteran means that I don’t qualify for other low-income health care options. I also don’t qualify for the veterans choice program because I’m within 40 miles of the Dallas VA hospital.\nI have no one who will help. Due to worsening health problems, I was coerced into moving home with my parents at the age of 32 last year. I didn’t know what to expect but didn’t think I could manage on my own at the time of decision. Once I had given up a lucrative job, friends, and a home in DC, I was stuck in Dallas in my parents house. They are upper middle class and enjoy perfect health in their late 60s. But they are extremely religious pseudo-faith healer believers and refused to offer any assistance to get medical help. And my health has worsened over the last year since moving home.\nI do not fall into any other so-called “sympathy demographics” other than being a veteran. And I’m not a combat veteran, so I do not qualify for any of the countless charities helping combat veterans (such as the wounded warrior project). I’m 33, straight, white, male, single, no kids, veteran, with no medical testing to prove any health problems. I’m not healthy enough to work anymore to get money or health insurance. And I don’t have enough money to cover much more health care. And I have no one willing to help me find good health care. And I have no one to help me deal with the endless hassle and confusion of battling with doctors and their offices even if I could afford their services. This is another significant obstacle to getting help. I’m not in good health so I don’t feel strong enough to fight doctors to demand good solutions. And doctors have a first instinct to get rid of the patient as fast as possible while saddling them with an array of unfamiliar expensive tests.\nMy health continues to worsen. I have been very blunt about this with my parents. They have clearly said they refuse to help. They said to get a job and move out. That is also my end goal. But I need better health to pull that off.\n\nPlease let me know if you know of anyone offering low-cost effective health care in the NE Dallas suburbs. I have a bit of money, no health insurance, and must drive myself to any appointments. So it must be within a short driving distance so I can safely get there.\nThank you very much for any help.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Medication","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"ahnesd","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: finding effective affordable help","resp_content":"I wish you well\n\n<a href=\" https://khohealth.com/how-to-find-a-good-massage-therapist/ to Find a Good Massage Therapist</a>\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/60877/finding-effective-affordable-help"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"ear pain when swallowing and sore scalp","post_content":"It started with cold like symptoms including a minor sore throat and lots of yellowish green mucus.

I'm on Medi-Cal/MediCaid, & want to know if anyone knows if this is true, or not.\n\nMy reasons for refusing the procedure stem from event that I still remember like it was yesterday - I was taken in by my mom for my regular check-up & had to go back to have 3 cavities filled. After 3 injections given to me in gums to deaden nerves & waiting 5-10 min to work, dentist began drilling. I screamed out immediately in pain, & told him I could still feel him drilling, which he didn't believe, however he administered a few more injections & waited another 5 min, he started drilling again, & again I screamed out in pain refusing to allow him to continue because I told him I could still feel him drilling as if I'd been given no novacaine at all. He called my mother in the room, telling her I wasn't cooperating & claimed I could feel the drilling, but he insisted there was no way I could feel anything due to the amount of novacaine he'd given me. So, my mom was on one side of me, & a nurse on the other, and they held me down so he could continue. I have never forgot that pain; & it has haunted me throughout my adult life - once I was out on my own I stopped going to dentists & doctors - until at 51 1/2 of my teeth had rotted out & had several abscesses from years of neglect, & had to have the 10-14 still left surgically removed while put to sleep. Started having very bad back pain a year later, & as my dad has serious back problems (he's had back surgery twice with each leaving him worse then he was before each. He's had pain pump put in under skin which is filled with morphine every few months to help with pain & is only mildly effective at doing this. He had to quit working abt 30 yrs back due to his back) & I take after him in nearly everything - including these back problems, which his dad also had. My PCP referred me to pain mgmt immediately after his initial script for tramadol & said I would have to get that script from them from then on, which I have done.\n\nIs it true that my doctor will have to stop giving me the Tramadol because I do not want to have the spinal injections done, & leave me in excruciating pain for the numerous back problems I have which have been diagnosed thru X-rays, & MRI's?","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Medication","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"ahnesd","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: refused spinal injections for pain mgmt of degenerative disk disease","resp_content":"First of all I wish you well, for me, I will follow the doctors advice and prescription.

I have had 19 procedures of injections by 7 differently doctors over past 12 years. I am In Florida by the way which is a factor to your question, but only if you also live in Florida. I cannot tell you that it is the law that you have the injections but I can tell you that each of my doctors did require that I at least once give the injections a try and this was early in my relationship with these doctors. You stated that doctor told you it is his duty to try and provide you with pain relief through means other than jumping straight into Opiates. I have been told the same thing. I get it I guess. They are trying to weed out the fakers who are just looking for drugs. Most people that are just drug seekers will not want to endure pain spine injections and will just move to the next doctor until they find one that will just give them drugs. I have never balked on a doctors request for me to give the injections a try because I would try anything if it meant some pain relief. So in Florida this is why they push first for trying the injections. Don't know about any other state. For what it is worth, I never got an once of relief from any injections. But I know that some do, like my aunt who gets about 2 years relief before doing again. I don't get it? Oh, last thought, of two of my doctors over the years, it was just their standard procedure policy to anesthesia put me to sleep for the approximately 10 minute procedure, which was ok with me. Maybe look for a doctor that uses this method.

I was able to obtain relief for about 1 1/2 years with 3 of my injections, but my 4th injection in my lower back, only about 6 months. I live in NC and Drs here are really cracking down on opioids trying to find a different pain Med that's not a narcotic. I'm on 1800mg of Gabapentin a day, and 5/325mg of Norco PRN. In all my epidural injections, they were guided injections with X-ray and I received a small shot of lidocaine before the injection. You can feel \"pressure\" with the injections but not pain! One of the epidural injections I received in my neck, did hurt a little like a small sting, and I told the Dr it was hurting. He stopped and gave me more lidocaine and that helped a lot. It's going to depend on who you go to. All my epidurals were given to me by different Drs each time. Make sure if you do decide to have the Epidural, ask them up front if they are X-ray guided injections! If not! RUN!! There are way too many Drs that do good jobs for people, and we shouldn't be subjected to this type of pain when it's not done under local anesthetic! Epidurals that aren't guided, have really hurt people from those I've known.

I went to a doctor and got X rays done. The doctor called me the next morning and essentially just told me it wasn't a break. I spent 2.5 weeks resting, icing, elevating, wrapping. It was getting better, but I scheduled with an orthopedic specialist to see when she thought I could return to cardio - I work out regularly and running or at least doing the elliptical have always been part of the routine, it's been years since I've gone more than like 4 days without cardio. I took the results of my x ray, but didn't have the actual disc of the x ray. The specialist examined and diagnosed a high sprain, which is apparently worse than a regular sprain, and put me in an Aircast boot for 4 weeks. She said I could try the stationary bike or even the elliptical in the brace and I was excited. Well, 20 min on the bike had me in pain. I tried it again the next week, still pain. I tried it for 5 min the next week, pain. It's been 3 weeks in the brace, 6 weeks since the sprain, and I'm still in pain even though I'm resting all the time, icing 3 times a day, elevating when I can, taking anti inflammatories, wrapping in an ACE bandage, and wearing the brace most of the time I'm walking. Honestly, it feels like the pain has gotten worse. The pain I experienced after going without the brace for a while Monday was much worse than what I experienced after 20 min on the bike when I first got the brace. My muscles are tight and swollen and I'm experiencing shooting pains and sometimes burning. I can bear weight and walk fine, but I'm still just in pain. And my knees are hurting now too. I'm seeing the specialist Tuesday but I'm just reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced a high sprain and can tell me if it's normal to still have so much pain even after resting and taking care of it. My body image and mental health issues are awful right now, and I've been having panic attacks because I feel like something is permanently damaged and I'll never run again and I just can't imagine a life like that.

Wow, this got long. Oh well, even if no one reads i can use it elsewhere i guess )\n\nOkay, firstly i'm here now because after just getting off the phone with my doc who I wont see till the tenth I am flummoxed to her advice and what I should or can do.\n( For the second time, she suggested to 'lay in a dimly let room with a warm cloth on my head' and when she asked what im taking for the pain, Ibprofen like she told me to and if it helped, which is not much, she told me then to not take it. )\nI've only seen her a few so far, so she is a rather new doctor for me and I feel there is alot more she should know about my issues.\n...but personally, so far I feel like she is not actually concerned or taking my problems seriously.\nHer first advice for the migraine issue ( before the chronic onset )\nwas to stop taking any kind of headache medicine for a couple weeks or so and that taking it so often was the cause of them being so frequent. I went along with it, it wasn't fun and resulted in me simply suffering through them and inhibiting me from being able to do anything else really.\nBefore getting into some past info, whats been going on for the past several weeks has been rather unbearable...\nI often have migraines, but been a very long time since theyve been this bad.\nEvery day, there is pressure on both sides of my head, specifically at temporalis area. Along with a horrible knot on the back of my skull, (occipatilis). My necks been stiff ( Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius mostly, but much of neck really ) especially awful are then occasional pops in the vertebrae, which despite all my efforts stretching properly usually feel like an awful pinch and burning instead of relief.\nAt the onset of this onslaught, i also had severe vision problems, eyes were very red and had ocular pain even when closed. My temples throbbed and ached, really my entire head. I felt feverish and been having awful memory problems and some problems with my balance too. And the terrible ringing in my ears, UGH. Sometimes its a real high pitched, intense tone that gradually fades ( feels kinda like someone hit the reset button on my brain for a moment) And ive realized the ear ringing is actually constant and nonstop now, just varying in strength.\nI eventually was able to make a next day appointment with another doctor at the physicians building, who gave me a shot of turidol and something else for the nausea. I immediately regretted not remembering to ask if i should get an MRI or could be referred to a chiropractor or something. Honestly, i have no idea how i failed to bring that up when it was all i had been thinking about before.\nSo the shots helped, I was able to relax and get some relief for a while. As the migraines returned, they were accompanied by the severe neck issues and lower back ( lumbar ) as well.\nIt feels EXTREMELY stiff, like my spine is totally kinked and any kind of movement associated with it is met with very uncomfortable pain and resistance.\nIm not sure if its possibly an underlying cause, or was made worse by not getting it enough exercise or something lately.\nHOWEVER, just before all this I was lent a gazelle and have been using it frequently since. If anything ive been alot more active, despite the few days after the shot which I spent in bed primarily. After that though is when the overall stiffness became most apparent.\nOne thing i noticed right away using it is how strange it felt to use, as much as ive been using it ( this is rather hard to explain exactly ) it feels like my legs arent fully 'engaging', as if theres some disconnection or total weakness in my thighs an upper legs. I know how a total stride should feel, but even when i assist with my arms to get a stronger, deeper one... nothing.\nAnd despite my efforts, ive gained back the weight i recently lost last month somehow.\nI've gained considerable weight over past couple years, never been over 190 and now Im at 212-220. =(\nMy only past surgery was for my eyes years ago when i was having\nsimilar migraine issues ( 6-8 hours at least, fever, unable to focus ) 'Strabismus' he diagnosed.\nAs scary as eye surgery was to me, I was willing to do whatever it took so i could do things like enjoy drawing again.\nI have to wonder though now if it was merely a temporary fix to an underlying problem, as now Im experiencing the same thing again.\n...my eyes are visibly scarred forever and noticeably ( to me at least ) altered in position. Frequently dry eyes as well and most eye drops i cant use as they instead cause burning pain and irritation.\nA couple years ago I saw a physical therapist who after making me into a pretzel, etc ( lol ) concluded I could have Marfans syndrome as i showed alot of characteristics. And after reading bout it, I felt the same. Enough to go and get an EKG done as he suggested, which came out fine. However, that just means it hasnt progressed to that stage ( aortic dilation or aneurysm ) which is the last fatal stages.\nFurther diagnosis however has eluded me so far, as there doesnt seem to be an easy way for me to get tested genetically locally.\nAnyways, one of the symptoms is dural ectasia, which I feel perfectly fits several issues ive been having over the past few years.\n( the occasional bladder issues which have dumbfounded me, and the numbness which i apparently have just become accustomed too )\nLast time when i mentioned bladder issues, i was sent to get xrays and mris done. ( i was kinda surprised how serious they take it ) But all they said was that there was a slight disc bulge or something, prescribed me some muscle relaxers, etc..\n...I'm wondering now if it was possibly misdiagnosed as that instead. I don't think they managed to actually get a proper MRI while i was there, as I had trouble remaining still whilst entubed. ( id try an relax and be still, then once the whirring started id jolt uncontrollably for some reason. )\nI'm supposed to be setup to see a neurologist at some point, still waiting for that.\nWhen i mentioned a possible mri to doc, she said \"Well there is no reason really for one, unless youve had some kind of tremendous thing occur to you that hits like a massive thunderbolt\" and some other jibber jabber that befuddled me.\n...I have to question this, as i mentioned before how when i mentioned bladder issues to another doc they sent me off to get one right away...\nWhile there is probably more I could say, this is all i can manage for now.\nRegards.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Headaches","Neck Pain","Migraines","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"honge5","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Migraines, spinal stiffness, pain everyday, eye issues...","resp_content":"Hi orosefox,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about all this.

The article also says that these are the least common of all headaches and the cause is unknown, but it is known that a nerve in your face is involved, creating intense pain around one of your eyes. Cluster headaches are usually one-sided. Since this sounds relatively similar to what you described, you might consider mentioning this possibility to your doctor.\n\nNew daily persistent headaches (NDPH) begin without warning and go on for 3 months or longer.

If you do that regularly, it helps even when you're not having them. Hope that helps.\n"},{"author":"victory124","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Pain radiating from right lower back to foot","resp_content":"AFTER SUFFERING WITH JOINT PAINS FOR MANY YEARS AFTER MY TIME IN THE SERVICE MY DAUGHTER RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO ME AND ITS BEEN A GOD SEND .

I used to have similar symptoms to yours, although to a lesser degree. I recently found a YouTube video by a physical therapist by the name of Dr. Jacobs. I watched his videos and realize that treating chronic pain needs to be approached holistically. He has multiple videos pertaining to back pain where many patients have had success with alleviating chronic pain. He places an emphasis on the biopsychosocial model to treat pain, which is to correct the multitude of variables that could aggravate your pain (inflammation, nutrition, scar tissue, etc.).\n\nI've attached a link to one of his many videos for back pain below that you can refer to if you're curious:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I2vmRnZILc&;index=48&list=PLntIE3VEWChJpuc1Qe-aUHcr9Yp2xep8N\n\nI hope you get better soon,\nAlbert\n"},{"author":"lizzzard385","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"Thank you, Albert!

After playing for about five minutes I felt my back to seize up on me and getting stiff. I immediately stopped playing and sat down when my lower back started to spasm to a point where I could not stand straight up without severe pain. I got home and laid on the carpet floor in a fetal position for about three hours due to the intense pain and the fetal position was the only relief. I finally got up when my legs started to tremble in pain and legs were very weak to stand on. That night I had back spasms and started to have numbness to both my legs. The next morning the spasms were gone however still had terrible low back pain and legs were very weak and numb to my feet!!\n\nTo fast forward to 8 weeks later and having an MRI and X-rays done I still have both legs numb with little improvement however I'm able to walk very gingerly and a little off balance. I cannot run or do lunges or jump due to leg weakness and fatigue. My legs are very very slowing gaining strength back and the back pain has improved a lot faster than my legs!! The MRI did not reveal any impingement on the nerve but did show spinal stenosis which does not explain the leg numbness and weakness... I did go to the spine specialist who did not provide any answers due to ordering more testing which takes a month to perform!!

These were pretty normal tension/stress/strain headaches with an occasional severe migraine thrown in. Until recently I called it a migraine if it did all of these: near blinding pain, nausea, vomitting, sensitivity to light, sound, hot, cold, motion, and not moving for too long and required a reclined position for relief, not standing or laying flat, and lasted for at least two doses of OTC migraine medicine. I now know that is far beyond what the definition of migraine states and have no idea what those are. About a year and a half ago, I suffered from more typical migraine type pain, but all over and two to four times daily, which meant I was overdoing it on medicine since they usually took one and a half to two full doses of OTC migraine meds to beat. This lasted almost exactly three months, so far no relapse, but now almost every headache I get lasts until medicated and takes two or more doses at the intervals on tge instructions. Most of these are not migraines, they are mild to moderate and impact my forehead, temples, neck, and vision centers on both sides of my head and are however accompanied by sensitivity to light, sound, hot and cold, and leaning over. I have searched for the combination of symptoms for all three of my worst headache types and have never been able to find a match.

This medication has helped relieve the pain to tolerable levels. I get all my medical care thru the VA health care system. I have moved regions and have a new Primary care team. Long story short, after requesting a new PCM, they changed my medications. They lowered the tramadol to once per day and put me on Diclofenac (twice daily). I was told that I do not have any reason to take the medications that worked before. The doctor wrote up that there was no need for this and the last MRI, 2016, showed this. I asked for another MRI and had one on Feb 1, 2018. I have about 6 MRIs that all show DDD. The last two MRIs do show the issues with my T-spine. I am happy to share my MRIs with the images to any professional that would give their opinion. I now have to deal with elevated pain levels that interfere with my daily life and happiness. I am not seeking narcotics. I would love to be pain free and off all medications. I understand that tramadol has been reclassified.

I have been dealing with this for 20 years since having my accident in the military.

There is a newer procedure out of Phoenix that they cut the nerve that is causing the issue instead of injections and burning. The medication change is probably due to the back lash of public outcry of overmedicating people with pain killers. Sadly, the ones who the treatments help also suffer in the mess. Currently the VA has me trying Psycotherapy with a psychiatrist to try mental stimuli to divert the pain. Seriously doubt it, but since I have tried everything else I figured this would be another check in the box. My situation is getting worse and sadly there is no cure as of yet. I have been to several orthopedic surgeons outside of VA and they say the same thing as VA. Only ones who suffer with it understand the quality of life issues. Keep going and find new joys in life.

I took the 1.5 just for 3 days BEFORE I seen the new doctor. Yes you're correct I shouldn't have done that to begin with but like I said I was having an MS relapse and I wasn't thinking clearly at that time, that's why I explain to the doctor why I did what I did because I didn't know they would change my meds around and I've taken my meds as directed since I left his office. The (Don't Understand) headline is why they would let me leave the office knowing that I was going to be behind in my pill count to begin with. I have never told a Dr what kind of medicine to prescribe me because you're right that's not my job it's there's! Oh I do have someone making sure I'm taking all my meds correctly now because living with MS is pretty difficult but I'm doing a much better than I was a month and a half ago that's for sure and that's because of all the support I get through my MS Society friends and my Bible study group which I do every night. Trust me I'm not trying to put the blame on any of the doctors or anything I'm just trying to understand why they would do that to begin with, that's all!!

You had to have realized the difference between the prescription or box of 50 mcg patches to ones that say 25 mcg. You had to have noticed the difference in colors of the oxycodone tablets. 15 mg are green, 10 mg are pinkish.\nThose things should have made you question if the meds and doses changed and made you read the labels at the very least, especially since they told you they weren't going to continue to treat you after that.\nThe new doctor isn't going to make up the difference you got from the previous doctor, but he is going to expect the meds he gives you to last 30 days or 28 days, however his office schedules appts for patients.\nWhat I am trying to get you and anyone else who might read this to understand is that it is OUR responsibility each month to make sure we read the labels and make sure we are only taking what the doctor currently tells us to take, otherwise, we can loose any access to pain medications permanently.\nI don't wish you ill will, and I hope you can cut back on the remaining oxycodone to make up the difference so you can make them last the 30 days.\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 1 year ago\nMan, I wish I would actually talk to you!

Background: About 10 mos ago while playing volleyball, I dove for the ball and my leg was in front of me and jammed while the rest of my body followed and kind of crunched together. Immediately I had an excruciating, sharp pain in my lowest back, near the tailbone- that pain where you almost pass out. I could not walk- my left leg just gave out. My friends carried me to the playground and I hung from the monkey bars while they pulled on my legs. Whatever slipped out, seemed to slip back in and it was nearly instant relief. It still ached, but it was completely fine by the next day.\nThen 2 days ago, I was playing and I felt a twinge on my left side in the same place but there was no dive or moment I can pinpoint- it just started to hurt gradually and the pain spread to the rest of my lower back. I stopped playing and went swimming, hoping that would help, but by the time I got home, I could barely walk. The pain is unbearable and I can't bend over at all or sit or stand or do anything- even lying on the floor is uncomfortable. I can only lie on my side with a pillow in between my knees. I've done nothing but stay in bed for two days. I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow and the pain has gotten slightly better, but it still constant and intense. I can't sleep and I have terrible reactions to pain meds so I have minimal relief options other than NSAIDs and xanex.\nHere's the reason I'm posting: The pain still feels MOSTLY on my left side, very lower back, but there is no shooting pain down my leg, and only moderate hip tightness. The strange thing that I can't seem to find anything about is this weird thing that happens when walking- the point where my left foot starts to leave the ground, I immediately get this sharp, acute pain in my left back and near by tailbone. I feel something shift/slip near by tailbone and left side of my lower back. It's such a creepy, strange feeling- something should not be moving or sliding around. Pain does not shoot up my leg- as soon as that foot leaves the ground, it triggers pain like pressing a button and I want to collapse, the pain is so sharp and intense. I can't find anything online about this- everything talks about sacroiliac hip/sciatic nerve pain, but I have no pain down my leg and it's closer to my tailbone than my hip. Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this.

I have seen a total of 13 doctor's; general doctor's, spine surgeons, hip surgeons, pain management doctor, nerologists, and rhematologists. I have been partially diagnosed with random issues that aren't adding up to anything. I have fibromyalgia, uneven hips, scoliosis from the uneven hips, and a labral tear in my left hip. I was told at one point that I was over weight which is causing the pain, and to get on a bike to lose weight, I was then told by the next doctor if I get on a bike it would get significantly worse. I try to workout or exercise by walking, running, yoga, and basic weight lifting, all of these cause more pain. I can barely walk the day after working out and I don't even push myself that hard.\nI am having the worst pain in my lower back and right hip. On my worst days my pain is a 9 and I can't move, I have numbness and tingling down my legs. My right leg has nerve pain from my groin all the way down to the top of my foot. I have most recently seen a hip surgeon who is refusing to fix the tear in my hip because he isn't sure that is what's causing all of this pain. He is saying my case is too complicated. He just gave me an injection in my left hip which was supposed to numb it. It is creating more pain in my lower back making it more difficult to walk.\nI am tired of dealing with all of this pain, I have taken every type of anti inflammatory, gel rub anti inflammatory, and physical therapy for 2 years. I am currently taking tramadol at a low dose, which is barely getting rid of the pain. I have had xrays, MRI's, MRI's with contrast, and ultra sounds.

I used to snow \"ski longly\" for many years & suspect this kicked off eventual development of my Osteoarthritis & Stenosis.\n\nLike most others who have replied, I too experience similar pain to your's and accompanying disability. I also agree you should never give up.\n\nI've spent the last 3 years consulting with doctors, many of whom astound me with their lack of understanding as to how to deal with the problem, yet always have some invasive procedure they think will work. 6 months I finally had surgery on L4/L5 that left me in worse shape than before surgery.\n\nNow, I have accepted a more unconventional approach is what's needed. I believe when one problem withinin the muscular skeletal system goes out of kilter, it causes additional problems, particularly in the back, hips, groin and leg/s. A Physiologist recommended I try taking one problem at a time and patiently work through this with yoga, massage and acupuncture. In my case, a weakened right leg due to a compressed nerve for which I had the surgery to fix, needs an orthodox brace and exercises to rebuild its strength. I'm pretty sure most of my pain and disability results from my leg's inability to land properly. So, the orthotic device is designed to stablize the leg while I exercise it to strengthen it. The best \"doctoring\" I ever had was administered by a masseuse. She helped me feel from my leg up, all the muscles & nerves that contribute to my pain. It was with this self knowledge that I began to adopt a strategy for correction, though I know I need to be patient & persistent. The acupuncture is for pain management (I hope). In any event, no one knows the mechanics that results in my pain better than me.

Your only solution would really be a Fentanyl transdermal patch, at least that is my guess. Those will definitely help your pain but they are dangerous and there are a number of ways that you can overdose using them such as applying heat to them accidentally, or breaking the portion that contains the fentanyl and again overdosing. You of course will need a pain specialist to prescribe them and to monitor your usage. You might also consider the newest type of Spinal Cord Stimulator which use a higher frequency current to block the pain signals. I am very close to using one of them because I have become too tolerant to opiods but am scared of the complications that might arise from the implantation of the spinal cord leads and the portion of the device that is implanted in your epidural space. Good luck, I understand your situation and hope you find some solution!!\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nI have to give you some information that you seem not to have received. Almost everyone receiving significant doses of Opiods are going to experience tolerance. Your body first will no longer experience the typical narcotic effects of the drug but you will still experience the reduced pain. But then you will begin to experience less and less of the beneficial effects of reduced pain. I am very close to the point where the Opiods are no longer providing much pain relief and will have to try a spinal cord stimulator. That is really my only option due to some of the issues with my failed back surgery syndrome. So I wish you well but want to warn you that your medication is not an extremely long term solution and you need to begin investigating your options. For many people radio nerve ablation (or using radiofrequency nerve ablation to burn the nerve so that it does not work for a year or two is a solution) for me that is not an option due to the issues with a failed back surgery fusion.

Pain is so subjective and those who belittle it are medical bullies how dare they! I laid down to sleep about 1230 last night and 215 this morning I woke with 9 or 10 pain. I literally wanted to die. So for someone to tell me I don’t know what pain is is insulting. By the way I’ve had back hip shoulder sinus ( after osteomyelitis) and various other surgeries So I know of what I speak when comes to pain. But I never try to belittle other people’s pain That would show a lack of respect. Also have the gift of rheumatoid arthritis which after 4 years of different meds still not under control. But all you can do is get through each hour then get through day One at a time. Pray every night for those in pain to have a good tomorrow.\n1\nReply\ntwistedtime\nover 2 years ago\nThanks for having my back!

I hope your pain is better, or will get better. I can empathize with being helpless or wanting it to just end. I hope you have a support system that can help your through all of this.\nThe original \"9 out of 10\" poster is just being a bully. Everyone has different levels of pain tolerance. Just because you can't handle certain pain and have a small pain tolerance it doesn't mean that mine is the same as yours. I was walking in San Francisco and was hit by a car going about 25 miles per hour and I wasn't even in this much pain, so you have no right to tell me to suck it up and not be melodramatic. I have been through a great deal of pain in my life and I am 24 years old! I shouldn't be in any pain at all. I should be healthy, but there's too many people like you out there who see my age, height, race, and sex and think I am perfectly fine and faking it! I suggest you take your negative attitude and go away. There is no need for people with your comments on here, and I don't see how this makes you feel any better about yourself. Go get yourself fixed and try to be nicer to people, please.\n"},{"author":"dm1954dl","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Constant pain for 3 years- No doctor is helping","resp_content":"Hey I don't know if your still following this or not but I thought Id share what I did. I am bipolar along with firbermialgia and have been on meds for about 20yrs. My shrink is the one that originally put me on gabapentin for pain. I didn't know much about it. The one thing I learned is that it is for seizures. The amount she ordered for me was what worked. I have never heard of anyone having as much as she gave me ( for someone without seizures.) It was 900 mgs 3 x pd. Yeah that's alot. It improved my mood as well as my pain. It's not a suggestion that most would follow but if its the only thing that works than what other choices do you have. I was on it that way for about 10 yrs. I have slowly weaned myself off it as I am doing very slowly with the others that I am on. The meds have been replaced with a moderate amount of exercise daily. I mean moderate. 30 mins or so of just walking. Bicycling etc. So whatever you get out of this I hope it helps.

I was prescribed and have been using various strengths of slow and instant release Morphine and Gabapenten for pain and nerve damage, as well as over-the-counter pain meds, Zopiclone for insomnia, Atacand to assist in lowering the upper blood pressure level, Rosuvastatin for colesteral and Wellbutrin for anxiety.\n\nThis past weekend I was volunteering at a local event where various companies set up booths to advertise, promote and sell some of their products. One of the booths was set up by a company called \"Twisted Extracts\" who's main product is CBD cannabis oil and other CBD products. A few years ago I was referred to a Physical Medicine specialist who, after a thorough workup, prescribed medical cannabis for pain management and sleep but I have never used the prescription as I had tried recreational marijuana before and thought that I would have the same experience with the medical type. I didn't realize it until someone explained the difference between medical and recreational marijuana, and I didn't want the feeling of being high all the time.\n\nAnyway, I purchased some CBD gummies and something called Twisted Extracts Cara-Melts which is just another type of CBD candy.

Let me go back to when I was about 12 to 13. I know I was still in middle school. My dad and I were out shopping and my dad grabbed my neck to try to scare me, but he notice that my spine connect to my neck was very large. My godmothers husband is a chiropractor, so my dad decided to go get x-rays done. He told me that my spine is completely straight. Didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t in pain at all at the time.\n\nFast forward to about 15, I started getting muscle spasms regularly. To the point, at the end of the day I’m crying alone in my room. Not letting anyone know how much pain I am. Over the years until about 17, it was just annoying and occasional would be in bed crying. When I got about 17, I would crying every night. Losing sleep, had to be on the phone or watching some sort of movie I have watched over and over again to try to at least ease it.\n\nAround that time or at 18, I went to the doctor and I got prescribed ibuprofen because they believed it was period pain. So I took that, didn’t help much unless I was super distracted and only during the day. But at night time, completely different ball field. I took so much ibuprofen over the next two to three years. I started pooping blood. So I went to urgent care and they prescribed tramadol which made me feel like I just took a sugar tablet.\n\nAnd then went back to annoying and coming back occasionally. So when i was late 22, it all started coming back. Taking naproxen and using the heating pad, shower or bath, (which I have done both of those the whole time) and that helped to get me to sleep for awhile.\n\nNow for the past nine to six months, I will have to fight back tears almost every night because I feel like I am baby for crying. I try all the things I usually do, but to no avail. During the day, it feels like it needs to be cracked constantly. I will have relief for a few minutes and then back to where we started. So, now I’m stilling here at 3 in the morning. I can’t get comfortable, and I just want to cry. I just wat to know if I am just crazy, overrating, or what to do? I just feel like no one believes the extent of what pain I am in. I try to hide as much as I can.

Also be careful taking magnesium within two hours of other medications as it may bind to other medications making them less effective.\n\nLow vitamin D levels can trigger a host of medical issues so keep up with the supplements, monitor his levels, get some sun on his skin, and incorporate vitamin D rich foods in his diet.\n\nIf he needs support dealing with all his medical issues, and who wouldn't struggle given all he's going through, consult a therapist. Some are quite resourceful in many areas, not just mental health.\n\nI hope you find some answers and he gets pain relief soon.\n"},{"author":"oliver1987","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Daily headaches","resp_content":"I also get migraines multiday.

Start with your primary doctor, then he/she may refer you to a specialist such as a neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon, or pain management specialist.\n\nIf you don't have a primary doctor, then go to a walk-in urgent care clinic.

If it is something serious causing your symptoms you will have to see a specialist.\n\nFor temporary relief, you can try over the counter pain medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxin or aspirin. Just be sure to take only the recommended dose. You can also try taking a warm shower focusing the water on you back, then use an ice pack for 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off.

Now, mine started out as a back ache here, and a back ache there, and mine just got progressively worse and now I need surgery to correct it.\n\nThe thing is, these are degenerative processes of of the spine, and they can be inherited, meaning that it runs in the family, as in my case. Now, with that being said, you usually won't get these until you're around 50-70 years of age or so, and as active as you are, I don't think you're in that category, however anything is possible. With that being said, since mine is inherited, mine was accelerated and I started having symptoms at 37 years of age. I am now 42.\n\nYou stated in the symptoms that sometimes the pain spreads to your ribs. Do you find it hard to take a deep breath or have issues with swallowing. I ask this because with me, my thoracic joint at C8-T1 acts up, and when it does, I have issues with swallowing, I feel like food is going down while air is trying to go up, and I have issues catching my breath.\n\nI found out that I can relieve this by standing in a doorway, putting a pillow between my back and one side of the doorway, and just push until I hear or feel it pop. within 30 seconds it's like it never happened. This works quite well for me, and it may help you get yours under control if it is the thoracic. Usually I put the pillow mid back first and I pop it, then I drop the pillow lower and I pop that one, and it disappears.\n\nNow, like the previous post suggested, see your primary care doctor, describe the symptoms as you did here, and they'll do an x-ray or mri of your spine. From there they're going to start you on stronger pain meds and possibly steroid injections. Then they will start you with a chiropractor, Physical therapy, or both. If you still have the issues, then they will probably put you in surgery to correct it, as in my case.\n\nA sure fire way to find out if it is your thoracic joint or not, is to eat Roman noodles, macaroni, or some other pasta. Those foods usually cause my thoracic to act up and go crazy. I feel like I'm choking when I do this, so use extreme caution. When I had my upper respiratory infection, they found out that I had a thoracic joint that was degenerated as well.\n\nThese are my symptoms and this is how I get around them until I have surgery on my back. But, I would strongly recommend trying to pop your back first as I described. If the pain and other symptoms go away, then you could have spinal issues that will need to be addressed by your primary doctor.\n1\n"},{"author":"mefrecruiting10000560600","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Severe back pain help?","resp_content":"Forget Web MD see a proffessional!\n\n\n<a href=\" https://khohealth.com/shin-splints-from-walking-and-what-to-do-about-them/ Splints Walking</a>\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/51735/severe-back-pain-help"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Broke my hand, two months later","post_content":"Two months ago, I broke two bones in my hand, \"small finger, metacarpal base\" and my ring finger, about 2cm from my wrist.

They estimated him to die 2 months ago but he is still doing pretty well. When he first went on hospice he was on low dose oxycodone and low morphine. As his pain got worse they took him completely off the oxycodone and kept raising the mg on his morphine till he is now on 100mg tablets and liquid morphine. The morphine is not enough he is still in bad pain in his private areas. They raised his mg so fast (and it still not working) that he really doesn't have any further to go except getting it in a IV which of course they want him in the hospice home. (I believe they thought he would be dead now so they just kept giving more morphine and his still not comfortable as he should be). I cannot understand why they raised the morphine so much so quick without trying to up the mg on his oxy. Now that it is 2 months past his death date and he is still trying to walk around the house and enjoy what he can, they added methadone to his morphine regimen. Since then he is confused and cannot swallow properly. My question is, how can taking methadone (that is suppose to block opiods) and strong morphine help with his pain?

Pain Management coming to end","resp_content":"That is insane. I'm disabled with multiple neurological conditions and excruciating chronic pain. Five years ago I had to stop all painkillers as a result of emergency surgery. I woke up after being in medically induced coma because I went into withdrawal and was moving around so much that all the tubes going in and out of me were being pulled out. I have no memory from the time I was in an ambulance to they started to bring me out of the coma.\nI also had a problem with my health insurance stopping one of my pain meds, and I went through a horrible withdrawal, until my doctor got them to reinstate it.\n\nHere's what I have done while in similar situations as you. I left my pain doctor and joined ProHealth Integrative Pain & Neurology Dept. ProHealth is now my Neurologist and a team that covers every aspect of pain. They have enough staff to fight Medicare and my secondary insurance company. Between their office and my PC they get them to cover all my pain meds, even though they exceed the maximum dosage.\n\nAlso, I learned to use meditation to help reduce pain. Two years ago I met with their palliative care doctor. She prescribed Medical Marijuana for peripheral neuropathies that no pills helped. I can't believe what a difference MM has made. I used to wear 3 Lidocaine patches on my feet every night. Once the Dispensary got the right products and dosages for me, I have only had to use the Lidocaine patches 3 nights!!!\n\nI hope this is of some help. You cannot just stop taking pain meds without withdrawal, and then all your pain returns. Is there a large healthcare group that you can go to? They should be able to help and get authorization for pain meds, while a small practice may not have the time to fight for you.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can try to help you with. Things like this really piss off my doctors. Each patient is different. They start fighting by telling the insurance companies that they prescribed what I need. My PC blasted them on the phone, while I was there. He asked if the person he spoke to was a doctor. No he wasn't. Then my PC let him have it - he's been my doctor for over 25 years, you're not a doctor, you have no right to change any of his prescriptions, and if they refuse, I will have very serious problems and it's on your shoulders and you'll have some serious problems if you don't approve it right now.

I also had a knee replacement in 2014 which almost cost me my life.\nI am skeptical of having another knee replacement on right knee because last operating I lost over 4 pints of blood. In 2014 we all know they changed the law on scheduling of certain medications. (They should have left Norco alone, You cannot shoot it nor snort it) I see where they say our nation has an opioid problem but honestly that was more when they came out with time released oxycodone (Oxycotin) and more . So now I have what they call a bakers cyst behind knee replacement and having to decide whether to have another knee replacement or what. They cannot or rather refuse to even touch my back, I have mass amounts of bone deterioration.\nPain Management Physicians around here like to play God, They want you to beg even though I have about 10,000 pages of MRI's CT's, DVD's reports.

That are forced to reduce their bona fide pain patients meds that help them and increase their quality of life & function.\nIt isn’t right for the gov to target PM docs. I do think that a LOT of chronic pain patients are being under treated for pain, myself included.\nMy new doctor (who is more affordable & closer[I have no insurance]) cut my meds by 25% on my first visit 4 months ago & did it to all his patients across the board, with no medical explanation whatsoever. I am not even on a high dose or a potent medication, & my most recent MRI showed my discs have gotten worse, with new tears & bulges & yet, I never asked for an increase in either strength or dosage.\nI have been extremely conservative in my use of opioids, and have never abused or diverted them & never will.\n\nI took the absolute lowest dose of the least potent opioid that reduces my pain by about 50%.....enough for me to function, sleep, cook, care for my kids & husband, work part time, etc. I was stable on it for 9 years, and was doing fine. I don’t expect to be 100% pain free, because I do not think that is realistic or ideal.\n\nBut at my previous dose, it provided enough relief to live somewhat productively. Now, however, I am in severe pain at level 7 for several hours daily. It has drastically impacted my life for the last 4 months & I feel like I am a burden on my family.

And I KNOW it, because it has worked for almost a decade without losing efficacy.\n\nI don’t know why 1 little pill makes so much difference, but it really DOES. It is literally the difference from having a functional, mostly fulfilling life & being in intractable pain for 4 hours of every day wondering why life is worth living.\n\nThat begins to take a toll on a person suffering daily.\n\nI refuse to do anything illegal so I will never buy anything off the streets, but mark my words.....there will be a tsunami of suicides from pain patients flooding this country.\n\nA person can only take so much uncontrolled physical pain for so long before they eventually succumb to the only relief they can get, which is death.\n\nI hope the doctors & opioidphobe gov realizes this.\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/7045/dealing-with-pain-and-new-laws"},{"post":{"author":"annakim1980","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"A good resource with useful articles which I found when I suffered from back pain","post_content":"I had back pain and wanted to solve this problem from home. I found this resource, I studied several articles about the pain that I had. I applied few tips from those articles and in a while I felt better.\n\nHere are some tips from this site:\nExercise: Regular exercise not only helps to build strength and endurance, it also helps keep your weight under control which can help prevent back pain. Most experts agree that low-impact aerobic exercises are the best because these activities avoid straining or jerking the back. Exercises that help strengthen the back and abdominal muscles, core-strengthening exercises, will help protect your back. Flexibility exercises, targeting the flexibility in your upper legs and hips may be beneficial also to reduce the potential for back pain. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional before beginning any exercise program.\nStop Smoking: Back pain occurs at a significantly higher rate among smokers compared to non-smokers of the same weight, height, and age.\nMaintain a healthy weight: Being overweight also increases your risk of developing back pain. The more overweight you are, the greater your risk of having pain in your back.\nMaintain good posture when standing: Keep your pelvis position neutral. To do this, keep your back straight with your head facing forward. Balance your weight equally on both feet, with your legs straight.\nMaintain good posture when sitting: To reduce your risk of back pain, your seat or chair should have adequate support for your low back, armrests and ideally, it should be able to swivel if you are working. When you are sitting, keep your knees and hips level and your feet flat on the floor. If your feet don't rest on the floor, use a small footrest or footstool to prevent back pain. Ideally, you should be able to sit straight up with good support in the \"small\" of your back. (the lumbar spine area). When you use a keyboard, your forearms should be horizontal with your elbows at right angles.\nLift properly: The key to preventing back pain when lifting is to lift with your legs, not your back. Keep your back straight, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place one foot slightly in front of the other to keep your balance and bend from your knees, not from your waist. Hold the object close to your body, maintain your back as straight as possible and tighten your abdominal muscles. This will pull your pelvis in. Remember to not straighten your legs before you lift. If you do, your back will be forced to do most of the lifting. Never lift and turn or twist at the same time. If the load is too heavy, prevent back pain by getting help. While lifting, keep your eyes focused straight ahead. Don't look up or down. This will keep your neck in a straight line with your spine and prevent back strain and back pain.\nMove objects correctly: It's is easier on your back to push objects than to pull them across the floor.\nWear the proper shoes: High heels put the strain on your back. Shoes with no heel are better for preventing back pain.\nDrive and ride correctly: To prevent back pain when travelling, make sure to have proper support for your back. Make sure the rear-view mirrors are positioned correctly so you can avoid twisting. The pedals should be squarely under your feet. If you are travelling long distances, take frequent breaks to get out of the vehicle and walk around to avoid back fatigue and back pain.\nRest right: The how to prevent back pain formula may be connected to how and where you sleep. The mattress on your bed should be able to support the weight of your buttocks and shoulders while keeping your spine straight. Keep a pillow under your head, but it should not force your neck into a sharp angle, which can cause upper back pain.\n\nRead more in this article: https://spinehealthlife.com/conditions/back-pain/back-pain-treatment","like_count":"0","tags":["Neck Pain","Back Pain"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/50295/a-good-resource-with-useful-articles-which-i-found-when-i-suffered-from-back-pain"},{"post":{"author":"pgb205","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Left Edge of foot pain+knee clicking","post_content":"started getting pain in the left edge of my left foot combined with clicking in my left knee.

There are some good meds that will help you get off the meds and the insurance has to pay for it. After that I hope you can get a doctor who fixed or finds the trigger and works on that. I have been on a escalation trend of stronger and more of these meds since a injury in 1992. At some point I know I will have to stop but then I will be done working, driving and enjoying life.

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).\nIn the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.\nI’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.\nShe referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.\nI went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks. He prescribed me a proton pump inhibitor, because in the last few months I’ve seen my conditions improve on/off with these (not sure if they’ve actually helped or not).\nAt this point, I’m just not sure where to turn. Seems I have a lot of the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (I also urinate frequently and have anxiety/depression over the situation), but I’m not convinced the chest pain is from that because for one I’m male (mostly females get Fibro), and secondly from what I’ve seen chest/armpit pain doesn’t normally line up with the normal Fibro pain spots.\nIf anyone has any ideas what may be going on here, I’d love to hear them. I’m going to follow up with my PCP once I get my biopsy results, but want to make sure it’s a productive conversation to move things forward. Thanks so much for reading, and good luck to everyone!

I went home and told my peoples what happened but of course, I knew what answer I was going to get. My mom doesn't have enough money to send me to the hospital for treatment. Now, after two months of walking on my bad knee ALOT, I can't do simple home workouts with feeling a pain and I can crack my knee whenever I please. When I crack it, I hold my foot with my other foot and rotate towards the left. Doing this helps random tightness I feel from here and there. The crack is louder than a pen dropping in a quiet room.\n\nBut anyways, I was wondering what should I do? Since I obviously don't have money for medical attention (also, no insurance), should I invest in a knee brace? and if so, what kind? Tell me everything. I really need to help my knee before it goes too bad. A teen with a knee of a 50 year old will only hinder my future.

I don't even know where to start or how to handle the situation. I started getting migraines at 27 (I'm 45 now). I've tried more preventative/abortive medications than I can name, had at least 20 MRI and CT scans, and I have been seen by 4 neurologists. The last one told me that I had \"terminal migraines\", and the only treatment he would consider was Botox. If I hadn't had Bell's Palsy in the right side of my face in 2008, I might have considered it. I was lucky with Bell's and didn't have any obvious residual paralysis after it subsided. I was prescribed Fioricet by my PCM, and had good success with it, but my PCM finally got to the point where he started refusing to fill it. I have always been dead-set against going to pain management because of the stigma. It was my last resort. I finally broke down a couple of years ago and asked for the referral. I've been at the same clinic the entire time, on the same medication, and same dose. I take both an immediate release and extended release of Nucynta. My records at this clinic are spotless...I have never violated protocol in any way. The problem started when the manufacturing plant for the ER Nucynta was destroyed in the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. Another company bought the right to manufacture the ER, but it's taken 3 months for the pharmacy to get them back in stock because the manufacturer is only allowed to produced a specific amount of pills at a time. Starting in mid-Jan, my pain provider switched me to immediate release and an ER version of hydrocodone. It didn't work well for me, so I asked her last month to drop the hydrocodone and go back to the immediate release Nucynta until the pharmacy could restock the ER. At my appointment this morning, I was told that my drug screen from the month I was on hydrocodone (Feb) tested positive for oxycodone. I realize most people, my provider included won't believe me, but I did not take any oxycodone. I didn't take any drug from another person, OTC or otherwise. She told me it was supposed to be a written infraction, but only put down a verbal. If I had violated protocol, I wouldn't complain, but I. Did. Not. Do. This. I don't know what to do or if there is anything I can do to get this removed from my records. I think that the circumstances speak for themselves...it's an awfully big coincidence that my urine tested positive for oxycodone the same month that I was switched to hydrocodone. Please, if anyone can give me any suggestions or advice, it is welcome. I spoke with my pharmacist this morning, and she was skeptical of the results as well.","like_count":"0","tags":["Migraines"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/46493/pain-clinic-protocol"},{"post":{"author":"oliver_jones","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Weird pains","post_content":"So it started about 5-6 years ago I constantly had problems with moving my knees.

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot).

They started me on Methadone pills. Worked great up to 2013. Had moved with my family to the Poconos in PA 2010. My wife and I divorced in 2015. In Oct 2015 I gave a guy a ride as a facor, and as he exited the car he said, \"I have no money for gas, but take this.....Then he tosses something in my lap. Door shuts, he's walking away, and I pick it up, and it said Suboxone. At that time I only heard of it, but didn't even know it was a controlled substance. So I took it home, looked it up on the internet, seen it may be helpful one day. I threw it in my jewelery box. In Jan, my prescription insurance changed from a $1.50 co-pay to a $100 copay. I couldn't afford to pay $200/mo on pain meds, so I said, I have to choose one or the other. I chose(in hindsight, didn't make sense), the opana IR instead of the ER...COme may, I couldn't make the 5 -10mg pills last 24 hours... I'd wake in the middle of the night with my L5/S1 disc killing me. SO, some nights I'd take a 6th pill and get back to sleep. I knew I'd be light at the end of the month, but thought I'd tough it out, instead of calling the doctor office, and then when I'd see him again, I'd simply request being put back on the opana ER....Well I was 4 days short on pills, and 2 days before seeing him, I remember I had that Suboxone film. I took it, and it did it's job. When I see him, he says, \"Lets take a urine test!\" He hadn't taken one from me in a year. Well, 2 days later, his nurse calls me, and says Dr Morganstein is dismissing you. \"Where'd you get the Suboxone from?\". I told her, \"from doing a guy a favor, and as he was leaving the car, he tossed into my lap. She said, \"well, that's illegal, and Dr Morganstein doesn't want anything to do with it.\". I asked, \"may I come in and explain to him the circumstances?. She said, \"No, once your dismissed, you cannot see him again... Phew.

Now, when I try to get a new Pain doc, they're going to request my records....A nurse from my insurance company advised me at that point, to explain what occurred.

My migraines are currently under control with a prescription NSAID and I haven't had cramps up until recently. I've had the Nexplanon for over a year and my periods have recently came back. My gyno said it is because the Nexplanon is releasing less hormones (still enough to protect from pregnancy and lots of pain) but I still have \"normal\" cramps, normal meaning what a usual female experiences. I'm mentioning this because my Neurologist has been trying to find out why I am having back pain for months, and he can't figure out why. I've been on nearly every NSAID and nerve pain medication, including Lyrica, with the pain not letting up. I was curious as to if it might be a sign of endometrosis? My gyno wants to check me for it, but hasn't given the go on it. I have all the symptoms, it just hasn't been confirmed. Could that be causing my back pain? Its a pain that's only really there when I lay down. It's a seizing pain, a tightening pain.

Combine that with an insurance company that doesn't want to really pay for anything and I'm pretty much left with PM. I've done years of PT, tried every over the counter or non-narcotic medicine they've suggested and the only thing that seems to work has been Oxycodone. I'm on 15 mg 4x/day.

I've never been anything less than candid with him and haven't had an issue until now. I seem to be developing a tolerance to the medicine and it's no longer as effective as it was.

I was going to call and talk to a nurse, but the office he is at was recently bought out by another company and the phone number I had for him no longer worked.

If you cannot touch your toes it usually means that your legs are stiff and since this has been from the age of 16, there are inherited traits that may be a large part of the problem.\n\nThe wrong thing to do is start looking at invasive or surgical options. If you saw three chiropractors who did not help, it does not mean you saw the right one. The same with therapy. I have rarely seen anyone in your age group require or succeed with medical/surgical options since motion is the problem and limiting it is going to make the problem worse.\n\nMost back problems start at the feet. Do you have flat feet and are they asymmetrical? If so, here is a good place to start; with an off the shelf insert. Second, find someone who is looking at you, and the way you move, rather than looking at your back. Find a chiropractor trained in ART, or iastm and some of the best are sports physicians who use an integrated approach.\n\nMy book Cheating Mother Nature, what you need to do to beat chronic pain may give you some insight into the problem and it is available through Amazon.com.\n\nBack problems can be in the back, in the shoulders, or can be an adaptive gait problem so treating back pain often does not work because it is usually a movement problem, with the back pain being the symptom.\n\nWish you luck\n"},{"author":"vallv","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Bad back pain!!

To try and help, I have seen physics, massage therapists, manual therapists and chiropractors all of which have told me a variety of things. Some say stretch, some say don't, some say exercise, some say don't. I have been seeing a manual therapist who has been doing IMS which seems to relieve the intensity of the pain but comes back a few days later. I have also only started taking ibuprofen so I can't tell for sure how much the IMS is working or not. I have only been doing the IMS for 5 weeks and I understand that chronic pain is a slow recovery process, but what I haven't receiced is a sure fire answer as to what the issue may be. I am an extremely active person, however with this injury, I am unable to do the things I want to do, and I am constantly thinking and worrying about the pain. I am willing to do anything to get it dealt with or to at least have an answer.

I have fibromalgia and arthritis. I have the pain from fibromyalgia for 25 years and arthritis pain 1 year. On Vicodin and later oxy. For 23 years I took 120 mg of Vicodin then oxy daily. 1 1/2 years ago I decided to get off oxy. The reason to get off was opoid induced constipation. First I could not go.Then when I was able to go it was hard as concrete. I flushed off and on for 3 hours, and it would not bend and go down the toilet. Finally I put on a pair of gloves pulled it out and put it in a zip lock bag and into the garbage. That scared the hell out of me. It was at that time I new I had to get off of opioids.For the last year and a half I have been trying to get off of oxy.First I tried cold turkey. That lasted 4 days and five nights. The stomach pain was more than I could take. So I told the clinic I want to cut me back each month so I could get off of this drug. Four months in a row same amount of mg of oxy. So the third month I cut myself back. When I went in 2 weeks ago I asked for clonidine. Clonidine is a highblood pressure med. The clinic gave me .1 mg clonidine. I knew from talking to pharmacy I needed .2 mg. Clinic said since I was taking 15 mg a day I should not have withdrawals. Wrong. Then he gave me 2 scripts oxy 112 pills each month. Plus Tramadol a non opoid pain killer. I went to another doctor and got the right amount of clonidine. Today is 13 days of no opoids. The clonidine was a big big help I could not hav e done it with out it. I asked the check in lady how many people come in daily she said 125-150 People a day 5 days a week. Plus she said they had two other clinics all so 125-150 a day. I did the math. $300x125 per day/5 days then add two more clinics doing the same. These pill mills are making a fortune. This guy that wrote the script tried to get me to do methadone when that did not work he threw out 2 more opoid pain killers. It was then that I realized this pill mill did not want me to get off off opioids. The tramdol is not a opoid BUT it goes to the same transmitters as the opoids. So I stand a good chance of addiction with Tramadol. The clinic never told me addiction Tramadol. I went on the net and found this out.\n\nWhen I am done with withdrawals I have a few natural pain killers to try. So only time will tell if I will stay clean.Good luck to all.

I LITERALLY peed myself on the way down... I crawled back up and changed.... I yelled at my kids AGAIN! And going down, I slipped on the SAME place!!))\n\nFast forward 4 years and I am still in pain! Due to bariatric surgery, I am not supposed to take NSAIDs! But being a type 1 diabetic with Hashimoto's (thyroid disease) I am predisposed to inflammation!! Tylenol alone doesn't touch my pain, so I go to a pain specialist. He has prescribed Lyrica and Norco 10/325, up to 5 a day. I know it sounds like a lot but that's what it takes!\n\nI have 3 sisters who are constantly making remarks and whenever a celeb passes away due to an overdose, I get the side eye and unsolicited remarks on how I should be trying 'healthier' options! I told them that this is MY option, at least until blue cross makes those options available as a benefit!! (ie. Chiropractic care, massage therapy, acupuncture, ETC..)\n\nAnyhoo.. I just wanted/NEEDED to rant along with you!! You're NOT alone! WE are NOT DIRTY ADDICTS (and I am NOT implying that anyone who does over dose is)!! Dependant...sure! But hell, if I miss a dose of my anti-anxiety med Effexor.. I will be tossing my cookies! Those are not considered 'controlled' or even 'addictive'! I wasn't even told how awful i would feel if I ever want to get off of it!! Another TERRIBLE drug that has EXTREME side effects, is Cipro (or ciprofloxacin)! I was prescribed for a UTI. I started getting twitchy and had shooting pains in my neck and my joints were so inflamed and PAINFULLLL. No warnings on those either.. Until I Google'd it!! Just saying.\n\nSorry, I got kinda off topic there but I feel slightly passionate about it! ;0)\n3\n"},{"author":"vbognar","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Ok, you do know Effexor is not exactly an anti anxiety med, right? It is just a new generation antidepressant. And it is very difficult to get off of. If you decide to get off of it, would like to suggest you might try to first switch to Pristiq 50Mg, if you have the withdrawal brain zaps it will lessen the intensity and less intense nausea also. It's the same drug as Effexor , but like more refined. Also please think twice before you take anything in the antipsychotic class of drugs even newer generation unless you need them to control psychosis, they have permanent side effects. I took abilify for 15 years and have a permanent movement disorder and difficulty controlling my anger. Abilify was given to me to help my antidepressant work better, and it did. But now I have to deal with the damage it has done. It is not a matter of IF you will get a movement disorder it is a matter of WHEN. - true for all antipsychotics. Sorry to rant but I feel very strongly about the damage that occurs and your Dr doesn't let you know the end result from these poisons and when it happens there is nothing the can do about it.

I was also happy to see that I am not alone in my thoughts about this Opioid Epidemic. I suffer from Crohns Disease and all the side effects that go with it. Arthritis, osteoporosis, anemia, skin problems, High blood pressure, long term use of Prednisone and its side effects. I have Fistulas and fissures due to Crohns, and I have 3 vertebrae that are fractured due to the medicines I take. I also had severe Kidney problems with stones blocking me completely and was in ICU for 3 days, had to go on Dialysis for a while. I too take pain killers, I take 100mg of Morphine sulfate extended release(every 12 hrs.) and 90 15mg. morphine sulfate imm. release for break through pain. My Dr. reduced the 15mg morphine from 100 to 90 because of pressure over the supposed Opioid epidemic, and Iam afraid it will continue. I try to tell primary Drs. that I don't get high or feel euphoric and that's why I take these, its been 7 years taking them and now my body is dependent on them. I go through incredibly bad reactions when I miss a dose, like a heroin addict. I take them because they keep me functioning, its part of my life which I would love to stop but never will be able. Its a quality of life issue, I am 58 yrs. old, what will I be dealing with in 10 more years (God willing). Not to poke fun, but I feel your pain. Lets not go quietly into the night.

I told my doctor I don't understand why they blame doctors...I've never heard of one writing a prescription for heroin.\nStatistics show opioid deaths are primarily from heroin laced with fentynal. I just lost my stepson in December from heroin, fentynal with a calotipine chaser . He had been in recovery 6 months. His supplier was his girlfriend who resided in a drug rehab facility. He was 47. The average age is about 38.\nRecently a woman reported that her boyfriend was using heroin again. She called his parole officer. He came and piss tested him. He had just done a dose of heroin. Damned if the test came back clean. We think the officer pissed for him. I think only blood test should be acceptable. As for us pissing in a cup...they should pay for it.\nTruth be told many of these people SELL there pain pills to buy heroin and meth. I know it for a fact. Doctors are so out of it that when we told one doctor his patient was snorting heroin while hospitalized he was astonished because he didn't know that it could be snorted.\nNow I saw in the Lima paper today the VA is bragging they cut opioid prescriptions by 40% for NON CANCER patients. Really? Veterans. I wouldn't brag about putting veterans in pain from battle injuries.\nBottom line, pain can make a person extremely angry. I venture to say when we are begging for relief it could get ugly.\nLet's just say these politicians need to talk to us.\n2\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/37582/opioid-epidemic-crisis-addiction-vs-dependency"},{"post":{"author":"aessvtjsma","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Fractured Tailbone","post_content":"Terrible lower back pain, numbness is front of left leg only since 12/5/17.

First started with some low back pain and some disc problems. Spinal stenosis. I have arthrititis through my body. Also signs of M.S. Being told 20 years ago I have it. My spinal tap won't show the rings. Other stuff in my spinal fluid like very high protein. Those problems I have to deal with when they come. The rings that show up in spinal fluid is because autoimmune problem won't let me fight inflammation anymore because of this in my spine. I had one pain specialist that fracture my spine in 4 places showing me these parts of my spine problems with these twists. Felt something in the 3rd twist. Percocet wore off and more pain I didn't want. Next pain specialist gave me an injection in buttock area. Doctor was interupted during this and forgot the second numbing shot. Felt like a 6 inch nail went in my poor crippled and hurting body severely stiffen and I learned tears can actually shoot out like bullets. NO more needles and no more steroids because I am diabetic.Steroids were messing with me so bad my PC doctor had to call them and said no more steroids. After that my orthodedic doctor found me another doctor. I had a really bad fall 3 years ago.Top of back foot stepping went completely under a mat. When my back foot let loose I went straight down into hard packed dirt. I was in wheelchair for 5 months. All the injuries were multiple lower fracture ribs and cartledge, hairline fracture in tibia, my spine went out like an accordin and when I hit it came back in. Torn meniscus in each knee and fluid in the one knee made a 2mm cyst go up to 78 mm and needed drained 4 times. Now it gets big and drain on it's own. Spine injury never stopped. Right arm was severely bruise as my right shoulder that can be painful. I have spinal stenosis in spine and neck also. Found out during this time I have scoliois at a number where 2 more numbers that it will need to be treated. Will know soon if the scoliosis was from fall, that can happen. Never felt it till after the fall. So where was I with pain control? My orthopedic was limited to percocet and I was taking ten mil. every 6 hours. Still screamed and cried alot and he sent me to pain specialist. Yea the one who is forgetful giving injections. He was trying differant meds and it was rather they wouldn't work or had a bad reaction. Doesn't matter what is going on you had to wait for your next appt for the month. I cried so much and call them after holding my spine over from pain balling my eyes out for four hours and office said wait till your appt. I had what the nurse call like phantom pain. I really actually had thoughts of using a chainsaw and cut my knees off and stepping in front of a moving car thinking it would stop the pain. It was horrible. I cried and moaned and up hours at night from the pain. This went on for 2 1/2 years. I don't know even how I even went through it. That doctor was putting me on meds that were not helping at very small doses because of this scare. This new doctor put me on 10 mil. of Opana 12 hour. I tell you what.....I had release of pain. It was sooooo like night and day. I do not know how I even did it for that long suffering like that. The medicine last for 8 hours not twelve. So four hours during sleep I can wake up with pain but I get through nights being I am laying down. Four hours during day can be brace or heating pad. I really don't mind that because so much of the pain was killed. Recently went to my orthopedic doctor and he said he seen things in my spine has been progressly getting worse last two years from tests I had . He said I needed surgery and then said BIG surgery. OK...I needed surgery on my knees and it would not be done because my sleep doctor stated I was to have no surgery unless it was no other choice that has to be done. I have sleep apnea and central sleep apnea where I stop breathing 98 time an hour. Brain won't tell me to breathe when sleeping. See surgeon on February first. IDK. Ortho doctor said I would end up in wheelchair. Then 2 years after the fall I was driving and stopped behind a car that was turning left and I looked in my rear view mirror and seeing this jeep vehicle coming real fast and as I turned my head to tell my husband this man hit us speeding and there was no skid marks. My husband and I had both grabbed our necks. My spinal stenosis was so bad and for an hour and half could feel things moving in my neck. It ended up disc hit and pinched nerve and knock disc and hit spinal cord and it bled a little bit. I never had pain in my neck. Just bothersome one time when talking to my son with my head turned. Now the breakthrough of pain with that is a differant pain I do not want. Yes I need surgery on a disc that moved. Not going to happen right now. Surgeon said if I start losing things dropped in hand or losing feeling surgery will have to be done right away or it will never get it back. It is not very good right now. Get brain attacks that is painful. Have 10 plus lesions. Neuro problems that go with that. I tell you what.........I pray that no one else has to go through this with this medication problem caused by other people. It is coming into this country. It was inhumane to let me suffer so bad. People that was dying from herione with Fentanyl made a choice, A very sick choice. I am not understanding it, A mother died here in our city at Childrens Hospital. Her child was very sick. Both parents used up in bathroom and mother died in there. A newspaper story where parents used up and both died upstairs and they were found a week later and their 6 month old baby was found dead in bassinet. Parents found pulled over somewhere OD or passed out with there children just sitting there. One guy in our city used and decided he felt so good he could speed in his car which caused a horrible crash where a little child was toss out of the car and was moved out of the car seat and rolled on the pavement. It is all sad and there is people going crazy now it seems for narcotics. Unfortunate people need medication. There has to be a line drawn on peoples conditions that show on their medical records. I would also say keep urine testing. It is pure inhumane what was happening to me.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/38373/what-gives-authorities-the-right-to-make-our-doctors-decisions-with-people-that-have-medical-records-of-problems"},{"post":{"author":"sandown","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Opiate addiction","post_content":"I have been in chronic pain for 25 years.

This is my first post and I am looking for some kindred folk who may have experienced what I am experiencing. I have had a dull ache between my shoulder blades (interscapular) for three months (since end of October), primarily on my dominant (right) side. I have taken very conservative treatment options (three visits to a physiotherapist in past three weeks and use of NSAIDs, such as Aleve on a sporadic basis) because I do not exhibit any of the warning (red flag) symptoms that should compel an immediate visit to a physician (no weakness or numbness, no fever, no swelling, no night sweats, no pain waking me at night, etc). Also, my physician is 25 miles away in my former hometown, which makes it a bit more difficult to make the trip. I did go to a walk-in clinic in early December, as this all seemed to start with a mild bronchitis which caused a lot of coughing and subsequent intercostal rib ache along with corresponding ache in the upper back. I thought that with the cough getting better the ache would go away soon after, and that physician confirmed that he thought this was what was causing the problem and \"not to worry\".\n\nFast forward another 7 weeks or so, and the ache is pretty much there all the time. It is not enough to stop me from working or doing every-day tasks, and is not affected by movement, but I'm always thinking about it. The characteristics of this discomfort are the following - dull ache just below the scapula and primarily on the right side; ache that sometimes goes into the scapula and can refer to the middle of the back (spine) at times; ache is generally unaffected by movement, though there is corresponding stiffness; corresponding ache in right shoulder (started about a month ago, and compounded by my stupid decision to go to a rock climbing gym with my son); sometimes the ache goes into the upper right arm above the elbow (this only started a couple of weeks ago).\n\nI find relief only with three things. 1. Moist heat (like the hot tub) is a saving grace; 2. Vigorous exercise; 3. Sleep. It is better when I am lying down, but pretty much there all the time when I am up and taking part in daily activities. I also do a fair amount of stretching and have done some yoga.\n\nMy physiotherapist, whom I have only started seeing three weeks ago thinks I have major muscle stress and trigger points, which might be the cause of the problem. He says my upper back is \"hard as a brick wall\" and says that this has been going on for so long that it could be another 4-6 months before it is finally better. I do have an office-type job where I spend a lot of time sitting in meetings and in front of a computer monitor. I have been trying to monitor posture and take regular breaks to walk around. My physiotherapist says there is better movement each time he sees me, but that the pain or ache is always the last thing to go. While I don't discount his professional opinion, and hope he is right (except for the lengthy healing process), I am wondering if I might have a nerve impingement thing going on (perhaps dorsal scapular syndrome or something like that), osteoarthritis, a disc problem, or something more ominous?!\n\nThe ache has not been getting worse, but is not really improving. However, some days it does feel improved (after the first visit to the physio, I felt good relief for about three days). I have not yet had x-ray or CAT scan, but will do that soon if there is no noticeable improvement.\n\nAny advice that you can offer is most appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/38356/dull-ache-between-shoulder-blades-for-three-months"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Yoga for back pain with fractured vertabrae","post_content":"If you have a cracked #1 lumbar vertabrae, not serious but not minor, is yoga okay and if so what kind?","like_count":"0","tags":["Back Pain"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/38340/yoga-for-back-pain-with-fractured-vertabrae"},{"post":{"author":"sabbathrayn","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Please help me, I'm scared","post_content":"Tuesday I first went to pain management, the doctor, again, treated me like I was lying about my pain.

We were like wrestling and I was trying to pin her down on the flour. She accidentally kicked me on the one side of my head. Yes, it was a bit hard but there was no mark, bleeding or even dizziness.\n\nHowever, the next morning, the one side of my neck was swollen and my shoulder was quite sore. I visited the chemist who said I ought to go see a doctor.\n\nSo, off to the doctor I went the next day. By then the swelling and pain was less but still present. My doctor informed me that it may just been because of the sudden movement of my head to the one side and gave me inflammation tablets. After 3 days of these it went away and I thought right, it was nothing.\n\nBut soon realized I was wrong. After about two months the swelling and pain came back and with a vengeance. So, back to the doctor I went. After quite some arguments, he sent me for X-rays but couldn't find anything out of place. I was them sent for acupuncture. This was a nightmare, the needles bend completely and afterwards the pain was worst, my neck actually made a big bulge. So, no more of that I said.\n\nI started taking ibuprofen which helps ease the pain but knew I couldn't stay on it forever. I requested a second opinion and was sent for an MRI which also showed no issue. Then I was sent for normal physiotherapy which did assist with the issue and for a long time everything seemed normal.\n\nYet, this was all about 4 years back and every now and then it would come back, I'd drink ibuprofen and it would go. The last time was about 8 months back and I thought, well, eventually it is gone.\n\nOnce again I was wrong. It returned yesterday and is worst that ever before.

I've had a similar problem for years and been through what you've been through...and frankly I'm tired of Ibuprofens or Tylenols. That's toxic with long term use.\n\nNow I have another issue compounding mine. I had breast cancer, had surgery and the radiation treatment for 6 weeks. I've been told can have long term impact of effecting the lymph nodes on that side. It probably effected the nerves as well. We have a lot of lymph nodes that can get blocked, but in my case the radiation cooked me so I'm sort of a mess on the inside although looking at me you would never know. My pain wraps around to my mid back from my right chest to almost the center of my back. Nobody knows the true cause. I had CT Scans done and nobody saw anything wrong. I think my job of standing all day for the last 14 years has also taken a toll and it's a culmination of everything now. I'm not big on narcotic medications but I have those for my worst nights so I can sleep since it's hard to get any real relief.\n\nTry this next step if you haven't already. I lay on my back and gently roll from side to side with my knees pulled in best that I can (I'm getting overweight and that's not helping my cause). I let my legs set on the sofa or coffee table to relax. Use some Gel ice packs help as well for about 15-20 or until they become warm from your body. I find myself dozing off. It is something so small, but it could help you. also deep breathing. I wish I could suggest something different but doctors don't know everything and we sometimes have to take matters into our own hands. I don't know about you, but my sleep is impacted and my overall wanting to jump out of my skin often happens. I'm short tempered, deprived of rest, depressed, no family support and not many friends to reach out to that care. If it wasn't for my work as a distraction, I have no idea what hole I'd find myself in.\n\nSo, try to stand with proper posture daily. Make that effort but be sure to sometimes relax your hips so they tip forward. Nobody will know you are doing that but it relieves the lower back and in turn the upper gets some relaxation.\n\nTry to stretch the area gently as well but you'll need to find something on the web that will get the area that's bothering you.

I can't take it anymore.\n\nI'm an Expat living in Japan. We have socialized health care, so I can go to a wide range of clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals for a hell of a lot lower price than if I were back in the States. But I feel like the service is terrible and the doctors more-a-less make me feel like they just want you to keep coming back for months and months, rather than fix the problem as quickly as possible.\n\nA year ago, upon waking up one morning, my neck was in extreme pain. Moving it, turning my head and pretty much doing anything was impossible without hurting. Spent a day or two on Ibuprofen and relaxing to see if it went away, but didn't. Pain stayed in my neck and then slowly continued down to my shoulder, and bicep. Throbbing, pulsing pain. Retreated back to shoulder and neck. Then back down the arm all the way to my hand/fingers (hand felt tingling, asleep).\n\nWent to a nearby clinic. Explained the amount of time this was going on and all the symptoms and pain(s). He took some x-rays and found out I basically had a compressed disk in my neck. And this is what was causing the pain. Was given some meds and told to rest. Not much more I could do as it would work itself out in time.\n\nWithin the next month, the right arm pain went away, but then switched to my left arm. Same pain, same progressive path of neck, shoulder, bicep, forearm. Go back to the same clinic. Told to do neck stretches and some other exercises at home. Didn't help. Meds didn't do anything. Pain remained. Tired of hearing generalities and basically making it sound simply as this is just the way it is.\n\nWent to hospital. This is 3rd month of pain. The neck issue is gone. But the pain I have is still this intense, non-stop throbbing, pulsing pain that feels like it's in my bones. It's not superficial. Whether I am laying down, sitting, standing, doing something or nothing at all, the throbbing pain is there 24/7. There are certain extremes of bending my arm in certain positions which does cause more pain, but honestly, as I've told every doctor, if I know that doing X hurts, at his point I am ok to just not do X. But the 24/7 from waking until sleeping constant, non-stop throbbing pain has consumed my thoughts, life and any ability to be happy for 1 minute.\n\nI was going to the hospital once a month for 7 months. The took X-rays and scans of various types. They said I have calcium deposits on both shoulders - left and right. And that THIS was the new cause of the pain I have. First doctor I saw at hospital gave the impression the calcium deposits will never go away so I'll always have this pain. Second doctor I saw there (filling in for first doctor) said they will go away with time, thus the pain will go away, too. Taking meds to help reduce them, for pain (just ibuprofen) and one other med to help build up something in the area to help. Pain kinda came and went.\n\nFinally he referred me to a physical therapist. But since leaving the hospital visits a few months ago, and going to physical therapy, the pain is back stronger than ever. Pulsing pain only in the right arm - shoulder to elbow. Physical therapy doesn't work at all. And their thinking there is the calcium deposits have no role in this pain, but that it's because of posture? Scratching my head over this comment.\n\nDoctor there finally gave me Tramcet, which helped for the first 1-2 weeks, but now that doesn't do anything at all.\n\nAnd now here I am. It's been 11 months since the start of this. I've been to 1 clinic, 1 hospital and 1 physical therapy place. 3-5 doctors in total. 5 different stories from each doctor. And the pain is worse then ever.\n\nI am at a total loss as to what to do. It's unbearable. This pain is my life. Sure I can go to work, go out, and do whatever I want. But the pain is always there. It's with me right now as I write this, and it makes me want to cry, get angry, yell at these doctors who insist I keep coming back and smiling as they give me ibuprofen as pain relief which has zero effect. When I mention if it's something requiring surgery or injections (when they told me about the calcium deposits), their reaction was like not even comprehending how surgery would be necessary.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Neck Pain","Physical Therapy","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"markdunck","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Pain Nightmare","resp_content":"As it is in your neck you really should be seeing a neurologist for this issue. General doctors are not really good for this sort of thing as you are experiencing. Physical therapy may or may not be a help to you.

I mean, after once a month hospital visits for 6-7-8 months, and being referred to physical therapy as a more finishing treatment, the physical therapist and doctor there laugh and think nothing the previous doctor did/ was doing was correct, so hey, no big deal if you wasted 6-7-8 months going there.

The pain management situation is currently in reaction mode, and we are being indoctrinated by the news and everyone that narcotics don't actually work for long term pain. A few of us have the unfortunate opportuninty to personally know differently, and are now being denied the medications which have proven to help for many years. I agree that narcotics need to be controlled, and their use monitored. But I believe most deaths credited to narcotics are due to illicit use by a sick society who no longer value life. I personally know multiple people who have responsibly managed their pain with prescription narcotics for decades, and thereby maintained some semblance of life not otherwise possible. Now that life is being withheld, because prescribing time proven affordable pain medication is no longer politically correct. Extremely expensive, less effective, and cognitive impairing replacements such as Gralize are being pushed for obvious profit reasons. Be aware that free samples in attractive packaging given by your doctor were supplied by the same pharmaceutical company which also provides the doctor with free personal perks, perverting their judgement of what is best for you the patient. Beyond this I cannot blame doctors for being wary of prescribing narcotics due to current interference of the DEA and our legal system into the doctor,'s practice, threatening him if he dares ignore their draconian effort to control them.\n"},{"author":"bamawilson1","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Yes, my uncle who has MS is wheel chair bound.

My really bad pain started around 11 years ago now when I say really bad I mean pain all over my body different parts worse then other at times .I have had pain In my ankle but the pain I have now is totally different . The right ankle pain is where all this started . I was seeing\nA arthritis doctor and physical therapist over the years and I was prescribed Mobic which worked for a little while then I was taking ultram then hydrocodone . Then because of the drug crisis gripping our nation well it's a heroin problem but that's a whole other subject I was told I was to find another doctor (a pain management doctor) to have the medication prescribed. Well the pain doctors I went\nTo were not willing to help me either after paying them 3 to 5 hundred for the first visit . So I took to the streets where I found what I needed but at a very hefty price . Also it made me feel like a drug addict . But it also took away the horrible pain I was feeling all over my\nBody and helped me have some kind of a normal\nLife , After working a 9 Hour day on my feet I just didn't want to walk another step . I would drive home and before I would even pull into driveway I\nWould start crying because I knew I was going have to stand up and walk and the pain was unbearable I would open the car door stand there holding onto door crying and saying it's only 30 steps to. The bed and that's where I would spend the rest of my night till I had to get up for\nwork the next day . If my son did not make me something to eat I just didn't eat , to much pain to\nGet out of bed to feed myself . One good thing is I lost 15 pounds over 5 months .so anyway I am still on pain medication from my friends. Not Cheap . I\nDon't go to a dark alley or street corner or go into a a home where there are guns being pointed at me and pit bulls guarding the front door as my co-worker has this picture in her mind . That's where she thinks I buy from . She watches to many music videos or crime shows .\nI go to work and some times I even cook dinner and do things around my home . I have somewhat of a normal life now but if I don't have the medication forget it I would not be able to work. It's a catch 22 sistuaton . I need to work to pay for my pills and I need pain pills to work so now if I could just get my\nCo-worker to understand all of this my time at my work place would be easier to show up to . I was just recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was given cymbalta . Don't feel any difference .\nMy co-worker tells me she is in pain to, which I totally belive ,but she is not doing anything about her pain she complains about her neck ,back and knees . I have recommended that she see a chiropractor or do physical therapy. Because she will not take pain medication she thinks that I should not and that my pain can't be all that bad or I would be out of work. She has no ideal how hard it is to get permanent disability. I also think that I need work just less time because I don't want to become useless or a shut in . Because of the pain I also have depression and no outside contact would be the worse thing for me .\nSo in closing if you have a co-worker who has confided in you please don't dismiss them or pick on them , show a little compassion and maybe it could help them to feel better . Don't talk about people behind thier backs either because they will find out and it only hurts both of the parties involved and sometimes all your other co- workers .

If you are paid for a service that you feel is a waste of your VALUABLE TIME - give them a refund..... What, wait, why do you feel that you are owed payment for a service that you DID NOT provide. I really think it's sad that there is only 1 service in our country that you pay for regardless of the quality or whether you even get what you paid for. I think that Dr's are no different than any other service we pay for and I would love to hold them accountable for their actions. Waitresses get more $ for better service, why can't we hold doctors accountable for their behavior. Their profession is the ONLY service that you have to pay full price for regardless of quality. I believe that if we held doctors to the same standards as a waitresses (it's sad that we can't) we would have better health care. However, in our society, doctors are the ONLY PROFESSION, that is paid full price by walking into the room. Sad but true!\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/31426/i-have-pain-all-over-my-body-and-my-co-workers-think-i-am-lying"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Unexplained Back Pain","post_content":"A little over a day ago I started experiencing discomfort in my sternum (like it needed to be cracked) since then I have developed pain in the base of my neck into my shoulders and mid back.

When I was in middle school (around age 12 almost 13) while trying to do a handstand for PE, I landed badly on my face (lol) and chest and some of my stomach area, and I fell sort of like a...scorpion landing, where my legs were in the air and curved toward my head. Basically I landed pretty badly and my body was curved awkwardly, and it was very hard to move afterwards. But I didn't want to tell my mom about it (she had breast cancer and i didn't want to be a burden) so I acted like everything was fine. I felt pain in my lower spine/back and the area around the lower spine was bruised and felt swollen. I guess I pulled something, fractured something, strained something, etc. I just tried to stay away from sports for a few weeks while still going to school and doing everything I can in PE class. After a few weeks it wasn't hurting as much anymore. When I pressed down on it, it still felt kind of bruised. I had a growth spurt when I was 11 -12, where I grew around 4.5 inches. After this injury, I grew two more inches from, I think, age 13-15/16. But I grew so slowly. VERY slowly. My older sister was around the same height as me at that age I got the injury, but after my injury, I started growing slowly. She, however, kept growing at a much faster rate, and is now two inches taller than me. I got this injury in 7th grade and only grew half an inch in 8th grade I think. She grew like two inches in 8th grade. She never had an injury. When I was little, everyone in my family thought I was going to grow taller than her. I also have longer feet than her. I was lactose intolerant as a child, though. But now I'm worried I stunted my growth from the injury. I did track and field when I was 11 - 12 years old. I stayed athletic in middle school. In high school, I did track and cross country. I was a very fast runner and was in the varsity team. However, since that injury, I noticed that my lower spine area felt more ... flexible? and whenever I stretch it, I hear and feel this spongy sound/feeling. I also feel like my posture is bad ever since. It also hurts to sit for a certain period of time. Anyways, my mom is 5'5'', dad is 5'9'', older sister is 5'6''. My sister grew a lot even after her growth spurt :( I'm worried that I stunted my growth from this injury. I'm also worried about my lower back because it bothered me on and off ever since. I did a lot of research about spinal injuries and disc herniation in growing preteens but all I find are articles I can't really read. My lower back does bother me occasionally but I don't know if it's all in my mind, since I left the injury untreated. Sorry for long read. Also.. would a specialist be able to tell me much in relation to stunted growth if I get it checked now? And if I actually did injure it pretty bad, would they be able to help much?

It took a couple of times for a real good effect but the relief is amazing. I may have to continue having the injections but it's worth it. This might be something you might want to look into.

As time goes on it becomes harder to get out of bed sometimes. And harder to find motivation to push through. The pain can sometimes start as an ache, other times its a throb and even get sharp. It can happen in both legs from ankle to knee. sometimes I can even track the pain as it moves up and down my legs. I haven't been able to find any sort of consistency between activity and the pain. I can do 500 miles on the snowmobile in a weekend and be fine. Other times I just wake up in pain. Tylenol and Ibuprofen can sometimes take the edge off but that's about it.

Always the same never any variation. I sharp stabbing pain through my left eye through my head and out the lower left part of my skull by the neck. Feels like a cold steel spike through my head.\n\nI recently am getting these \"Things\" I don't know what they are. I have lesions on my brain though why is a matter of debate. They are either MS or migraine lesions. Two different neuros two different opinions. But now that aside I am getting these attacks that last 5 days. The first happened October the 8th. Now it starts out as brain pain, I know that brain does not actually feel pain but for lack of a better term that is what I call it. It is very electrical in nature occurring in my hairline and forehead region. It is bilateral not one sided at all and not on the sides. It starts out with pain at a 7. Then over the next 3 days it builds in intensity to a 10. At day 4 and 5 there are surges of pain that are so far off the pain scale that I am literally incapable of thought when they occur. On day 6 it is just completely gone.\n\nNot only does it cause this electrical brain pain but the normal chronic pain I have also ramps up in intensity with it untill it also hits a 10. But it seems to only be the chronic pain along my spine that gets worse leaving my shoulder which has chronic pain alone. So then in November also on the 8th it starts up again. Knowing that I will not survive it a second time I go to the ER and I am admitted. I am given IV steroids at a high dose for MS. Day 2 a new neurologist enters the picture says that he thinks that it is a migraine, and now the steroids are tapered down and toradol is added. Something breaks it on day 3. It just ends and I go home. Now I had never stopped the steroids in the hospital because I was on so much they couldn't just stop. The reason the new neurologist did not think it was MS was because he had never heard of any one who had MS not showing that on a spinal tap. However The National MS Society has stated that some 5-10% of people with MS test negative.\n\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/Diagnosing-Tools/Cerebrospinal-Fluid-(CSF)\n\nSo here is the thing with it being a migraine the pain was electrical not stabbing, I did not have any sort of \"Premonition\", no over sensitivity to light or sound, no vomiting, no after headache and I never passed out from pain. These are all things that occur with my migraines. And it does not seem to fit the definition of stress or cluster headaches. I am not arguing for it being an MS attack, in fact I definitely do not want it to be one. It also does not sound familiar to people with MS, so there is that.\n\nI am waiting to find out how many months I will have to wait until I can see a new neurologist as when I called the Office that I want to go to they were telling me the end of February and I have to have my doctor set it up","like_count":"0","tags":["Headaches","Migraines"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32628/headache-related"},{"post":{"author":"masonb1997","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Pain in sternum area follow by gas","post_content":"I’m having very sharp flares of pain in my sternum area just at the diaphragm and the pain is followed by very extreme gas, and the pain ceases for a brief moment, then it comes back and I have gas again, the pain in my chest hurts very bad when I take deep breaths and only eases after release of gas.

I am about 30 pounds overweight\n\nEarly September this year my toddler daughter kicked me in the chest 2-3 times at the store when I was holding her. She kicked me around the middle and the middle sides of my chest. Also I think she kicked me in the upper middle and upper middle sides of my chest too. After a week My chest pain died down. After a a couple weeks my chest pain was gone.\nI went to urgent care one week after I was kicked in the chest. My chest was not hurting that much when I went in, but my head and neck was. The doctor diagnoses was: Strain of Muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, initial encounter. The Doctor told me my lymph nodes were causing pain on the right side of my face and head. My chin, right cheek, and right forehead (felt a little tingly and a little numb). Pain went a away after a few days when I was taking my medication and did what she told me to do (mentioned below in this paragraph). I can't breath out of my nose that well, so I breath out my mouth. A ENT doctor told me before I would need a operation to breath out my nose better. The urgent care doctor told me to put a pillow under my back up to my neck when I sleep. I did this and after a few days the major pain went a away. The pillow worked.\n\nThe doctor gave me a low dose muscle relaxer and a high dosage of Ibuprofen (800 mg every 8 hours). After the first day of taking Ibuprofen I had some tinnitus and some hearing problems (like my ear felt blocked for a few hours). After the second day of taking Ibuprofen I had non stop tinnitus for 6 days straight. I had a month and a half of blocked hearing and ear fullness/pressure in my left ear. A ENT doctor told me to have no extra salt, no soy and no msg in my diet. This diet did not help. When I started doing neck exercises (stretching) my ear went back to normal after 2 days and a lot of my head pain decreased. Note: I stopped taking the Ibuprofen after the second day. I guess I can't take ototoxic drugs.\n\nFor about 6 weeks I did not have chest pain at all. About two weeks ago my chest pain started again. I think it might have been caused by holding my toddler daughter. She weights 40 pounds. The seat belt pressing against my chest causes my chest bone to hurt a little. Carrying bottled water aggravates my chest bone pain. My jacket sometimes aggravates my chest bone pain. Below are my current symptoms\n\nMy current symptoms are:\n1. Chest pain in the middle of my chest on the right middle side (mainly), middle middle of chest (sometimes), and (once in a while) pain on the right middle of my chest. Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel too bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some.\n2. Chest pain in the upper middle right (of breastbone, pain mainly here), upper middle middle (sometimes), and pain on the upper left (once in a while). Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel to bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some.\n3. On the inside on my chest (a couple inches or so inside of chest) on the middle sides (of chest) around the bottom of the lungs or top of liver I get some aching (sometimes its aching and thumping) pain. I am not sure if its muscle pain or what. This pain could last anywhere from a 30 seconds to several minutes to a half hour. Sometimes I get this pain when I sleep on my side.\n4. On occasion if feels I might have some calcification on one of my bones--in this area (mentioned above in number 3.) it feels like the bone calcified a little and is poking my muscle and causing a little pain. This happens on occasion and does not last long.\n5. A little pain on the front sides of my neck. Usually a 1-2 in pain, sometimes a 3 in pain. The pain usually stays with me most of the day.\n6. I get pain once in a while in other parts of my chest. Sometimes about couple inches inside right behind my right pectoral muscle. This pain can last a few minutes to several minutes and then goes away.\n7. Once in a while a little pain about a inch below the clavicle bone (by shoulder). It feels like a nerve or muscle pain. This pain could last from a few minutes to several minutes.\n\nNote: My LUNGS DO NOT hurt or bother me when I breath. I have GERD (acid reflux). I had doctors and a physical therapist tell me that I have tight tendons/muscles throughout my body. When I touch my chest I DO NOT FEEL TENDERNESS IN THE CHEST AREA.\n\n1.

My left ankle twisted all the way backwards before I landed on it, making matters worse. It was excruciatingly painful and I spent about the next ten minutes flat on the ground before the pain just flat out disappeared. At first I thought that I'd just misinterpreted how bad I'd actually hurt it, so I got up and continued on my walk, which was a bad idea because after about thirty minutes, the pain kept slowly creeping back up. By the time I got home it was pretty badly swollen, but I thought I'd just wrap in in an ace bandage, ice it, and go to bed to see how it'd be in the morning. It was worse when I woke up. All movement in that foot was extremely painful and applying any pressure on it shot a pain that felt like someone was sticking red hot needles into my flesh all through the injured area. I didn't go to the doctor because everyone convinced me that it'd be fine after about a month. It didn't get much rest time because due to my day to day life, I have to walk around a lot and I don't have very understanding bosses. It's almost December of the same year now. The pain has gone down, but it hurts bad enough to cause me some concern. The swelling is gone most days unless I move around a significant amount and I have basic movement back in it. I've noticed a long bruise line that wraps around the front of my ankle where it's supposed to bend and when I try to completely straighten out my foot I can't, which I could before I'd hurt it. I keep it in a brace most of the time because without it, my foot just flops to the side like jello and won't stay up right when I'm lying down. I've also noticed a drastic decrease in my balance. I have to be careful while standing still or else I'll topple over. My balance is totally normal while moving, but I have difficulty staying standing at all. I forgot to mention that about a week after the incident, my entire leg had gone completely numb and dead and when I tried walking on it, it completely gave out and twisted backwards in the other direction. Not sure if that's all that important regarding my situation, but thought I'd better mention it. I know it's not broken because the pain doesn't appear to be in the actual bone (which I've broken my bones enough times to know what that feels like). The fact that it's not healed yet though is what really shocks me though because usually my body heals at a faster rate and this seems to be taking quite a long time. I just don't understand, so it'd be very helpful to me if someone knows why it is the way it is.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32387/sprained-ankle"},{"post":{"author":"jack1996","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Hair Follicle Test vs. Urine Test - Hydromorphone Metabolites","post_content":"Hi.

I don't know if I can post a link but here it is if I am allowed: https://www.healthpartners.com/ucm/groups/public/@hp/@public/@ime/@content/documents/documents/cntrb_031044.pdf .\n\nAnyway, my question is this - I will definitely be discussing these results with my doctor at my next appointment. If he doesn't believe me that I haven't taken Dilaudid, I am going to request a hair follicle test at my own expense. But if Hydromophone is a metabolite in a urine test, will it also be one in a hair follicle test?\n\nThanks for your help.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32367/hair-follicle-test-vs-urine-test---hydromorphone-metabolites"},{"post":{"author":"orangeblossom67","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Chronic nerve pain from shingles...any new treatments known?","post_content":"I have had shingles nerve pain for over a year now and am wondering if anyone knows of any new treatments for it.

Now I do massage to reduce pain and have also experimented with essential oils.\nHere is a recipe I created which has helped a few people with zona flare-ups, and seems also useful for minor skin irritations.\nIt is quite strong, so only use one drop at a time. Even though it is strong, it has been well-tolerated. Do not use it on broken skin. Do not get it in your eyes or other mucus membranes. Spread it on the irritated area in as thin a coating as possible.\nFor a 5ml bottle (with single-drop stopper):\n1 drop Vitamin E liquid\n4 drops Bergamot Citrus aurantium (L.) var. bergamia\n4 drops Eucalyptus Eucalyptus globulus\n4 drops Geranium Pelargonium graveolens\n4 drops Lavender Lavandula angustifolia\n6 drops Ravintsara, Cinnamomum camphora\n4 drops Tea Tree Australia Melaleuca\nTake some pure natural coconut oil and warm it in its container in warm water so that it flows easily. Fill the 5ml bottle up with the coconut oil. Close the bottle and shake to mix thoroughly.\n\nIf it is going to help, it will help within a half hour. Discontinue use and wash the area with soap if you have a bad reaction.\nIf it helps, you can use it up to 3-6 times per day, but ONLY one drop at a time.\n\nPlease let me know how it works for you.\n"},{"author":"orangeblossom67","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic nerve pain from shingles...any new treatments known?","resp_content":"Thank you for your reply.

I have never \"lost, misplaced had the pharmacy short me, or accidently ruined\" my narcotic medication. A little over six months ago due to new state laws I had to leave the orthopedic who had been overseeing my pain managment for more than five years, and enter a pain management program with a pain clinic. After the first couple of visits we tweaked my medication, by lessening the strength of my morphine er by more than half, as well as switching from dilaudid to percocet for breakthrough pain and adding gabapentin. The percocet actually seemed to be doing a better job than the dilaudid and was begeninng to reduce the strength of it as well. Then the simple act of reaching for my daughter's cup on a table caused my back to \"lock up\". The new mri would confrim what I had been thinking for the previous 18 months my back was getting worse. Now I not only had the herniation of a disc that was botched on my original injury and surgery, I now had four more to go with it as well as other various problems that go along with this type of problem. My movement has become much more restricted and I do most of my walking with a walker. Because of this I switched from taking a urine test to a saliva test when going to my pain clinic. It was simply easier than trying to hold a cup , hold myself and balance myself. Herein lies the problem, three of my last five test have come up negative for the morphine er, but the percocet is positive. Here are some factors that may need to be considered. 1. It takes a lot of saliva to regesiter, and due to my muscle relaxer I have bad cotton mouth, so I would swirl water and chew gum right up to the point of placing swab in my mouth (as well as still having gum in mouth) 2. I do suffer from type 2 diabetes 3. While I take the percocet only about two hours before the test, it is almost time for me to take my morphine er when I take the test. While they have not taken any action yet I know it can't be too far away. Being new to the program I know I have not built up any trust yet so my \"word\" I'm sure carries very little weight. On my last visit I switched back to urine test in hopes this would solve my problem.

Click on my user name or avatar picture to read my story.\n\nI had to stop working in 2008 at age 51. My genetic chronic severe spinal conditions worsened with age and eventually made it impossible for me to even sit at my desk for more than about 30 minutes. I went out on short term disability and applied for Social Security Disability Insurance. I used an attorney specializing in cases like mine and was approved in 2 months.\n\nThe symptoms you describe do indicate you may be permanently disabled and unable to work. You should contract an SSD attorney who will obtain the medical evidence from your doctors that prove you can no longer work. The SSD attorney will also apply to the SSA for you. What the SSA looks for is that medical evidence - doctor reports and reports from diagnostic tests such as MRI's, etc. Your attorney will submit that medical evidence to the SSA as part of your application process. If you are denied, which is highly likely, your SSD attorney will appeal and you will have a hearing scheduled. The appeal process is lengthy - it could take you 2 or 3 years before you get a hearing. Once you have a hearing, statistics show that 66% of people appealing and SSD denial are approved. One more thing to know is that most SSD attorneys do not charge a fee for a consultation and the application process. They will take a percentage (I think it is 25%) of any back pay you receive from SSD (SSD payments for the months between what your attorney deems to be your date of disability and your approval for SSD payments). If you are approved quickly, your SSD attorney will charge a fee for their efforts. Mine charged me $500.00 since I was approved so quickly and let me make payments until that fee was paid.\n\nIt is definitely very beneficial to contract an SSD attorney for this process. Confirm with your doctors first that they will attest to the fact that you can no longer work due to your condition. There will be quite a bit of forms to complete by your doctors and by you. Your SSD attorney will guide you along the way.\n\nI pray you can get approved soon.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave\n1\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thanks Dave for the info.

I have severe gulf war illnesses and lost my colon with other internal body parts are rotting away. Back in 2000 I was given Prednisone approx. 1200mg/day for about six months. Due to this, I have developed Avascular Necrosis of my right hip. Latest bone density scan says that it is severe, but I already have been feeling this since on or about May, 2003. I was then put on morphine (the pills that disolved under the tongue), it made me really nauseated. As did long acting morphine and methadone. They, the VA, put me on Fentanyl and was on such a high dose that they could never transition me to another drug, not sure if a drug other than Fentanyl is available. I had Ulcerative Colitis and with colon removed, I also have Crohn’s Disease, but in remission for about six years. Was on trials for Remicade/Infliximab and continued with that from civilian infusion centers to the VA every six weeks. After the four abdomen procedures that I have had, I developed over 50 hernias in my gut area. Hernia surgeon in Seattle, said that repair surgery would 50/50% put me in a long term nursing facility for the rest of my life. All of these problems can NOT be determined as to a cause and that is frustrating as hell to me, why or what happened to me.\nThis May, 2017, I was diagnosed with a 40% compression fracture of my T12 vertebrae. At the time of the break, I had been on 150mcg of Fentanyl since about 2010, for the AVN mind you. In the hospital the doctors said that it would be good for me to get off of the fentanyl. After discharge I weened myself off of Fentanyl completely. Did it waaaaaay to fast and had excruciating withdrawls. I plugged along doing physical therapy for the back. In doing the exercises I aggravated my hip and had to go back on the Fentanyl. At the same time I got a new doc at the VA. Now the reason for my post. Sorry for the length but a little background on my issues, I feel would be ok to relay. Oh, had three ACL procedures while on active duty in the Army on left knee. When i had the last surgery my body was rejecting the screws and such. They now say that I will reject any hip procedure...this is why I am on Fentanyl. Want to have something done, but do not want to have complications from it.\nQuestion is...in a roundabout way.... I was on massive dose of Fentanyl and am on Oxycodone for the horrible hernia pain. New doc put me on 12mcg and we had a standing agreement that we would go up to a level that I would get some pain relief. From 150mcg - two months off of Fentanyl and on 12mcg....needless to say when that week was over and still doing physical therapy, I had to go up in dosage. She sent me 25mcg. i still was sucking pond water and last week went to appointment but they had cancelled it that morning. Her nurse, new btw as well, didn’t relay to the doc that the 25mcg patches were not working and as we agreed I would go to the 50mcg. Which is where as a max, i would really like to stop.\nSo, I get home and when the 72hours were up, I put on two of the 25mcg patches on. I have been trying to scale back on The Oxycodone to get a little more life out of my liver, i know that is going to bite me on the ass sooner or later. Two days ago I had my annual urinalysis for the pain clinic, but ordered by my new doc. She got on me as to why my patches are going to be gone about five days earlier than she planned...I told her that I spoke to the nurse as you had cancelled my appointment with you last week. All would have been good go go, if my *** would have been straightened out through the nurse! Doc called today and told me that I showed up as a negative on my piss test...I was like WTF!!! Never heard of catching *** for negative. She said I am probably selling them... I was like..so, I went through the withdrawls, decreased my intake of Oxycodone and I am now selling the 12mcg and new dose 25mcg!!! I said, if I am selling them now, then why wouldn’t I have sold the 100mcg’s and 50mcg patches??\nHow am I showing up negative for both Oxycodone and Fentanyl? I read that since I have done a complete diet change and whatnot, juicing everyday and the minuscule dose might not be metabolizing correctly? Pain clinic doc and pharmacy tech can’t figure it out either but for past 14 years and five pain clinics, never a problem. Any thoughts...? the doc said that for me, and my history and illnesses, that she sent it (urine) to another lab for secondary screening. What is possibly going on here?\nPlease offer advice as I am really wondering and freaking out...is something wrong with me and urine test is messing up or what?

I say that because I am only about 4 months into treatment, and although the headaches have almost completely gone away, I have still had a couple migraines at the beginning ,and still have minor headaches.\nSo to start I am 32 years old, I used to suffer from migraines for only a few years as a preteen and then didn't have them so frequently up until about the last 2 years. They became more and more frequent , and also began to last longer, so instead of accepting being stuck home hiding from sound, light, smells and anything that trigger worse pain or nausea for the NIGHT ,this started continuing on to the next day as well. 2 days in a row of calling in sick to work and now once every few weeks this would happen instead of once a few months, and before that it was once or twice a year.\n\nThis was the point where I got to my breaking point. I was depressed from being in pain so often and missing work and worrying about losing my job because I was missing more and more shifts, losing weight from all of the nausea and just constantly wishing I could just go to sleep and take a mental break from all the stress and pain.\nI am a waitress that hasn't had medical insurance for 10 years and just didn't know where to start without paying an outrageous amount for an MRI out of pocket, or to see specialists.\nThe only medication I was on were oral contraceptives which I was growing suspicious may have had something to do with it when the one common trend to my headaches was developing one for sure every month the night before I started menstruating.\nAfter careful consideration I decided to stop taking the oral contraceptives that I had been on for over 10 years and the only relevant change was I stopped getting the headache at the exact time right before my period would begin (but I still got the migraines other times throughout the month randomly)\nI decided to stay off them because even if I was just avoiding one recurring headache a month, it was worth it.\n\nI also considered getting a \"daith piercing\" because I had heard the location of the piercing passes through a pressure point that accupuncturists use in treatment of migraines, but decided against that in fear of having read that if it is done improperly since the piercing is done through ear cartilage it takes longer to heal, and if the wrong spot was punctured that could possibly activate and trigger more migraine issues. therefore the risk overshadowed the hope in such an easy solution. I did not however fully rule this out in my desperation, but I did bump it down the priority list in things to try to solve this problem.\n\nI was also having some dental work done during the peak of my headache issues and just thought to ask my dentist if he thought there could be any connection between my tooth pain and headaches.\nHe said that he absolutely thought he knew what the problem was after explaining all of my sypmtoms and him showing me a comparable list that anyone could google to see if you have TMJ issues.\nHe explained to me that he was a TMJ specialist that does neuromuscular dentistry as well as does separate treatment programs to alleviate patients of migraines.\nNot knowing anything about what TMJ is or neuromuscular dentistry was and to elaborate to anyone who may not know either...in very basic terms the alignment of my jaw/TMJ (TemporoMandibular Joint) was very off and operating in such a manner that it was causing my jaw to do much extra work to bite down, chew, talk, breathe.. you get the point. All of this extra strain was causing nerves to be strained shooting pain from my jaw to my nerves in my head thus resulting in my migraines (or so we think)\nI was briefly explained a plan of treatment and potential solution but had to commit to the 8,000.00 contract before even trying out the orthodic mouthpiece I was shown that 'should immediately bring me pain relief'\nI underwent a series of tests dome by my 'neuromuscular dentist' such as having electrodes hooked up to my jaw for 2 hours to relax it while also being able to monitor and see how my bite was with computer motion analysis.\nLong story short, they relaxed my jaw, tested and as able to see what it as doing wrong, and then create a new proper bite to train my mouth to do and once finding what the proper bite would be through the electronic monitoring, he then took a mold of my lower jaw I was given a temporary piece to wear until the 30 days from that date that the orthodic piece I was made would be prepared for me.\nThis orthodic piece, looks like a thicker clear invisalign tray that only sits on your bottom teeth almost fully covering them all. You are supposed to keep it in 22-23 hours a day and actually eat with it in as well because I am retraining my jaw to function properly when eating talking and everything else which is why it is so important to keep it in.\nALthough my jaw was very sore the first week getting adjusted to it, I quickly began to feel better. I started skeptical but have been very committed to maintaining it. I was told the treatment would last 6-9 months and the only maintenance is an occasional appointment to have it adjusted which just consists of it being fitted or shaved down ever so slightly to keep it fitting correctly. I am also much more aware of when I clench my jaw or bite down usually from stress which can cause extra tension.\n\nNOW, the downfall. I have no dental insurance so I pay everything out of pocket and this treatment costs 8,000.00\nThen after that I may still be looking at having to get Invisalign (est 5,500.00) (AGAIN , because I had it about 7 years ago and did not wear a retainer) as well as crowns and/or bridges? I can not be told exactly what my next step is until i finish the first one, (but honestly as much as I fear the realities that dentistry is a business and I very well also did sign a waiver accepting that this is not a guaranteed fix for the problem) but that was a risk I was willing to take.\n\nIf anyone reading this has felt the desperation that you either feel for yourself or from having watched a loved one suffer, you know that at some point you would either pay or try almost anything to rid yourself of this problem.\nSo at this point I am happier, and hopeful, but still unsure if this is permanent cure and what financial situation I will be getting myself into but I am still in a lot better position than I was in right before starting this treatment, and it keep improving more and more with time.\nI plan to get insurance very soon and to get a thorough check up, but in the meantime I am grateful to be trying what I would so far call a wonderful solution.\nI hope my story was somewhat helpful, and I will be happy to answer any other questions or provide any information if it may help.\n"},{"author":"anita532","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Daily Migraine","resp_content":"I started having migraines about age 2 as well. Am now 67 years old. I would have them almost 20/30 days. Didn't learn until I was 25 how to make myself better. Foods are a big trigger. Fruits are a really big trigger. I did everything you did including learning self hypnosis. That helps the most. Could never control a migraine pain once it started, but i had less of them. Then the BIG break came. I developed severe Hashimoto's Thyroid around age 25 as well. Almost cost me my life. The severity of Hashimoto's put me into early menopause at age 28-29. Guess what - the migraines lessened a LOT. Got better every year. Now at age 67 I still get them occasionally, but I am also able to take lots of codeine. Please, always give gravol with meds. Big help. I now have severe osteoarthritis in my neck and get steroid shots into my neck. They help lots. My chiropractor is a life saver. I have also developed severe Fibromyalgia, it affects mostly my neck, shoulder, etc. My doc gives me lidocaine injections , it helps a lot and lasts a couple of days for me. I would strongly suggest a few things. Get her to learn self hypnosis for what limited help it can give. Get her on the birth control pill if she is over 12 years old. Might have to try a few of them. Water pills like lasix or whatever 3 days a week with potassium. MAGNESIUM is a must! No more oranges, sour cream, maybe no chocolate or maybe yes, read and re-read the food list regarding migraine. What helped me a lot when I went into early menopause, although I still got some migraines, is LEARNING that I was no longer a victim. Sure, still got them, but no longer a victim. This realization went a long way to dispel them. Don't overlook the possible need for eyeglasses. Caffeine helps some people, hurts others. Experiment with giving Sinus medications along with the pain killers, 20 minutes apart. Like this: Gravol, 20 min later pain med, then 20 min later sinus med, then 20 min later more pain med as needed. Continue with pain med as needed. This is the doctor approved method as taught to me.

I have had them all my life of over 70 years. In the last 15 years they have turned chronic. I now have a migraine every day. The only reason they do not constantly interfere with my daily life is because I have learned how to control them with assistance from some of the top migraine specialists and pain control clinics in the world. As a facilitator of a peer to peer support group this is what I have learned:\n- There is no one type of migraine and as such, no treatment works for every one or most every one. Each individual requires customized treatment to manage their migraine.\n- Many migraines can be successfully managed without regular medication or physical treatment through psychological training using techniques such as CBT, ACT, and Biofeedback. This should accomplished through proper training by licensed medical practitioners and chronic pain clinics who specialize in these techniques for chronic pain management. Examples include the Mayo Clinic and Stanford, among others. Some or all of this treatment may be covered by insurance.\n- Many medications have side effects that ultimately cause more issue that are worse than the migraines.\n- Some migraines have no triggers\n- The less medication you can get by on, the better the long term results will be.\n- Often, medications that work in the beginning will cease their usefully in weeks, months, or years.\n-Too frequent use of any medication can often actually trigger a migraine or other side effects. This is called \"rebound\".\n- Most medications have side effects and affect each individual differently. Age and gender can be a factor in this.\n- Don't experiment with changing too many factors or variables at once. Change one at a time and give it time to show its effects. Otherwise you may never be able to identify a trigger or treatment.\n- Find a health care professional you trust and stick with them until they have given up or you lose confidence or trust. Research the background of every health professional providing care.\n- Many new medications lack the proper history to determine their long term effects, both good or bad. A sizable number are recalled after a year or two of use due to initially discovered negative consequences.\n- NEVER trust drug advertisements, especially prescription drug advertisements. Their focus is your wallet. Trust you health care provider to make the proper recommendations. That is what they are trained to do. If you cannot trust them, find another provider.\n- Recent research has demonstrated that long term use of opioids for chronic pain control will ultimately increase the intensity of chronic pain. While excellent choices for acute (short term) pain, they are a poor choice for chronic (long term) pain for most people. If you health care practitioner recommends regular use or preventive use for chronic pain such as chronic migraines, do as I did; change practitioners. This was one of the best decisions I made for my own treatment.\n- Finally DON'T give up. It may take time but eventually some treatment, discovery, or combination of treatments will ultimately give you better control of you chronic migraine.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Chronic Daily Migraine","resp_content":"I, too, have had migraines since I was a child---4 yrs. old..

I started seeing a physical therapist and it seemed to be helping at first. I was doing better so he progressed me to the next level (one-legged bridges, bands, etc.). It seemed fine but I woke up the next morning with pain around the top of the low back on both sides. It was pretty sharp and hurt with each step. I told the physical therapist about it and he said it sounded like a different issue and seemed to think it was stress. I started having numbness in the low back as well.\n\nThat was almost a month ago. I decided to see a chiropractor, who told me I shouldn't do bridges. I wish I had listened.

I had an MRI done and they said I have a slightly protruding disc between l4 and l5 but nothing that explains my current pain. I am so much worst off than I was.

If you click on my username you can read my biography to see how I have been managing moderate to mostly severe chronic pain for over 40 years.\n\nWhat type of doctor is this \"spine and pain specialist\" you are seeing on Tuesday? You should be seeing a spinal orthopedic surgeon and/or a spinal neurosurgeon first. That doctor will order a fresh MRI, review the results, diagnose what is causing your pain and then recommend an effective treatment plan. You should have no further treatment, or do any type of yoga, until you have that accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan in place.\n\nI pray you find answers and relief soon.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave\n"},{"author":"ridgebacklover","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thanks Dave! I found out I actually have a tear in the disc but it's not herniated thankfully. They gave me steroid injections which I will get 3 times every 2 weeks. I think I'm already starting to feel some relief! I'm just so scared of being in pain on my wedding day and then in the long term, that it might not heal. From what I've researched, it seems like because they dont get much blood flow, they don't always heal, even after years, which is really scary. Has anyone on here experienced this before? I'm so scared.","resp_content":"Reply\ndavedsel2\nover 2 years ago\nHello again. You are welcome.\n\nDrink plenty of water - several quarts per day. Staying hydrated helps heal any problems with discs in many cases. You can try glucosmine which I take daily and does help somewhat. If you are not sure what it is, do a yahoo or google search for more info. It is basically ground-up seashells and is usually combined with other things like chondroiten, MSM, manganese, other minerals and/or vitamin D3. Another supplement I take is Ceylon cinnamon. This is a specific type of cinnamon that helps with joint pain, blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol and other health conditions.\n\nAnother suggestion would be to consider seeing a good chiropractor. Many people do not agree with their methods, but I have been having frequent chiropractic adjustments for 15 years. Two local neurosurgeons and my orthopedic surgeon have attested to the fact that my chiropractor has helped keep me functioning and so far out of a wheel chair. My chiro does a straight adjustment - no gizmos or disc decompression. I have found chiropractic adjustments very helpful for my chronic pain.\n\nI pray you have continued relief and have much less pain for you upcoming wedding.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave\nReply\nridgebacklover\nover 2 years ago\nHi Dave,\n\nThank you so much! I ordered a glucosamine supplement with MSM, turmeric and chondroiten - definitely worth a shot! I'll also try to increase my water intake. I'm just wondering how much the issue I had standing for extended periods of time prior to all this is related. I hope it is being addressed too.\n\nI actually started seeing a chiropractor right after the physical therapy incident. He actually helped quite a bit with my neck but didn't seem to help my back. I was only seeing him for a couple of weeks though and am taking a break until after the steroid injections are done. He was doing straight adjustments too and I wondered whether that was a good idea with how tight and inflamed I was. I was referred to him by a friend who had great success with him on a different issue. I guess my question is how do you know if they are a good chiropractor? I'm scared because I've heard a bad one can actually make things worse but I think I could really benefit from chiropractic in the long term. He has all good reviews but has only been in business for a few years. Just him and no other fancy gadgets or anything. Would love your thoughts on this. I feel like I made a lot of little decisions that worsened my problem in an attempt to improve it and don't want to do any more damage!\nReply\nlambda5555m2012\nover 2 years ago\nHi, I have had 2 laminectomies and now a crushed vertebra, so I can't go to a chiropractor. The one I saw when my back started hurting told me if he can't fix me in about 3 visits, I need to go see a doctor. The first was painful, the second more, so he said I need to see a doctor who found out I had herniated discs. He fixed people quickly and sent them on their way and he didn't string people out coming back all the time. That's the kind of guy/girl you need to fix you if possible...:-) Hope you had a great wedding!!!\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Low back pain - getting desperate.","resp_content":"I hope you are married by now...or almost. And, I fervently hope you are pain free. In case you still need \"help,\" I can recommend Dr. John Sarno's work on TMS --- Tension Myositis Syndrome. Basically, the cause is distress/stress, buried in your psyche. It usually is anger but it can be grief, hurt, etc. (Which both encompass anger.) I did not understand that I had so much repressed anger until I started psychotherapy. I now realize that anger happens from the time we are born and accumulates over time. I have had the misfortune (or fortune, as Iike to think) of an angry mother, losses to death of a husband and a daughter, a divorce, and a distressed relationship with my current husband, as well as the usual hurts that come with life. I guess I had reached my limit of adapation when I started having chronic pain. And then I was getting better when I experienced PTSD related to my daughter's death. I still have nerve pain but believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that it is emotional in origin. I know it will go away - when, I don't know. I have been living with this for five years but am optimistic that there is an end in sight. How and why - that is up to God. I wish you splendid fortune and complete healing.

It felt like every inch of my legs were hurting, and I had never felt such pain before. After ten full minutes, I thought about calling 911, but then the pain in my left leg subsided and most of my right leg stopped hurting, except for my calf and foot. I didn't do anything about it because I thought I might have just had a bad cramp.\n\nNow it has happened two more times (not as long, but the same things happens) and it lingers in my right leg for maybe six hours before fading away. I am away at school, so I don't have a doctor in the area, just my health center (who don't really deal with things other than flu, colds, stomachaches, etc.) and a very large hospital on campus. I went to the health center, and obviously they didn't know what to do, but suggested I went to the doctor.\n\nSo I guess my question is, do I go to the hospital, or is it nothing serious?

I'm a 26 year old female with multiple disc herniations and bulges down my lumbar spine. Unfortunately, I have a congenital defect with a narrower spinal canal than most. This causes any disc bulge or herniation to present more pain as already affecting nerves due to tightness from what I've been told. I had a spinal surgery (discectomy and laminectomy) at 19 years old level l2/l3 at Mayo Clinic in MN after being in severe pain for a year. After the surgery my pain was still present and essentially I had a steroid injection there several months after surgery. I had the injection and got up off of the table and was immediately pain free for the past 7 years. Fast forward to March of this year when my worst nightmare happened and the pain came back. My pain always presents itself in the left leg from hip to ankle. I tried PT and then MRI revealed same situation, herniation and bulging on multiple levels. I had an ESI done and after a month I was pain free again (Not sure if due to injection or inflammation flared down again.) Then August 14 comes around and I stupidly decided to go ahead and go to Boston for work (I live in Indy) when I woke up that morning in excruciating pain. I walked through both airports but when I got to baggage claim I had my coworkers get my bags and I left without them\nIn a taxi straight to Mass Gen Hospital. By the time I walked inside ER I could barely function. They finally gave me a variety of pain meds but nothing even touched it. After sitting in ER for almost 12 hours they finally moved me to their observation unit where I spent two full days, again nothing touching pain. They did no imaging but did finally send in pain mgmt team who agreed to do ESI. They basically wanted to get me out of there and back to IN. I somehow was able to get on plane and home and my mom has been taking care of me for the past 5 weeks. No one in Indiana that I have seen seems very competent, mostly ortho surgeons and I'm not letting them do a spine surgery if it comes to that. Getting pain medicine is like pulling teeth thanks to all of the lovely people who have abused pills for so long. I did get in with a pain mgmt doctor that I saw with my last bout who has me on 600mg lyrica and 10mg oxycodone (I maybe take 1 or 2 per day as trying to ration and do not feel great taking it). He also did another ESI at the l2/l3 level this past Tuesday. I am currently trying to get back into Mayo Clinic as I feel\nComfortable with their skills and treatment plans. I have tried PT for a week but my PT was basically at his wits end as I am at a pain level 8 for the past month and walk bent forward and to the left. He tried a variety of things with me and none seemed to give me any relief whatsoever. I am starting to get very depressed as I have a very successful career and life that I can not live. I spend most of the day in bed and my mom has to help bathe me, etc. I don't feel like myself at all and with back pain there is no forseeable end in sight.

I don't have any liver or kidney problems to start with and that is very important with this approach.\nI take acetaminophen (1000mg) and Ibuprofen (400) together twice a day. It really seems to help more than all of the other things I have tried. Because they work in different ways and because they affect different internal organs they work synergistically and they are safe to take if your liver and kidneys are not already damaged by all of the pain relievers we have all tried. I'm also taking 300mg of Tramadol ER daily. I take trazadone for sleep and although I'm never really out of pain I am able to find ways to distract myself from it.

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced.\n\n*May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.)\nA few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.\n*June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way.\n*June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) \"brain fog\", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.\n*After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*.\nFrom June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms.\nI was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.\n*June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside.\n*June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist.\n*June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.\nA few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!!

Very similarly. Not the sinus infection, but severe pain, widespread diffuse, the fog, anxiety, inability to sleep. I took so much ibuprofen I it is no wonder I didn't kill my kidneys. 4 hot baths a night. I was working full time as a nurse in a drs office. I did at first have a moderately high ANA, RA , ESR and it slowly came down to normal with overdosages of steroid which could have killed me. Years later still just functioning all I was doing in my life was basically working , to help keep my family income so we could make it. I would have periods, brief, of feeling better, and I would over do it and wind up feeling bad again. Stress is the worst thing on your health no matter what your diagnosis is. Approximately 20 years down the road, it was found I was positive for the Lyme and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , so at some time I had both of those diseases without being treated. I've seen Rhematologist over the years, internal medicine, had back surgery by neurosurgeon, severe arthritis in my lower back, and up and down my spine. It would take me all day to list the things I've tried alternatively and traditional medicine. I've read extensively, heard of so many similar experiences. I exhausted all organic causes and I would encourage anyone with a life altering change in health to do so. In the end, what works for me, is first lowering the stress in your life, believe me I know how difficult that is to do. During this journey I lost my husband of 23 years suddenly to pulmonary embolism. My children went through divorces. I remarried to a wonderful man who is so supportive and helps me tremendously. I go to my chiropractor regularly, I have body work done, these people are hard to find, drink plenty of fluids and eat fairly clean diet. Avoid gluten, very little alcohol, avoid sugar and eat very little red meat. Take supplements that I need like vit d, multi vit, vit e, c, and coq10, iron as I'm iron deficient. Go regularly to my dr who I found over 15 years ago that believes in traditional medicine and non traditional. Supports and believes my symptoms are real and treats me with dignity. That is so important. I don't expect the impossible from him, he evaluates and treats me as we go along this journey. Having your family and those around be supportive is so essential no matter what is your diagnosis Or illness. Rest and pace myself. I probably would have done better if I had instituted these changes in my life to start with but I didn't know back then even as a nurse. I see a psychiatrist because this caused a lot of self doubt and mental anguish not knowing what was wrong. I try not to worry about tomorrow no more than I have to because as the Bible says each day is sufficient for its own anxieties. Keeping my body in a low inflammatory state is essential. Am I better? In some aspects, my bad days are better and I have more good days. I've aged since this all started over 25 years ago. What's caused it? I'm not sure. I believe a combination of things. Read read read and find supportive health care people in all areas, most of all , don't lose hope. Enjoy the minutes that are okay, and look for humor as often as you can. Laughing is good for your body even when it hurts. I wouldn't presume to know what is going on your body or life. I wrote this to let you know, you are not alone, which chronic and unknown illness can cause, to give you hope to keep fighting. Be careful of people who suggest certain medications over the internet who are not qualified to prescribe, even though well intentioned. Know nothing of your medical history and who you are as a person, we re all unique and need to be looked at and treated that way. I wish you the best on your journey and hope you can find answers. The unknown is our greatest fear.\n2\n"},{"author":"xxmbxx","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you so much, this was really insightful and ment alot :(","resp_content":"1\nReply\nAnonymous\nover 2 years ago\nJust wanted to thank the nurse who replied/responded to writer, as this describes my now 35 yr old daughter who has had all these symptoms since college!, & recently has gotten much worse - I feel due to stress- finished grueling grad school while also working PT.

Please take the anti-anxiety medication and you may find that some of the Lesser symptoms may go away. As far as the numbness and tingling I don't know what to tell you honey you definitely should see an orthopedic doctor for what's going on in your legs and your back. You could have an impinged nerve or something to that effect. I wish you all the best of luck and please please please see a neurologist or an orthopedic doctor right away.

I have a lot of the same symptoms that are listed in your post. I have widespread pain, headaches, tremors and other weird symptoms. My blood pressure goes through the roof at times, but will also go to the bottom of the blood pressure spectrum. I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (diagnosed by a Rheumatologist) and was prescribed Cymbalta, which I could not take because it caused severe tremors, flushing and sweating. After that, the Rheumatologist prescribed Tizanidine and Amitriptyline. The Tizanidine is a muscle relaxer and the Amitriptyline is a mild antidepressant that was prescribed to me for help falling asleep. I've been on these meds for about 3 years. They do help, but I still have a lot of pain during the day that I just have to live with because the meds listed above make me sleepy. My employer would not appreciate me taking meds that would make me sleepy at work. In addition to the symptoms listed above, I have recently started having other symptoms. My feet hurt every day and I have spent a lot of money trying to find help for this pain. My doctor gave me the name of a podiatrist that I haven't made an appointment with yet, but I probably will. I also now have a relatively new problem with my gastrointestinal system. I spent 9 days in the hospital recently with a diagnosis of pancreatitis. In the last 12 months, I've lost 30 pounds. I have to be very careful about my fat intake. I have to try and keep the fat to about 5g or less, per meal. If you Google pancreatitis, you will see that most of the time, pancreatitis is caused by drinking too much alcohol. I don't drink alcohol. It was decided that my pancreatitis was caused by some diuretics that were prescribed to me for water retention. Other media can cause pancreatitis, so I have to be very aware of any nasty side effects of all meds prescribed to me. I hope my narrative offers some help to you. I would highly suggest going to see a Rheumatologist.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Fibro?Ms? something else? in pain and need answers!","resp_content":"I looked up a page on Facebook called krantom support page , no saying its a miracle herb or anything because I live in a state where you can't get it but there are a lot of folks who swear by it.

I'm a 27 year old female with a history of endometriosis and the occasional ovarian cyst. I had a laparoscopy and subsequently was on Lupron when I was 17 years old and have been taking various birth controls ever since...\n\nI haven't had much of any reproductive issues since I've been on birth control, in fact I completely forgot what a cyst felt like, but in December I decided to switch from the weekly birth control patch and commit to an IUD. Mirena was the one recommended to me at my annual. After getting over the initial cramping and state of shock my uterus was in (which tapered off after a couple weeks) I started to notice some sharp and achey pains in my lower right abdomen, right where I would assume my ovary is.\n\nThese pains would last anywhere from a few seconds to about 10 minutes... I got in the habit of carrying Menstridol around with me everywhere I go, which always seemed to help if it didn't go away on it's own. The pain level would be anywhere from about a 4, a dull achey pain... to about a 9, a sharp achey pain that would start pretty dull and gradually crescendo into what I could only assume is a cyst rupturing. These more severe cases would typically be accompanied by spotting.\n\nThe frequency of the incidents is what's alarming to me. I hardly ever go a day without a symptom, and the most extreme symptoms are happening a couple times a week. Part of me assumes my body needs time to adjust and this is a side effect that will work itself out and become less frequent. However, now it's 9 months later and it hasn't slowed down/become less severe at all.\n\nIn fact, just a couple nights ago I had the worst experience yet, I was woken up 3 separate times with level-9, cyst-rupturing pains.\n\nIs this something that other people experience with IUDs? Is there something more serious going on with me that I should be concerned about? Also, is it odd that this is ALWAYS occuring on the right side?

Anyway I've been seeing/talking with my doctor and so far I've just had my blood taken and had to give a stool sample. Everything came out negative.

I am seeking help.\n\nI have withdrawn from benzos (4mg Klonopin) and opioids (200mg Oxycodone) at the beginning of this year. The benzodiazepine taper took 6 months. The Oxycodone was cold turkey.\n\nAnyways, at the moment I suffer from a groin injury for a few weeks now that hurts pretty bad at night which keeps me awake. So I tried to take Oxycodone on occasion. However, suddenly, the Oxycodone causes pain at two spots in my body that have been injured previously. My right wrist and my right shoulder. Everytime I take Oxycodone, those to spots start to hurt. I had a wrist strain a year ago and a shoulder bursitis. Both injuries healed (MRI was done). But still, the Oxycodone causes the same pain in those areas that I had a year ago.\n\nNow I am wondering if it has to do with the fact that I have withdrawn from the benzos. It seems Oxycodone indirectly lowers GABA and that opioid induced pain can be caused by NMDA and 5HT-3 receptor overactivity - both receptors go into overdrive during benzodiazepine withdrawal and both can cause pain. I also notice that I get muscle tightness in my neck and jaw after taking Oxycodone. Something that I never had when I took Oxycodone years ago before I used benzodiazepines.\n\nI have read that opioid induced hyperalgesia is pretty common. However, why do only those previously injured spots start to hurt when I take a medication that is supposed to help with pain?\n\nMy groin injury is so bad that I need opioids to sleep, but it gives me aching pain in my wrist and shoulder that it is not of a big help.\n\nWhat's the mechanism behind this phenomen? Could it really be the GABA deficiency and NMDA overactivity I am suffering from due to benzo withdrawal or is there more to it?\n\nKind regards!","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"abyzou","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Oxycodone causes pain at the same spots everytime","resp_content":"Forgot to add that my tinnitus gets worse too after Oxycodone.

I have deteriorating spondylolisthesis (spondylolisthesis diagnosed as a teen), spinal stenosis, arthritis, and bulging discs in my spine.

Sometimes I will have 11 different places on my body that are hurting at the same time. But like you most of my problems are centered around my back. Around three years ago I had a Medtronic pain pump put in, that holds concentrated medications. Mine is in my abdomen, and has a tube that goes around my side under the skin and hooks into The spine. I've tried three different medications in it and they seem to cause me to overheat so I'm thinking about having it taken out. I've talk to my pain specialist about replacing it with the electrical stimulator instead. If I do that then I won't have any of these strong medications flowing through my body which I would prefer. It has helped a lot with the back pain but it doesn't seem to touch the nerve pain. I also seem to have developed a lot of scar tissue you around the pump itself which my doctor said is what they want because it helps hold it in place, but the scar tissue hurts. I wasn't expecting that. So now I have to use lidocaine patches on my skin over the pump. If it's not one thing it's another, right?\nRight now I'm not taking any oral medications for pain. If you talk to your doctor about having a pump installed they will give you phone numbers to other patients that have had it put in and you can find out how they did with their's and make your decision from then. But I only talk to patients who had the pump Put in, and not the electrical stimulator which I think I will be switching to.

I do know how you feel. I have dealt with chronic pain for 17 years. I know how frustrating it can be. To be able to get\noff opiods would be a dream come true. I will not even comment as to what I take being as there are so many who disapprove. I have been lucky with my pain management doctors as well as my rheumatologist and have never been told it was all in my head. Believe me, at times I wondered.\nLike you, I have done all the steroid shots, nerve burning as well as been to physical therapy over twenty times. Accupuncture helped me stopped smoking but could not help with my pain. Yoga, tai chi and daily exercising as well as walking 3 miles a day has never helped the pain. Some cases it has made it worse. I do know I have to keep moving so I do. Sometimes with tears streaming down my face.\nIn 2010 I had a Pain stimulator put in. I had 2 trials that were successful and was recommended a go ahead after therapy sessions. I was out of pain and totally off my paid meds. For 10 weeks. Only 10 weeks. They worked with the programs for several years. I kept it in but was back on pain meds.\nAfter about five years I saw a neurosurgeon that did neck surgery on my husband. The leads had moved upwards drastically. So we decided to try a new one with different type of leads. Scar tissue was too bad to get new leads in so it was all removed. This doctor could not find anything he could do for me to help me but he never doubted my pain.\nI wish I had a success story for you but I don't. Hopefully there is someone out there that has. I do know that we are all individual and what works for one may not for another one. I also know that people have to have something to believe in and we all have to try whatever it takes to improve our quality of life.\nSo research and keep asking around. First find you a pain management group that treats you with respect. They are out there. My pain meds were changed different times as I built up a tolerance to them. I cannot take NSAIDS at all as they shut down my kidneys. I do not take them to get high either or crave them. Trust me when I say this: I would rather be able to have a glass of champagne or a martini!\nI have had some help with Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine. The doctor found my sacrum had moved drastically due to some tendon injury. They also manipulative my spine, hips, and si joints which help me to keep moving. I am in awe of this group. I live in the Fort Worth area so I go to UNT Health Science.\n\nGood luck Dawn with whatever you choose to do. I know you are desperate for some relief and understanding.\nIf I find that magic wand I will send it to you!

Your body gets used to them and builds up a tolerance. Once you start taking your pain meds again you'll find they work better, like they used . I have degenerative disc disease and it's rapidly getting worse. The CDC states that no Doctor is to deny a patient's pain meds therapy in fear of losing their license.

Last fall I began waking up with my left knee hurting. Usually I'd just stretch and feel better, but I didn't really think about it.\n\nBy January, I was walking with a limp and in pain, taking OTC pills to relieve it. I saw a doctor in February, she ordered bloodwork, an xray, and that I do some stretches as she thought I had sciatica.\n\nThe xray didnt reveal anything special, nor did the bloodwork. After doing her stretches for a week, I could barely walk and felt severe pain. My parents pressured me to go to a chiropractor, and that's what I did.\n\nAfter some sessions, the chiropractor encouraged me to get an MRI on my lower spine. I did and it revealed that I had two protruding discs (L4 and L5-s) and he said I should try spinal decompression. After about 12 sessions of that, the pain only got worse. I stopped seeing him and have tried some stretches.\n\nWhile seeing him, my knee started popping. When asked, he said it was probably a leftover high school football injury, but my knee didn't pop before this.\n\nOverall, my pain has gotten better, but I'm nowhere near where I want to be. It has shifted, mostly condensed in my left knee and buttock, but it has moved to my hip.\n\nMy question is, what could I possibly have? Who should I see? Why is my knee suddenly popping?

Then focus on things in your life that make you happy and do them on your schedule. Also, I've tried almost every modality available and the ones that helped me were, Nueromuscular Massage Therapy ( Myofacial Release), self hypnosis, listening to my favorite music ( my music isn't relaxing but I find it gets me to sleep), a really good bed ( tried them all and found the \"Sleep Number\" worked the best for me). Getting to realize your capabilities and learn to ask for help or do it yourself. I've found doing things myself again builds good cognitive awareness. Ice over heat. TENS, is a good distraction and sometimes it helps. I really have more but it feels like I'm writing a book so I'll stop here.\n\nLastly, I want to point out medications I ended up taking after many years of hard opiates ( that's a whole story within itself).\n\nI've found that Gabapentin, Klonopin, Lidocaine Patches, Vitamin D with Folic Acid, Wellbutrin ( for the depression) Celebrex are the major pills I take everyday.

To them you ridicule I call you WARRIORS, you fight all day every day for your health, I recognize your efforts and call you brave. P.S. you use your chef talents to applaud yourself, I wish you would use your success to encourage others and not belittle. Find your kindness, it will serve you better and others too.\nReply\nlatteobsession\nover 2 years ago\nDear Anoynomous Poster both above and below this post,\nI'm not here to argue with any of you by any means. I think that it is extremely important to share correct information. As the RN posted below, on the Pain Scale between 1-10, at 10 every doctor I've ever been to has described 10 \"As the worst pain you can imagine\". Has nothing to do with \"passing out\" from pain. Secondly OxyContin is not used to treat pain from a broken wrist or a pulled tooth. OxyContin is ONLY prescribed for Chronic Pain or to Cancer Patients.\n\nIt's true that pain medication is seriously abused, but no one has the right to ridicule others for describing their pain or their so called \"whining\", especially in this forum. I personally have a high pain threshold and I'm grateful for that, but I'd never look at some one else and be harsh because I'm different in dealing with and feeling pain.\nEveryone has their own pain and yes sometimes people become focused on their pain and struggle to deal with their situation. Depression is also a major problem for Chronic Pain sufferers. We shouldn't judge from afar, as we don't know what else is going on in their lives.\nI prefer to keep it positive and share what works for me, because you never know you might help someone try something they weren't aware would work for them. Ridiculing, calling people out and only focusing on the negative only serves one purpose and that's to insult and hurt others. I was born and raised in the South and I still remember my Grandmothers words \"If you don't have anything good to say, then keep it to yourself\" those words have served me well in life. In the meantime I hope that we'll all remember to keep our post positive and if we find we can't then we'll just keep it to ourselves. Wishing you all comfort and tolerable days.\n1\nReply\npeonygirl1\nover 2 years ago\nHi again, just back to this website and have an observation to share with you and all. When a person posts anonymously the message is not real valid to me and as I continue to observe other messages with no identification I have no way of knowing if I am or others are responding to original post(person). That too takes credibility away for me. As a result your posts or are they your post are lacking the integrity that makes discussions of value. A thought to consider.\nReply\npeonygirl1\nover 2 years ago\nHi, I do take you seriously, the confusion is if one is not identifiable how do I know if you or someone else posted for you or not.

I have been on controlled medication for 12 years. I take my medication faithfully (I can’t emphasize enough on the word faithfully) I take 2 medications for sleep; Ambien CR 12.5mg every night and Clonazepam 0.5mg x1 every night and 1 medication for pain Oxycodone 10/325mg x4. This has worked best for me for 12 years. I’m not 100% pain free maybe more like 80%. I wouldn’t be able to function if I didn’t take it. I follow all the rules of my controlled Drug Agreement my doctor had me sign. I see my Dr every 4 months for my Fibromyalgia as instructed. I am a good patient. Then it all changed in a blink of an eye. And all it took was a new doctor and a faulty Drug Test or maybe human error on the lab/doctors part or one other possible thought is I’ve been on a herbal supplement for a month and a half, however I told the nurse when I got tested I have this in my system. A false Negative was my result. I’m very upset and afraid of the outcome. I can’t say for sure if the new doctor that is taking over my doctor’s office wants to get rid of Chronic Pain patients or if there was truly a mistake with the drug test I took. I fault like heck to get the doctor on the phone because this test is absolutely without a doubt wrong. In my opinion, a person accused of not having the medication in there system when they do take it, is worse than a false positive. If I were to have a positive the doctor would say your done and give me a months’ worth of medication and a weaning schedule as per My Controlled Drug Agreement. But no its worse because I take the medication and because the drugscan lab gave me wrong results I will not be able to get a month of medication because the dr assumes it’s not in my system. I am scared to death. Have you ever read about Clonazepam withdrawal when done abruptly? It can be deadly it can cause a seizure that I may not be able to come out of. I just read this a few days ago while trying to figure out how to come off of 3 different medications. I fortunately had 1 refill of 30 left on the Clonazepam, Except I don’t know how to taper. I told the nurse who called me I need to know how to withdraw from all these medications her smart remark was you don’t need to know because it’s not in your system. I cried it is in my system I take it every day I swear to you. Im not lying. She didn’t care. What do I do? I don’t even know where to begin to wean off my medicines. I only have a few Ambien left and a few weeks of oxycodone left. I figure id start to come off the least medicine first which is Ambien CR. Its been 2 days off and last night I woke up with brain zaps at 2am. Couldn’t go back to sleep because of it. It was a creepy feeling I could only feel it when I laid down once I was up it went away. I sent a letter out fax and certified to the dr on Thursday asking him to help me wean down. And that his drug test is wrong. I need his help. He hasn’t called me back. I also sent a certified letter to Drugscan lab. What can I do? Can I get a lawyer?

When I was younger, I just thought they were growing pains, so I never paid attention to them. When I get the pain, it’s usually just in one leg or arm, either side of my body, from the uppermost joint (shoulder/hip) to the extremity (fingers/toes). Each pain lasts anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days; it’s not a shooting pain or an achy soreness, more of a dull pain that doesn’t go away with ice/heat/rest/exercise/pain medicine. It never inhibits me from moving or walking – the pain is normally about a 5 out of 10 when I’m resting, without applying pressure. With pressure/walking, it might increase to a 7 or 8 out of 10, but never more than that.\nIt happens year-round, when I’m at my most active – playing a contact sport 6 day a week for months – and at my least active – doing no exercise for months at a time. For the past 6 months, I’ve kept track of the pains and I’ve noticed that they generally come in 2-week intervals. For example, I’ll experience a pain in my right leg one day, then two days later it’ll be a pain in my left arm, then the next day a pain in my left leg. Then, I’ll be pain-free for 12-16 days and the same thing will occur again. The intervals of pain will typically be 5-10 days, consisting of 3-5 incidents of pain, followed by two pain-free weeks.\nI’ve seen an orthopedist, rheumatologist, and currently a neurologist, none of whom have been able to change anything, and my blood tests and enzyme tests have come up normal. They’ve ruled out lyme, rheumatoid arthritis, all myalgias. Was on a Vitamin D Rx for two months, that ended a month ago.\nHave had a history of irregular periods, where I went from having a period every day for six months, to taking Junel Fe birth control pills to regulate my periods.

I've even gone so far as to have someone take a vice-wrench or whatever it's called to clamp down as hard as they could as deeply and as far into my shoulder blade as possible but that has only caused lack of feeling on the surface and the internal pain is getting worse.

I was dx with RA 18 yrs ago and have had some success with taking Enbrel for 14 yrs and then Humira for 3 yrs, along with a whole basket full of other RX's too. Just as I was finally enjoying the success of those meds in regards to my rheumatoid arthritis, I was dx with a multitude of neck and low spine issues. Advanced degenerative disc disease (in a nut shell) in both areas, with my low back giving me the most trouble at this time. Nothing much really can be done and the specialist says it will only get worse with time---not very encouraging I'm afraid. I have just had an epidural in my lumbar area a couple weeks ago, I can't say that it has helped much at all, am not sure I'll be going for anymore of those. I find that I have only so much pain-free energy each day---a couple of hrs that I can actually get some things done, housework or gardening, it's always in the mornings and by lunchtime my day is done. I take 2 RX's at lunch and then afterwards I find that if I lay down and rest for a couple hrs then I can usually get in a short walk with my 2 dogs. So that's my day--pretty much everyday. I'm not complaining because I'm thankful to be able to do as much as I do, not that a few hrs of \"work\" a day is a lot by any means but there are so many folks who can't even do that much!

People don't believe you can always be in pain. Often in your own circle of family and friends you won't find people who understand and talking to them seems to drive them away. It can lead to depression, and sadly often times coping skills aren't there so when the stress increases the pain, and ANY stress can, you can find yourself taking one more painkiller, just this once. I'll urge anyone not to do that. It's step one into addiction. It's hugely important to keep lines of communication open and honest with your doctor. Don't be worried about psych help as it can help. Meditation relaxation and really enjoying the little things in life make a huge impact. I'm using narcotic painkillers, and Wellbutrin as well as occasionally taking klonopin for anxiety.

That said, you can \"adjust\" above and below the level of stenosis and also use a variety of muscle techniques to improve movement.

You might try a trial of acupuncture or chiropractic, 5-7 visits. If there are signs of significant muscle atrophy (shrinkage) and lost reflexes that correlate with the MRI findings, surgery may be the right choice. Just be sure to get at least two if not three separate medical opinions from doctors not associated with each other (in separate offices).

I don't speak fluent Hungarian so I wasn't aware of the information about the Flector patch, such as that it is a NSAID and can't be mixed with other NSAID drugs like aspirin. My doctor also didn't inform me of this NSAID complication. I had taken 1 tablet aspirin about 15 minutes before I applied the Flector patch. Within a half hour of applying the Flector patch I started to feel incredibly drowsy, week, some pressure by my sternum. By the time it was one hour after applying the Flector patch, I felt like I could have had 3 or 4 beers, so exhausted, even numbness/jelly feeling in my arms (from below the elbow) and in my throat (a tightness in the middle of my throat). I looked online and found German and English information about Flector patch and found that it was a NSAID and should not be taken with aspirin or other NSAID drugs. I removed the Flector patch, wiped the area on my neck, and a half hour after that took a shower to wash better.\nI still feel poorly and I'm afraid to go to sleep after seeing the risks of combining NSAID drugs. Am I in any danger? I had not taken aspirin for 9 months before this, and no medications of any kind, just multivitamins, herbal tea and throat lozenges.

You are wanting to subject him to countless unnecessary tests and pain before getting help! Depression can be manged, he also sounds very scared of life. Think about it it is time for him to be on his own, legally he is an adult. Mental issues can and do cause all kinds of physical problems, I know because I have had them.

I played volleyball through college and have surfed my whole life. On top of that I work out and used to practice martial arts. All in all, I was always active and always in shape. Now, I can hardly do any of the activities I used to enjoy. My back hurts so bad I can't play volleyball or most sports. My knees have started to ache which makes it difficult to surf and I have shooting pain from my shoulder to my wrist which makes it hard to do just about anything that requires hands.\n\nMy back pain started 2 years ago, I was playing basketball and I turned for a pass and something happened. I can't recall if it was a pop or what, but it was definitely something that initiated the pain. From my research and countless doctors it appears to be a psoas injury. However, 2 years of stretching, icing, physical therapy, massage therapy and chiropractors have yielded NO results. I'm not nearly active as I was and yet my body keeps getting worse. My back hurts the worst now a days when I drive. If I drive for more then 20 minutes without having a bunch of pillows to sit on the pain quickly becomes unbearable. It also hurts really bad spiking in volleyball, something about the torque like movement on my lower left back or psoas or whatever it is.\n\nOn top of that I've started to recently experience knee pain which hurts walking, running, biking, surfing, etc...it's been on going for about 3 months. I stretch every day for all the muscles around the knee and have surfed a LOT less than normal, but to no avail.\n\nMy shoulder pain has been on and off for probably 5 years, I understand this is probably due to volleyball and probably some kind of nerve thing but my doctor said it's tennis elbow and to buy a brace which I think they pulled out of nowhere. Recently this has been getting far worse. My shoulder hurts, my wrist hurts my hand hurts and my elbow hurts worst of all. Very sharp pain that I can push through but extreme discomfort.\n\nI have no idea what's going on. I'm 5'10 about 170 lbs with very very low body fat. I'm in shape still as I still workout and exercise when I'm not in too much pain. I've had injuries before and strained muscles but these are way longer and persistent than anything I've experienced. I'm open to ANY advice you might have, I will be trying accupuncture soon, next step will be some voodoo doctors from Madagascar (not really, but I'm getting desperate).\n\nThank you in advance and if there is any more info that would help you advise me, don't hesitate to ask.","like_count":"0","tags":["Knee Pain","Chronic Pain","Neck Pain","Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: 23 going on 85 - never ending pain.","resp_content":"u need to see the doc there is no way an internet group can dx u\n"},{"author":"peonygirl1","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: 23 going on 85 - never ending pain.","resp_content":"Hi, I encourage you to seek help with pain management Drs. Their knowledge of what is causing your issues most likely will be an advantage. Your description of the twisting movement and your sensation presents so much like how my health issues started. Many years and more symptoms kept evolving and the pain changed how I could live my life. It ended up being a disc problem (herniated) with major surgery (fusion) L3, L4, L5 and S1 etc. I suggest a nerve conduction test so you will know how or if your spinal cord and discs are involved. This knowledge might very well help you to keep any further damage in check which might give you a better chance for a better quality of life. If your body is in pain it is telling you it needs help! I sure hope you will seek the expertise of a neurologist their skills just might keep you from a \"new normal\" lifestyle. Really persue this as your lifestyle depends on a correct diagnoses. You might want to go to medical websites that can offer many insights in your search for answers. I sure wish you the very best of luck and encourage you to fight for your health.

Also it happens sometimes when I turn my left leg while keeping my foot straight. Several weeks ago, I was at a friend's house in his studio basement, and when I went up the stairs to grab some coffee (late night recording session) I got this stabbing pain in my left knee so bad I couldn't make it up the stairs!

I tried putting my foot on the stair normally and stabbing pain again. Turn left foot outward as much as possible, step up, no pain? All of this has been explained numerous times to my Primary and the Orthopedists, but they seem to just tune that incident on the stairs out as a fluke that means nothing to their diagnosis... which as of today, they have none.\n\nThe Drs and Orthopedists have taken several X-Rays of my knee.

I couldn't breath because every single breath cause me pain. At that time my family took me to the emergency, and my pain went away as I sleep on the brancart.\nI had 26 degrees scoliosis thoracalis which i had known since 3 months ago, accidentally. 3 months ago, I went to hospital because my right thumb felt pain, radiated to the upper arm. ENMG shows nothings wrong so I did rontgent on cervical, and the doctor suspicious of hernia nucleus pulposus on my cervical. But the neurologist said its nothing and suggested me to see orthopaedist to consult about the scoliosis. I did and the doctor said its okay, I just need to swim regularly. Three months has passed and I had the attack. I thought it happened because of the scoliosis, but apparently the doctor said scoliosis will not give me those symptoms. Seeing the rontgent he suggested to do MRI and it showed nothings wrong, so the doctor said it could be just muscular spasm.\nBack to one year ago, I had hospitalized due to headache and vomit. I had pain around my neck too. And the doctor said the same, it was caused by muscular spasm and told me to swim regularly.\nI was grateful, truly, because I was afraid and thought about the worst that could happen. But still, the cause remains unknown and I doubt this will be the last time I will have this pain.\nI wish you could help me to find out what caused my symptoms because truthfully i'm not satisfied with these muscular spasm thing.

I am writing this to vent and because it may be that someone has suggestions on what to do or what's happening (if you bother to read this will) ... At the beginning of March I had a \"wrick\" feeling on my back as I swept my room. At that moment I did not cared that much and I continued to clean the house ... I had already had one or another situation like that and as it always was resolved quickly, I did not bother ...\n\nFor some years before, I was having mild pain in that same low back when I was sitting for some time In the same position, in walking, stopping and walking again, etc. But nothing that worsened my quality of life, so I always ignored. In fact, on the same day of the \"wrick\", I ended up doing (stupidly) also a giant walk, in a course full of ascents and descents. I continued to make efforts, carrying loads of shopping, traveling bags and backpacks (as I have always done since I studied at university, often stupidly ignoring buses and making unnecessary efforts) ... Until a couple of weeks after that \"wrick\", with the lumbar spine constantly sore, I felt pain radiating from my legs as I rose from the table after supper. I was scared and went to the hospital the next day. They dispatched me with painkillers and anti-inflammatories that I could barely take because they were causing me dizziness and tummy aches. I decided to go to a neurosurgeon who prescribed new medication (two painkillers, a stomach protection and a small dose of injectable cortisone) and asked me to do an MRI scan of the lumbar spine.\n\nAs a result, the L5-SI disc was somewhat dehydrated and had a small herniation / protrusion touching the sciatic nerve, everything else was normal. The doctor said it was nothing special, that I might have occasional pains from now on, but that in time, after this accute phase, Ishould stay close to the state I was before this incident. He told me to avoid weights, bad postures and wait during some time. In this consultation I also complained of a feeling of pressure in the left arm (I was only able to subside this sensation if I pressed/made strength in the fist) that I started to have when taking the medication, but he did not care ... However, this sensation of pressure became a sensation of constant burning through the left arm (especially between the wrist and the elbow, the focus of pain sometimes moves to the lower arm, shoulder... it changes from time to time). Then the right arm joined the party, although this one only gives me intermittent. I do not feel any weakness, the pain is indifferent to the activity or resting of the arms.\n\nIn the middle I began to experience facial and cervical pains due to temporomandibular dysfunction - the two discs of the joint go where they should not. I went to a specialist who made sure to reassure me after palpation and said that it is banal, that it is only due to dental malocclusion - she's almost sure using braces or a drip will solve the problem, I'm about to go to a doctor for that ...\n\nDue to the persistent pain in the left arm and the pain in the lumbar and legs not evolving, I decided to return to the neurosurgeon and to visit another one to have a second opinion (this one also did not find my magnetic resonance to the lumbar to be anything that serious) and he asked me to to perform an electromyography in order to detect irradiated cervical lesions to the arms, nervous system problems and an early degenerative tendency of multiple discs of the spine. Result: everything normal. Both doctors agreed to take a drug called Lyrica (for neuropathic pain) for a month to see if the arm improved. In relation to the lumbar, they say to wait a few more months because it is likely to improve - although they emphasize that there is always a chance of being operated on later. This post should be as chaotic as my body is, but I informed the doctors of all the problems, how and when they came up, etc ... including the question of the jaw. By normal electromyography, illnesses such as multiple sclerosis have likely been ruled out ... I am going to have a resonance also to the cervical, although by electromyography it should be okay in this part of the back, acorrding to the doctors.\n\nI do not understand what's going on and I'm so afraid it's something systemic or immune like I am to simply stick with these pains, like that, forever. I'm starting to get desperate, it's been more than two months since it all started ... And I do not understand what the hell is going on with my arms. If it could be circulation, bones (rheumatism / arthritis, I already had a fracture in the arm, another in the wrist and another in the left hand when I was younger), muscles ... I do not know which experts to go, I do not know anything!

I was in a meeting in a conference room which was a little cool, around 65 degrees. I was wearing snug but comfortable sneakers. After sitting for about 2 hours, we took a break, I stepped outside for a smoke and started feeling a painful itching sensation in my left little toe on the way back to the conference room. The meeting lasted about another 1.5 hours and the sensation seemed to get a little worse over that time. After the meeting, I started to feel it worsen dramatically as I was walking. Upon arriving home and removing shoes and socks, I noticed that the toe was swollen and red. There was no blister evident at that time. Today in the shower I cleaned and massaged it slightly, feeling no pain while doing that. Afterwards the pain and redness returned. Throughout my day I did walk a bit, and by the time I was on my way home I was almost in tears with the pain. My walk has turned into an extreme limp, but I can still hobble around by favoring the inside of my foot. When I removed my footwear this evening, I realized that the swelling was extreme, it has become very painful to the touch, and there is a purple-ish blister in the crack on the underside of the toe (see pic). The entire toe feels quite hard to the touch and it is now a constant shooting and unbearable pain which almost feels like the toe wants to burst. I have been taking OTC Naproxen Sodium throughout the day to counteract which does dull, but does not eliminate the pain.\n\nI realize that I am likely going to have to see a professional to have the problem diagnosed, however I am short Medical Coverage and not financially able to cover medical bills which will ensue. I am hoping for a little guidance towards possible diagnoses and home remedies that might help to ease the pain and hopefully cure the problem.

The best thing to do is if you have chronic pain is to discuss this with your primary doctor first, who may recommend an appropriate specialist to treat your condition. We can share what has worked for us and details about our own conditions, but can not advise you what you should do to relief your pain other than see your doctor. Once you have seen your doctor or doctor(s), then you can come back and post some specific questions that we may be able to answer.\n\nI have been managing moderate to severe chronic pain for over 40 years - since my late teens. I was born with a spinal defect called hyperkyphosis, which is where the middle (thoracic) section of my spine is curved outward too much. I have severe osteoarthritis in my spine and entire body and had to have both hips replaced last year (right in June and left in November) and am thrilled with those results. I have stenosis at all levels, a total of 8 herniated discs, DDD with some discs completely gone, bone spurs at each level of my spine and my vertebrae T12 and L1 are lying against each other on their sides with a broad based herniated disc between them.. I had to stop working at age 51, applied for SSD and was approved in 2 months due to the solid medical evidence. I do what I can to help in and around the house, but do spend a lot of time in my recliner.\n\nI am allergic to all opiate pain medication so can only take muscle relaxers and enteric coated aspirin. I have seen probably dozens of various spine specialists and all say that there is no surgery that could help me. I've tried steroid injections and rhizotomies (ablations) but the results are temporary - 6 months at the most - and symptoms return worse than before. I get a chiropractic adjustment about once per month and two neurosurgeons have told me that they are helping to keep me out of a wheel chair right now.\n\nI share all this to say that when I reply in a post that I understand, I truly do and live with this daily. I rely mostly on my faith and family to help me focus on the blessings that are in my life.\n\nBlessings,\n-Dave","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: TO ALL POSTING HERE WITH CHRONIC PAIN","resp_content":"Hi Dave.

However, I am left with my legs feeling extremely weak and painful. It is very odd and hard to explain. At best my legs feel kind of weak and achy. At which time I will start to exercise a bit, and by a bit I just mean short walks. The result of a few walks is that my legs get incredibly sore like as if I have climbed a mountain, not walked around the block.

He is a great guy, but has kind of said he just doesn't know anymore.\n\nI almost feel like my pain is muscular, as it so exacerbated by exercise. Once I have flared up it takes days, maybe even weeks to settle back down. But as I am continuing to work full time I never really get things to settle down.

I had a torn rotator cuff, punched back my first few ribs (which caused periodic severe neck pain and pain radiating down my normal arm) and a \"sprained knee.\" My chest pain was also located just off my sternum, with the symptoms you subscribe...first on one side for months and then it switched to the other side. The pain often started if I leaned forward to pick up shoes on the floor or get out of a chair. It was so severe I would gasp and be unable to speak when someone asked me what was wrong. Applying pressure until the pain stopped seemed to be the only way to stop it. My upper abdomen was also sore and at one point I thought I had gallstones it was so severe. This condition is called Costochondritis, which it sounds like you have too. It is caused by inflammation where the ribs and cartilage that connects the ribs to the sternum come together. Although trauma can cause it many other things can too. I know it's associated with psoriatic or ankylosing arthritis, fibromyalgia, problems with the heart or lungs, certain viral or fungal or bacterial infections . I also know it's associated with anxiety and panic attacks but ***you should see a doctor to get to the bottom of it... Hope this helps.

Two back surgeries, last was 4 yrs ago, waited way too long and now have severe damage to sciatic nerves (Numbness, shooting pains, etc). Could barely walk for awhile. It has been a long hard road but I will say exercise has been a major proponent of my recovery. I now walk/jog 3 miles about 5 days a week. It started in desparation, giving in to pain, lying in bed half the time, fantasizing about death. Read a book about Navy SEALS and began really researching; was so impressed with their toughness and the idea that their mental toughness exceeded even their physical abilities, and the mindset of never quitting no matter what. I got myself pumped up and had one of those \"I'VE HAD IT!\" moments; I proclaimed that I would run again. It was grueling, I have fallen on my face. I learned not to try in public parks. Actually had people stop me and ask if I was ok... LOL. I laughingly began to call it controlled stumbling.\nI now can run about half of the 3-3.5 miles course that I run on a private ranch road. Its not always easy, many times I have to listen to something motivational (Marcus Luttrell or someone like that giving a speech) to get going. I still have bad days that are overwhelming, but the good days are steadily increasing, my pain med usage is half or less what it was, and I feel like I am at least fighting the pain and not just giving up.\nI dont know if this helps, I have never posted anything like this online, but just happened to see your post and looks like we may have had similar experiences. Please don't give up... pray, exercise, and FIGHT!\nDon't know if you are a religious person, but I have been all my life... However I must admit that I felt like God had abandoned me. But coming out of the fog of depression and the dark valley I have been in for 7 yrs now, I can see some things about life clearer than ever. I encourage you to pray. Not trying to sound preachy, just telling you what has helped me.\n(Sorry so wordy, didn't mean to write that much!)\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Lumbar Surgery","resp_content":"I can attest to that but with different surgeries, joint replacement.

I have (mild) asthma and allergies. I take birth control, a steroid inhaler, an allergy pill, and nasal spray. I have an average weight, and I walk a few miles everyday and do yoga once in a while.\n\nOne night in November, I suddenly got severe chest pains on my left side. They stopped after a few minutes. A few weeks later, I had a cardiologist appt and the cardiologist said I have a healthy heart with a few premature heart beats. But it wasn't even close to the level they would worry about. I did mention the chest pains to her, but she not seem fazed about it. The chest pains continued but not nearly as severe as the first time. More like a throbbing or achy feeling. Sometimes I would get the chest pains when I was stressed, like when my sister screamed. I called the cardiologist's office just to get a confirmation that my chest pains were normal, and the person on the phone said it sounds like muscle pain and to take Advil or Ibuprofen. A month later, I moved to Germany for my gap semester. The chest pains were still coming, and radiated more into my right side, my ribs, and my back. The doctor, checking me very quickly, prescribed physical therapy. I went and it hurt a lot in places I don't think it was supposed to hurt. Throughout my first 3 months here, it will hurt for a few days, then go away for a week. I do not notice a pattern for it. So I do not know if physical therapy actually helped, or if it was just going away like it comes and goes. Well, I've been having them again and the doctor prescribed me a lot more physical therapy and gymnastics exercises. But I have been reluctant to go because the insurance I am provided with is a limited amount of money and I do not have enough money on it to do all of the physical therapy appts. So I or my host family would pay out of pocket.\n\nWhat I want to know is, what does this sound like it is?

You were absolutely correct to see the cardiologist however. Being a paramedic I know that women and diabetics can experience myocardial pain in different ways than the standard chest pain and radiation of the pain down the left arm. I would try alternating heat and ice on it when it comes on. If one feels better stick with that. Just try 20 min at a time with each when alternating. This helps for minor pain and reduces swelling with the cold. My physician told me to do that but I already knew that anyway from my medical background. Do you have any imaging studies? Like I said I am NOT a doctor but this may help you. NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, naproxen, etc. Your doctor may even give you stronger ones but they need a prescription, well at least here they do.

It was late in the game and I kept playing, but as the adrenaline wore off afterwards, I realized I had significant pain and limited mobility in my shoulder, as well as weakness in my arm. The top of my shoulder (above the collarbone) was bulging. I'm pretty certain there was no dislocation, unless it popped out and back in instantaneously without me noticing. I figured I'd had a light shoulder separation.\n\nI wore a sling and regularly iced and taped up the shoulder, giving it support. I returned to soccer a few weeks later after most of the pain had stopped, playing only with it heavily taped and supported. Over the next month or two, it gradually got better to the point where I barely noticed it and stopped using the sling, but the improvement seems to have stalled out since. I had planned to do some mobility/strengthening exercises to keep helping it along, but I read that you shouldn't do any such exercises until pain is completely gone, and I still haven't reached that point, now five months after the fall.\n\nCurrently, any movement that opens the shoulder wide (reaching overhead or behind me, any throwing motion) brings some pain and shows my mobility is still limited. Putting weight on the hand or elbow to that side also brings some light pain, and it remains uncomfortable to lie down on that side. I can also feel tightness around the joint (front, back and side), and I still have a slight but noticeable bulge above the collarbone.\n\nI don't know what to do next to aid the healing process. Are there exercises, movements or massages I can try that would help? Should I be taking anti-inflammatories? Should I go back to icing heavily and keeping it immobile and in a sling at all times? If so, how would I even know when it's OK to stop using the sling?\n\nThe injury never struck me as something significant enough that would require an MRI, let alone surgery, but now that the recovery has stalled, I'm worried that might be necessary. I would very much like to avoid surgery, both because of expense and the lengthy recovery that would come with it.\n\nI'm 25 and have never had a significant sports injury despite skiing and playing soccer my whole life. I did play baseball for a long time and I used to pitch, but I never had any major shoulder issue.\n\nAny guidance you can provide would be a huge help.

It is the fear of the horror called withdrawal.

I understand the misconceptions so many people have about severe & chronic pain & the fact opioids can end up being the only thing left between any quality of life and death.\nCertainly, there ARE people faking pain to obtain prescription pain meds but that, in what I've gathered from really reading your posts, is not your case.\nUS government agencies have taken control of the way prescribed pain meds are allowed. New \"guidelines\" have lowered the recommended daily morphine jumping off point at, it could have changed,but last time something came across my desk, the amount was 80mgs per day. It seems I may have heard 120mgs total daily most recently. US DEA & CDC have given the pharmacist a much bigger roll in deciding whether a prescription will be filled according to the pharmacist's mindset or opinion. Since the new guidelines came out, doctors have suddenly cut folks medication in half or worse. Some Dr's have dismissed patients completely, sent them out to specialists who treat them like common drug addicts. People are suffering because of the sudden, quick tapering of pain meds that in many cases they've taken for decades.\nIn my opinion it is both travesty & tragedy. A national disaster.\n\nTo the person imagining that the op of this thread is going to a \"pill Mill\", idk where you've been but there ARE NO pill mills in USA. Perhaps that exists in the UK but I'm thinking not.\n\nI'd recommend finding a chronic pain support group which is not what you're finding here. Type \"online support groups of severe chronic pain sufferers\" into your website browser search bar. I think you'll find a much better fit there. You can try looking just for folks in the UK. I really think the international facebook group is good. It's mostly USA, UK & Canada. It might do you some good to hear of what people in US are dealing with. Def a different perspective.\n\nThere's negative attitudes out there but usually those types are quickly out numbered in a real support group. Don't get me wrong,they're not a bunch of pushovers who believe every word any one says but you are legitimate and I for one believe you and hope you get to a point where you can actually enjoy life again.\n1\nReply\nthodav84\nover 3 years ago\nThank you for your support, my specialist is trying to get me enrolled onto a residential pain management course and in the mean time I'm going into hospital so they can try an Epidural because I don't want to continue taking such high doses of pain killers.

I can attest to that fact that taking a break from opioids can be very beneficial. I have had to take several in my lifetime.

I went off for 90 days and went through many hospitalizations because of an under laying diagnosed neurological illness. Anyway giving your body a chance to readjust helps a great deal. Have you tried CBT, Cognitive Behavior Therapy. It has help me a great deal. Finding ways to keep your thoughts positive is difficult but necessary. Negativity feeds your pain, pain feeds negativity.

Talk with your doctor about reducing the time period between the meds or to piggy back them so your body is getting something 24 hours a day. My doctor worked with me so that if the normal dose was every 6 hours I would take my next dose at 4 hours. Then he would give me something at a lower dose that I could take between the doses.

I have been on pain meds for about 20 years. I will say fetinal patch being the worst. It despences into your system with either a overload or not enough. Many things affect this. Heat, hot showers, your body temp and being out side in heat. The worst side affect was sweating. Morphine did not help at all. Most meds that I took never worked for the maximum time allotted. My life revolved around watching the clock waiting to be able to take my next dosage. I finally was put on methadone and it has saved my life. I no longer have to watch the clock for the next dosage. I did not feel all doped up. I was hesitant to take it for I associated it with herion addiction. It worked for pain better than any pain med I have been on and I have been on too many to list.

I am not an expert or medical specialist but I do know pain. I have had orthopedic arthritis, psyudoarthrosis and nerve pain all my life from a disability. I find the best way to approach my pain is to lean into it. In other words treat before it gets too big. Do not increase dosages because they will eventually fail. Pain meds mostly depress you as well. A non-narcotic antidepressant can do well to give you a lift to approach this huge undertaking. (I use Nortriptyline) Look at things you can control. For instance, a ice bag is great for bone pain and swollen joints. Meditation is great for identifying where and what hurts and to control your perception of the pain. You can help yourself. I know this sounds brutal but this is your suffering to figure out. Doctors don't know much but they are getting better. Seeing a good pain therapist is really good for figuring out the less obvious reasons for your pain. Perception is everything. A traumatic experience or hidden psychic pain can hinder your perception of your pain. Once you can look at your pain clearly, free of emotional context, you can then describe the pain better to the doctors and see for yourself what you are up against. Don't let people that are hostile be around you. Be kind to yourself. Personal hugs and strokes do a lot to relax your stress and anger over your situation. It helps to have love ones that support you and do not cater to your pain. You have the power. Remember pain by itself is just pain. If you pay attention it will pass. Reward yourself for your discipline, patience and wisdom. Also, chocolate helps!

Worse, your \"quality of life\" is gone-destroyed by numerous surgeries that were obviously unsuccessful, along with your stroke, bladder failure, seizures, heart surgery and so on and so forth.\nYou mention that no DX exists, which I find rather puzzling.\nOver and beyond the \"usual crew\" of Specialists you've seen-have any been of the \"Infectious Disease\" variety?\nI ask because this Specialty is often overlooked, yet many of your symptoms and pain fall within the category of vector born illness.\nChronic Lyme comes to mind-and contrary to the CDC, Web MD and other venues of \"expertise,\" it is far more common than officially stated.\nIn addition, less than 40% of infected individuals develop a \"Bulls Eye\" rash, and in fact, many are completely asymptomatic from the start.\nNor are all Lyme infections caused by the deer tick alone, as numerous \"biting bugs\" have now been found to carry the bacteria.\nUndiagnosed, Lyme can and does attack the heart, kidneys, brain, spine, soft tissue, eyes, motor skills and memory. It can also cause permanent neuropathy and aggressive arthritis.\nDemand a Lyme Test if you've never had one, and if negative, demand a second. The life cycle of the Lyme nymph goes through stages in your system-i.e., you can test negative-yet be positive.\nEnsure your blood tests screen for a variety of vector born illnesses-not just Lyme.\nFrom a personal stand-point, I too find morphine along with nearly every narcotic on the market of little use in reducing my pain.\nAnd like you- a medication will \"somewhat work\" for a week to maybe a month-then \"poof\"-it will lose all pain reduction potency. And soooooo....my Board Certified Pain Specialist tries something else, again and again and again.\nWhere you and I differ however-is my stubborn ( and possibly stupid) refusal to raise the potency of my \"medication(s) of the month\" above a certian dosage.\nThere's no question that an intractable pain patient, (or any patient on long-term pain medication) will indeed need to \"tritate up\" the dosage of their medications every so often.\nBut your dosages are so high, they appear to be \"feeding the fire\" of your pain....something I'm very wary of.\nIt's a well known phenomena-one only you can control and change.\nThere are as many treatments for your horrific pain as there are starfish in the sea.

It started as my tail bone when i fell really hard directly on it, this transitioned to lower back pain and at this point i began going to physio because my posture was terrible and i had to sit out a lot in basketball because it would hurt to walk. Once my lower back pain started to go away i began to get an achy pain on the left side of my chest around my third and forth rib but only when walking for long periods of time. When i would try and stretch out my rib cage it would feel extremely tight and tender. This pain then started to occur every day started about a year and a half ago so i went to the doctor and got and x ray and nothing was wrong. He said it was probably just a muscle strain and that i should just take muscle pain medications. 10 months after that i started seeing an active release therapist because the pain spread all around my chest and the middle of my back. Some times throughout the day i would get sharp stabbing pains in my chest and awful knots all in my shoulder blades and down my spin. And sometimes when i would run my chest muscles would randomly contract and i would be extremely short of breath and could only take short quick ones. The painful spot on my rips feels like a bruise to touch. Also, when i lean forwards and backwards slightly my ribs on the left side pop back and forth. I cant take a deep breath without my whole rib cage hurting and feeling restricted. Also when i suck my stomach in you can see that the left side sticks out more than the right. The active release therapist discovered that I had a rib out of place for about a year and all the muscles around it had adjusted to that position so apparently the muscles are all messed up around that spot. Sorry im all over the place I just have alot to say but if anyone has any answers or comments that would be great. From doing research on every single symptom that occurs, almost every result points to slipping rib syndrome but im not sure if that its way more serious than what im facing.","like_count":"0","tags":["Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Back and Chest pain","resp_content":"go to the doctor no dxs here\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/5822/back-and-chest-pain"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Compartment Syndrome","post_content":"Hi, anyone have this condition, had the surgery to release the compartments in legs, then returned a few months later","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/5727/compartment-syndrome"},{"post":{"author":"dmt2017","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Need a cortizone shot from a dr in prescott az...help!","post_content":"Looking for a referall to a dr that can administer a cortizone shot in prescott az, on a cash basis.

There are 3 types of migraines and you need to talk with your doctor. These things are terrible to get and to live with. Try putting a ice pack over your right eye. Take a hot shower or bath.

I had foot surgery and was incapacited with a foot cast. To get around I was given crutches and had used the crutches for 2 months before I graduated to the walking boot. Due to the cast, the uncomfortable posture, and sleeping in bed with a huge cast, my spine and whole body was mis-aligned. I first went to a chiropractor who manipulated and adjusted me into proper alignment. But I was having numbness in my left arm all the way down to the ring finger and little finger. Tingling, numbness in the arm, and a \"crick\" in the neck.\nI went back to the chiropractor for a 2nd adjustment, and again it re-aligned my spine...but did not relieve the pain. I continued to read up on this condition, and thought it was ulnar nerve problems. I decided to see an Osteopathic physician which turned out great decision. He determined that the nerve which exits the C-6 to C-8 vertebrae area and passes thru the shoulder and down into the elbow was not \"pinched\" by the vertebrae, but constricted due to the muscles in the neck-shoulder area. Called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. The Osteopathic physician's method of adjustment was tender and uses muscle resistance to re-align the area as compared to the Chiropracters violent and sudden movement. Plus the Osteopath took much more time to actually diagnose the problem.\nIt has taken a visit once a month for the past 3 months to resolve. And a nerve takes up to 5-6 months or possibly 1 year to re-generate the feeling. Also I lost strength in the forearm and dexterity in the fingers by about 75% so I am back at the gym lifting weights to strengthen the forearm. The strength and dexterity in each finger is tested by squeezing a blue racketball throughout the day until the grip strength returns.\nAlthough this was not life-threatening, it would be un-forseeable to have known that the use of crutches would have caused so much mis-alignment of my body and these subsequent issue.","like_count":"0","tags":["Chronic Pain","Neck Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome-pinched nerve","resp_content":"Now you know why you should never see a chiropractor.

He had an MRI which showed no bulging or slipped discs but has continued to be in a lot of pain. He had a few months off work while waiting for an MRI at their request because his pain was too intense to handle normal work and for their own health and safety policies.

He is relatively fit and used to go to the gym on a regular basis. He has not being going to the gym for a while but has followed every bit of advice from the Physio in regards to exercises and strengthening. He was told at one point that it was muscle pain (his psoas muscle needing strengthening) and has also been told that it could be scheuermanns disease (oddly shaped vertebrae) . He was referred to the pain team who have also tried to help with pain management and has been going to work based counselling (not for the pain, but for tools around how to efficiently use your time etc).\n\nHe went to see a physiotherapist privately who suggested that while he still had joint tightness and significant pain, that he might be suffering with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. They suggested that he needs to break the pain loop and that he needs to do gentle enough exercise so as to not hurt the area and reaffirm the pain loop. We've now bought an exercise bike that he's been using gently.

For at least 8 years now I have had back pain that has gotten too much to bare. The main issue is my lower back and feels like a slipped disc pressing on a nerve, but it doesnt go down my leg. It feels like the left and right sides of the lowest part of my spine. It gets so bad sometimes that I have to lean my body to the left because I cant straighten it out without severe pain. This pain comes and goes and has no real rhyme or reason. Sometimes its when I first wake up, other times its in the middle of the day like right now. The other pain happens in the middle of my back and seems to come when I have been standing too long. This also is on the left and right of the spine in the middle of my back. This pain also comes and goes, but will almost always happen in I have done some sort of project where I have been standing for awhile. This one might have a lot to do with being out of shape. I am a 5'11\" male, 42 years old, and about 228 last time I was weighed. I am currently exercising and eating better to get this weight down in hopes it alleviates some of the pain, and just to be in better shape. But I doubt the disc issue will be resolved just by getting in shape, but might improve.\n\nI dont have a primary doctor at the moment, but I have called the local orthopedic surgeons office in hopes of getting some help. I know I should have gotten some help for this a long time ago, but there is a reason why Id rather not get into. My question is this. If it is indeed a slipped/ herniated disc will it show up in an MRI if the disc isnt slipped when they do it? Is there some other sign that will show that the doctor will be able to verify? I am 99% sure its slipping based on the way it feels like its pinching a nerve, but have read that this usually also causes shooting pains down the leg, which is not the case with me.\n\nAnyway I thought I would post here for any advice or info someone might have.

How long after the injections did the spasming start? Any numbness? Four years ago I was given sacral nerve treatment of some sort. A block or something. Afterwards, when I tried to stand I couldn't because my legs were completely numb. I was helped to a chair in the nurses lounge area to wait for the numbness to go away. BTW, I'd had this treatment done 3 times a couple years earlier with the exact same numbness after each. So when this was brought up by the PM dr I was seeing at the time I told him of the reaction I'd had previously. It'll be different this time. My husband told me not to have the procedure.\nBecause of the pressure I felt from the PM staff I went ahead & did it.....So I'm sitting there waiting and hoping to walk out of there soon when I felt something wet on my skirt. I looked down to see I was sitting in a puddle of my own urine. The nurses helped me into a pair of scrubs, got me cleaned up, washed out my skirt and hung it to dry. I was put in a new chair. About 10 minutes after that a slow, deep contraction coming from what felt like someplace deep within the sacral nerve. That's when the spasms started. They felt exactly like the back labor contractions I'd had 30 plus years before(without benefit of epidural). I'm talking horrific. Something was wrong. Big time.\nMy Dr called his more experienced partner who said he'd had one just like mine the week before! I was told an ambulance was about to be called to take me to the hospital for IV pain meds. That's when my husband walked in and he was pissed. No ambulance he said, I'll drive her to the hospital. Oh jesus. I was put in his car with a note from the Dr and his phone numbers etc. The drive to the ED was unbelievable. Worse, when I got there I was treated like a drug addict. It was almost an hour before the ED dr talked to my Dr. I thought I was gonna die. Finally, I was given a tiny bit of demerol or something that barely took the edge off. My husband went outside and dialed the pain Dr explaining what wasn't happening for me. The pain Dr called the ED and after another conversation with the ED dr, I was given appropriate meds and started to feel better very quickly. A total nightmare.\n\nYes, you should tell your doc.

Ever since for the past 5 months it has not fully gone away. Every morning it starts off very dull and thought out the day is varies on intensity, some days are worse than other and sometimes it remains very tolerable.\n\nMy first visit to my doctor was for a regular physical and some blood test, everything was good; the only thing was that my liver enzymes were a little elevated, but overall there was nothing alarming. The Doctor gave me ibuprofen to alleviate the pain, after taking them for 4 days I stopped since it was no working.\n\nI took a CT SCAN w/o contrast to the brain, again nothing irregular, for most part of April, I went to two different chiropractors thinking it was my neck/back that was pinching a nerve causing pain to the head, they even worked on my jaw muscles to see if anything was wrong in that area. After the month of April was over I figured I had to find another explanation because nothing seen to make it better.\n\nI went to the dentist and they recommended me to use a mouth guard since there were sings of teeth grinding and jaw clinching, to this day I use them every night but that seems to not be the cause. Also went to get my eyes checked, but everything was good, although I was told that my eyes were very dry, so they prescribed FLUOROMETHOLONE 0.1% drops to take care of that, again; no signs that it caused the pain. I took them for two weeks and then moved on.\n\nWent back to my doctor, had another blood test, only to have the same results. I went on to take an MRI w/o contrast to the brain, and a few weeks later went to a Neurologist 06/01/2016. The MRI showed some “abnormalities of the posterior right periventricular white matter, representing a small area of “encephalomalacia/gliosis. The sequel of periventricular leukomalacia would be one possible etiology.” Based on that he prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE HCL- 10 MG TABLET, and FLURBIPROFEN- 50MG, those were for muscle/mood relaxing, and inflammatory pain reliever. He also recommended for me to see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor to see if the pain was caused by a possible sinusitis problem. As told; I went there, he he checked my mouth and inside my nostrils. There were no sign of any sinusitis and I was back to square one.\n\nIts been 5 moths now and I cant find any clue as to what can be causing this tension headaches. The pain varies as far as the location (sometimes is on top, side, back of the head). As far as the intensity of the pain, it is very random (some days are very intense and other are very mild/dull).\n\nOn 07/07/2016 I had and appointment with my Neurologist again for a month check-up. He did not help at all. I then started to learn/practice trigger therapy, with little results.\n\nOn 11/01/2016 went in for physical therapy, worked on strengthening my shoulders and neck area. After a month i was release by the doctor because I did not get better.\n\nPlease I don't know what to do or where to go.

Even basic and low impact cardio workouts like the stationary bike seem to create discomfort.\n\nI'm curious if others have had similar issues and how they've made out down the road after such an Injury?

Sometimes you will get no relief and surgery could introduce other problems. A lot of people do get good relief but back surgery is a serious option.

With your doctor's approval take the maximum dosage and do not expect relief for at least 2 weeks when the anti-inflamatory really begins to take effect. You may also get some additional anti-inflamatory benefits from a good fish oil supplement.\n\nI would also assume your doctor has suggested physical therapy? Sometimes strenghtening muscles and improving posture can provide substantial results. Also, review your activities through the day to see which ones aggravate your symptoms.\n\nIf you do end up with the final option of surgery, really do your homework on finding the best surgeon. Also, try to opt for the simpliest procedure.

I can honestly say that as far as pain goes, the only time I am pain free is when I take the Ambien and I go to sleep. That pretty much goes for my depression too. The only time I don't wish my suicide attempt had succeeded is when I am asleep. But they just switched me to Lexapro, and I am hoping maybe this time it will help.","resp_content":"Debra\nReply\nsurvivor68\nover 3 years ago\nI was told by my kidney doctor not to take meloxicam because it is another drug which is hurtful to kidneys.

SI joint dysfunction, three mildly herniated in neck, chronic muscle spasms, all made worse by fibro and vice versa.\nI've been critically hypothyroid for three plus years. Now I'm slightly hyper (last two months) because I was put on NatureThroid. I go through periods of 80lb weight gain / loss in 6 weeks, (yes you read that right) for no obvious reason, for 20 years. But my thyroid's always good when it happens and that's good enough for the VA. No need to check anything else (of course, the head of the VA pain clinic is a sexual predator and they know it, so I'm not expecting much.)\n\nMy problem, other than I have to get my medical treatment from a sub-par VA, is I also suffer from migraines and get rebound headaches. They're just as bad as migraines and I get them if I take more than three doses of pain meds per week (even just tylenol). I've been on (hydrocodone, naproxen, tylenol, toradol, motrin, asa; etc). Allergic to toradol, morphine, codiene, oxycodone (hydrocodone causes severe itching but it's what I use when it's that or eat a bullet.) When I get a rebound headache they can last for weeks, the longest has been a month.\n\nMy question is there any pain medication that doesn't cause rebound HA's? I'm already on neurontin, nortriptyline, and a few other \"not actually\" pain medications and they are not cutting it.\n\nI also can't take anything herbal or that touts itself as being natural (because, believe me, that doesn't mean it's safe.) I do take Osteo-Biflex.\n\nIt's getting to the point I can't do everyday activities like say, walk. I'm 45 and not going to be able to handle this much longer.

I was sure it was getting bigger if anything!\n\nEventually I went to the doctor. I was given cream which he said had the antibiotic in it and to apply it etc etc.\nI did as told......

Was given another tube of cream which had a steroid in and a course of anti biotics.\nI completed the course, applied the cream..... Still, nothing changed.\n\nMonths later again and for some unknown reason I felt a pain in my foot. One that could only be compared to the feeling I had after being stung by the gnat.... The point of pain was on my instep and not the ankle though. I couldn't see anything like a cut, sting, etc! Over the following days the area became more tender, purple red in colour and then itchy!\nI went to the walk in centre and left with more cream. applied as told but no change.\nConcerned as the ankle and instep redness were both getting bigger and practically joining to be one big area rather than two.\nBack the doctors.\nThis time I was told it was dermatitis!!! Was given strong cream as he put it! A big tub o emulsifier and a referral was made to see a dermatologist.\n\nThe wait for an appt to land on my door step was 40 days they said!\nTwo weeks on, no better, infact so much worse! To theorist where my entire foot was red and swollen, it hurt to walk! And my skin felt tight. It was moving up my lower leg! And was seeping something!\nBack to the docs, I went to show him my foot and on doing so he saw for him self that my white sock was half damp with a wet Stain from where the area was. It hurt to pull the sock away from my skin which lokedredandroar. He saw this himself!!!!! He saw how swollen it was! He told me he'd try to hurry my Referral through for the dermatologist and also gave me another course of antibiotics as he assumed there was now a secondary infection perhaps!\n\nI left, im half way through this course of antibiotics! Still no appt arrived from the dermatologist! (FYI, ITS BEEN OVER 40 DAYS) AND WORSE STILL IS ITS GONE SO MUCH WORSE! And for some reason my other ankle has started doing the same hang.... Sudden on set of itchiness! Swollen, red, tender, AND NOW IM UNABLE TO WALK! It hurts far too much! My socks are soaking and it feels like my feet and legs have been burnt! They are scarily purple in colour! Massive in size, bumpy things have appeared and no amount of elevation helps very much! Not enuf to stand and walk to the kitchen!\n\nIm scared! Very!

I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, severe multi-level degenerative disc disease, arthritis and my SI joint is a mess. Over the years I've had physio, acupuncture and chiropractic treatment. I've been on many medications and had to retire early from work. In January, 2015 I found an excellent massage therapist who got me back on my feet. I was taking 240 mg of morphine SR daily. I tried to come off this a couple of years ago with no success. However, over the last two years I've been able to slowly wean myself off it. It's one of the hardest things I've had to do. I cut down by 15 mg a month. As I decreased the withdrawal symptoms got more severe. Right now I am seven days free of any morphine and still suffering bad withdrawal. It's been the hardest week of my life. Is it worth it? Absolutely! I know this will get better. I still live with back pain but I'm managing through massage, exercises, Pilates and walking. I could barely walk the length of myself and on a good day now I can walk over an hour or more. I have to do stretches and alternate heat and ice but I'm so grateful to get back walking.

I have a PCP, I saw him at the end of July beginning of August. I had severe right knee pain at my first appointment. I have since injured my left knee as well about a week into being down with my right knee. I had originally in 2009 (when I first started having BAD issues) gotten injured in a car/pedestrian accident that pinned me, by my knees, between the back of a smaller truck and the front of my parked Chevy Malibu. At this time I had to have 22 stitches placed in my lower left knee area with about 6 months recovery time. I saw an orthopedic dr. within a month or two of my accident in 2009. Since then I have been a very active mother to 2 beautiful children that keep me on my toes. I was NOT doing anything that I would consider strenuous. I was playing with my children on the floor of the living room, proceeded to stand up and got about half way from sitting in an Indian style position. When I stood up, I heard a loud popping/snapping sound and had immediate searing pain radiate through my ENTIRE leg. I am having similar symptoms in both knees some days one will be worse than the other. My question is this, I have an appointment with my Orthopedic dr. on November 16 of 2016 after weeks of begging my PCP and FINALLY getting an MRI approval after EIGHT weeks or harassing the staff to push it through and figure out what it is not approved. In order to receive the MRI I will need to straighten BOTH my legs for upwards of FORTY minutes. I told the doctor this was NOT possible unless he wants to consciously sedate me. He refuses to do this, so I am stuck waiting on the couch. I have been to the Emergency Room numerous times refusing pain medications and begging for treatment of my knees, some kind of relief, any kind of relief that isn't narcotic pain medications. To which the lovely doctors respond well, it isn't bad enough to have treated on an emergent basis BUT it is bad enough to prescribe you a wheelchair.

The brain has an amazing ability to institute protection and avoidance of movement in order to heal. Unfortunately, sometimes our brain has us protect and avoid even past the time that it takes for our body to heal from an injury (in your case, the car accident). This can lead a to multitude of issues with one being muscular inhibition. When a muscle is inhibited it does not work optimally to allow for movement and can lead to further injury of our tendons, bones, and ligaments.\n\nIn other words, this new injury could stem back to the accident and you may have had an underlying movement issue since that time. Knee’s can pop/crack for a variety of reasons and can be a sign of ligamentous/bony injury. However, it can also be a result of relatively mundane and non-worrisome factors such as gas escaping the joint space, or unique joint articulations. Whether or not the popping/snapping you heard was the result of the actual injury or other factors, there was definitely an underlying reason for why it occurred. Muscle imbalance, muscle weakness, muscular inhibition, and even flexibility issues can lead to an injury. You want to make sure that along with treating the injury itself you receive treatment for the cause of the injury, which is where the diagnostic skills of a Doctor of Physical Therapy may benefit you.\n\nI am currently a Doctor of Physical Therapy working on my residency to achieve a board certified specialty in orthopedics. At my clinic currently we see many patients who suffer from pain related to injuries both new and old. Many of these patient’s have stories similar to your own. Even if further medical intervention is eventually required, I would advocate that seeing a therapist would aid you in achieving your current goals and even help in diagnosing and treating your movement related issues. This would also be a good treatment option since undergoing MRI is impossible for you at the moment and may even help proceed with an MRI if necessary. I would also encourage you that often findings on MRI do not correlate with a person’s symptoms (Brinjikji et al. 2014), and that getting PT first can help save you thousands of dollars in the long run. As an added benefit, a PT can help you understand pain and aid in calming down the nervous system responsible for the pain you feel, whether you end up with further medical care or not. A Therapist will start by examining you and performing medical screening to evaluate the potential need for medical referral. He/she will then determine a differential diagnosis for your condition ending with a non patho-anatomic movement impairment diagnosis that will direct interventions/treatment.\n\nBecause of our extensive background and knowledge in human anatomy and biomechanics as they relate to movement; we have an advantage often times over a physician because we CAN find and help eliminate the cause (etiology) of the problem itself. They are trained to give a patho-anatomical diagnosis based on your symptoms or what they find on imaging with a basis in micro-biologics, whereas the Doctor of Physical Therapy will diagnose from a macro-biologic standpoint and pick appropriate interventions (manual techniques such as dry needling, manipulation/mobilization, soft tissue mobilization, neuro-muscular re-education, or specific exercises) to address your impairments with the overall goal of decreasing pain and improving function.\n\nObviously you have spent considerable time trying to get the bottom of this issue. As you have refused pain medication it would seem that you do not hold value in simply treating the “symptoms” but getting to and treating the root cause of the issue. In all 50 states, you can directly consult with a physical therapist without needing a referral from a physician. More information can be gleaned by going to the American Physical Therapy Association’s web site at www.apta.org and clicking on the “Information for Consumers” tab and using the “Find a PT” tool.\n\nI am so sorry that you are going through this and hope you will find relief soon no matter what the solution ends up being. If you have any further questions I would be happy to respond or help you find a Doctor of Physical Therapy in your area!\n\nJosh Jones PT, DPT, Cert.

I was hospitalized for days, bedridden for months, used a walker for months, went to PT for years and have tried everything and anything for pain relief.\n\nIt is now almost 6 years later, I'm 27 years old, and in unbelievable chronic, dehabilitating pain. I have immense trouble with mobility and strength and EVERYthing affects it. Driving hurts, sitting, standing, walking, lifting, pushing, pulling, writing, reaching... everything creates pain. I am living in a complete cloud of misery.\n\nFunny thing about it is this: I don't look like it! Or act like it! I am a chirpy, \"fit + healthy\" seeming, bubbly, hardworking girl. I don't mope around, I try not to complain or speak up too much about it. So when I do, whether its a new doctor or old- they aren't taking me serious! I know for a fact multiple doctors think I'm fine.. they say I'm young, I've \"recovered\". But I haven't and it is ruining my life.\n\nMy weekly schedule consists of acupuncture sessions, cranial sacral therapy, massage, grounding, restorative yoga, swim and have been in and out of physical therapy for years. I've tried so many types of therapy I don't even know what else is left. I have also seen so many specialists and doctors, I've given up. No matter what I do, I am in copious amounts of pain.\n\nOne exception- Once in a blue moon on a RAGING flare up, I will take half a pain killer. This is the only time I feel complete relief from pain. But, I'm scared of being a person that \"relies\" on pain killers, so I don't take them often. PLUS- there is such a bad connotation with \"young people\" and pain killers that doctors smirk at me if I even bring them up. I've been out of Hydrocodone for the past month and have had such horrible pain I can't go to work anymore, be active or do much at all.\n\nPain: My biggest issue these days in an excruciating sharp pain in between my shoulder blades in my upper back. My neck flares up and becomes a sharp pain up through my head. My entire upper back scar tissue is rock hard and full of knots. And now my right arm has become completely numb and/or will have sharp pains down through my palm and fingers. My right arm and right leg have uncontrollable spasms nightly at this point.\n\nI was told by a doctor that I have bone spurrs between C6 and C7. And I was also recently told by a massaeust that my shoulder blades are very misaligned and uneven. She said my right shoulder blade is low and sunken in while my left is bulging out. Perhaps these are the causing a nerve to be pinched and why my right arm is having so many issues?\n\nI need help as soon as possible. The pain has become so extreme, I honestly feel like I am dying. I need to figure out a solution, some sort of real relief, but no doctor \"cares\" or will listen to me because I'm just TOO YOUNG. Too young for surgery, shots, anything. I'm sorry but I am too young to feel like I am 100 years old and bedridden at 27 years old.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions- holistic, western, eastern, whatever.

And I am also very sorry that you have not found the best medical care providers to help you.\n\nAs a physical therapist, I would like to provide you with some perspective that I hope will be helpful to you in the management of your pain and in your recovery. At twenty seven years old, you have many years ahead of you, and it is important to manage your neck and back pain to provide you with the best quality of life and function possible.\n\nI am impressed with your motivation and dedication to healing. With a weekly schedule of acupuncture sessions, cranial sacral therapy, massage, grounding, restorative yoga and swim, and with periodic episodic physical therapy care over the years, and you have done an amazing job.\n\nI think it is encouraging that you can get complete relief from pain by using one half dosage of a pain killer. I am not advising this as a solution to the pain, but it should be a relatively good sign that if the source of the pain can be identified, then you have good potential to control the pain and to function normally. I am sure it is extremely frustrating to have such constant pain, but please don’t give up!\n\nI have twenty six years of experience working “hands-on” in an out-patient clinical setting, and with the majority of my patients having had neck and back issues. With more complicated and/or chronic neck and back pain issues, it is very important that you work with practitioners who will patiently listen to your history, and who will ask lots of questions and also perform a thorough physical examination. Every patient is different with regard to posture, neck and back movement, strength and other factors, and to be successful your plan of care must integrate all of these things.\n\nAs I’m sure you know - after being treated by many medical providers including physical therapists - each practitioner brings their own clinical perspective to your case. It is impossible to give you exact advice in a written response, and it is very important that you are evaluated by a physical therapist who has experience and expertise treating neck and back injuries.\n\nBased on your comments about experiencing “excruciating sharp pain in between your shoulder blades and your upper back to your head,” with “upper back scar tissue which is rock hard and full of knots,” your “right arm completely numb and/or will have sharp pains down through my palm and fingers,” your “right arm and right leg have uncontrollable spasms nightly,” and your “shoulder blades being uneven,” it is very important for your physical therapist to identify the source of your movement and postural impairment(s). Without knowing the cause, you may be treating symptoms rather than restoring normal movement and function - which is the answer to you getting better.\n\nIn addition, with having bone spurs diagnosed between C6 and C7, it will be important to rule out joint, bone and/or nerve impingement issues. If you were my patient, I would want to work with a neurologist and possibly a physiatrist and/or pain management physician along with your family physician to address or rule out these issues, and to coordinate a plan of care that integrates symptoms management along with a physical therapy plan of care that addresses movement impairment. Once the pain is under control and you can move normally, without placing strain on the involved areas, then the reason for the pain will not be there.\n\nAs another possibility, if the knots (most likely trigger point/ spasms in the muscles that have persisted over time) have not been specifically treated with manual therapy (soft tissue and joint mobilization and/or trigger point releases) and/or trigger point dry needling, these options should be considered. I often evaluate and treat neck and back patients who have tried many other treatment approaches and strategies, and it’s not until the trigger points are released that normal motion can be restored. Many times the trigger point patterns reside within muscles that are too deep to be released with traditional manual therapy/ massage, and trigger point dry needling is one strategy that can make a dramatic difference. This is not “accupuncture,” but an approach that uses acupuncture-sized needles inserted into the muscular trigger points to relax them. Thereafter improvements in strength, motion and function (as part of a comprehensive physical therapy plan of care) can be achieved.\n\nIf you do not know of a physical therapist who can take a holistic and comprehensive approach, the American Physical Therapy Association has a “Find a P.T.” service that may be helpful. I will provide the web address link. You can search for physical therapists by geography, with listings that show clinical experience and expertise. In addition, if you’d like to incorporate trigger point dry needling in your current plan of care, I will include a link from another referral services that lists physical therapists who are certified to perform trigger point dry needling as well.\n\nhttp://aptaapps.apta.org/findapt/default.aspx?UniqueKey=\n\nhttp://www.kinetacore.com/find-a-therapist/\n\nMy thoughts are with you. I have worked with many patients over the years with difficult neck and back problems, and I know how debilitating and frustrating the pain and disability can be. That being said, please keep your positive attitude, determination and hope. Finding the right patient care team - including a physical therapist - who can guide you through improving your motion and function while coordinating medical care among caring, dedicated and professional colleagues is the key.\n\nMy best to you,\n\nDarcy Higgins, PT\n\nPhysical Therapist\nt-Doctor of Physical Therapy Candidate, 2017\n1\n"},{"author":"brittwoody","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"Wow, Darcy thank you so much for taking the time to really read and listen to my story.

From there to C7 are bulging. I have not seen the radiology report, this is just me looking at the disc myself and Google. I did have my chiropractor look at it and he confirmed my thoughts. The nerve going to the right is getting cut off at the higher level. The lowers are cutting into the left. So I have pain going down both arms but more severely with my right.\nI've had chronic pain with this for 7 years. Seeking multiple forms of treatment. Most recently daily ibuprofen and bi-weekly therapeutic massage and chiro adjustments have kept things manageable. However this particular \"flare up\" has been over the top enough for me to go back to pain management. My quality of life has been severely impacted. Pain mgmt ordered the MRI.

Pain management also sees that as a good option. I've been to PT, two ortho Drs, two chiros, several massage therapists. I've tried narcotic pain meds, muscle relaxers (flexeril, skelaxin), ultram.

I don't have health insurance and am trying to delay a visit.\n\nI have been an active hiker for 3 years and am in my mid 30's. I normally have \"normal\" knee pain that comes with steep descents. It always goes away.\n\nOn a recent backpacking trip I had 50 pounds on my back. Just a few hours into the hike (and no mountains yet) I felt a sharp and concentrated pain in my left knee. It was not extremely painful, maybe 5 out of 10. As I'm looking down it would be in the left portion of the knee (so on the outer part of my leg). This occurred on a very regular step; nothing out of the ordinary. I think the pain began as my left foot hit touched the ground but I am not 100% positive.\n\nI had never felt this type of pain before at any time in my life.\n\nAs the day went on this pain became more general and less concentrated. I definitely felt the pain more with taking steps up steep terrain.\n\nMy knee ached that night, especially if my leg was not 100% straight.\n\nThe next day the ache came back shortly as I got into the hike. I soon found a good sturdy stick and this greatly aided me such that I felt little to no pain for the remainder of the trip.\n\nFast forward a week after the trip was over and I went on a day hike. Knee starts out fine but later in the day my left knee begins to ache (not concentrated). It seems to be related to my original injury.\n\nThat night my knee felt fine but as I was laying in bed it would ache if my leg was not straight (i.e. when I was on my side).\n\nI then take 2 weeks off and this past weekend I went on another day hike. Same thing. Left knee aches. As soon as I am done hiking it begins to feel fine again. But it aches if it is in certain positions (like at night when I have less control...).\n\nIt has been two days since that last hike and my left knee is feeling fine again but I assume it will ache again with my next hike.\n\nI am planning on investing in some trekking poles but in the mean time it would be nice to know what sort of injury this is.\n\nThank you for any kind of help.","like_count":"1","tags":["Knee Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"davedsel2","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Left Knee Pain","resp_content":"Hello.

We can't begin to express how much we appreciate all of your input, but we are happy that you have made the transition and seem to like the new boards!\n\nWe know that there are a few bugs in these new message boards, but it was paramount to us to release the new boards as soon as possible because of how defective the old ones were, which were preventing users from being able to engage with one another. We wanted our members to at least have somewhere to go to create posts, share their stories and advice, and to provide support to others. Now, with this goal being met, we are definitely looking to improve these message boards and make them the best they can be. We've already logged many of the issues that you've already mentioned, and we are constantly looking for user input like yours.\n\nNow to answer some of your other questions:\n\n5. How can I access this message board from my Android smart phone?\n\nThis one is pretty straight forward. Simply type in messageboards.webmd.com into your internet browser on your phone. This should take you directly to the message boards.\n\n2. I am unable to contact you via the link given in the FAQ. I takes me to my Yahoo e-mail, forces me to login even though I am always logged in, then does not give me an address to send to.\n\nWe are looking into the issue that you're having with the link in the FAQ section. Just for clarification, are you referring to the link that says \"Message Board Support?\" In the meantime, you can always e-mail CommunityManagement@webmd.net and we will get back to you as soon as possible!\n\nYour suggestions are not being ignored!

Whether it's because you sit all day long at your desk in an unhappy position, you've forced your muscles through exercise or simply because you've carried too many grocery bags, you just know how unpleasant back pain can be and how it can stop you from conducting your daily activities normally.\nSo, what should you do? Some simple exercises that you can do when you're in pain but that you have to execute frequently to relieve pain, recover faster in the future to prevent other such trauma and strengthen your back muscles.\n\nIf you resort to inappropriate https://www.hlbenefits.com/exercises-lower-back-pain-relief/ , they can have grave consequences on your back, which is a very sensitive area that should not be forced.\nHere are a few exercises for lower back pain relief that can be done at home:\n\nPartial Crunches\n\nWhenever you have acute low back pain, avoid the exercises that can make things worse. Partial crunches are just the answer to your condition because they help you strengthen your back and stomach muscles. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bend and feet flat on the floor. Put your hands behind your neck, tighten your stomach muscles and then raise your shoulders off the floor, while breathing out. Do not use your arms to pull your neck off the floor. Hold for a second and then slowly lower back down. Repeat 8-12 times. Make sure your feet, lower back and tailbone are constantly in contact with the mat.\n\nHamstring Stretches\n\nLie on your back on the floor and bend one knee. Take a towel and loop it under the ball of your foot. First, strengthen the knee and then slowly pull it back towards your chest with the help of the towel. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2 to 4 times for each leg.\n\nWall Sits\n\nStand at a distance of 10 to 12 inches from the wall. Try to lean back until your back is flat against the wall. Slightly bend your knees, while pressing your lower back into the wall. Hold for a count to ten and then slowly slide back up that wall. Repeat 8-12 times.\n\nPress-up Back Extensions\n\nLie on your stomach on the floor and place your hands directly under your shoulders. The extension starts by pushing with your hands so your shoulders can lift off the floor. If that's too easy for you, just place your elbows on the floor directly under your shoulders and hold for a couple of seconds.\n\nBird Dog\n\nStart on your hands and knees and concentrate on tightening your stomach muscles. Lift and extend one leg behind you and then hold for 5 seconds. Switch to the other leg. Repeat 8-12 times for each leg. Make this exercise a little bit harder by lifting and extending the opposite arm for every repetition.\n\nKnee to Chest\n\nStart with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Bring your right knee to your chest, while keeping the left one flat on the floor. During the exercise, make sure your lower back is pressed to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat with the other leg. Do this four times for each leg.\n\nPelvic Tilts\n\nLie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Feel the contraction in your stomach as you were preparing for a punch. Press your back into the floor and feel your hips and pelvis rocking back. Breath in and out and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat the exercise 8-12 times.\n\nBridging\n\nLie on your back with your knees bent and heels touching the floor. Push the heels into the floor, squeeze your buttocks and lift your hips until you form a straight line between your shoulders, hips and knees. Hold for 5 seconds and slowly lower. Rest for 10 seconds and then repeat 8-12 times.\n\nLifting Weights\n\nLifting weights does not hurt your back as long as they are done properly. As a matter of fact, it helps relieve the back pain. Before submitting your lower back to such effort, ask your doctor if you should or should not lift weights.\n\nAerobic Exercise\n\nDoing aerobic exercise implies so many advantages. It strengthens your lungs, heart and blood vessels and it also helps you lose weight. Also, walking, swimming and biking may help relieve back pain.\n\nPilates Moves\n\nPilates is a combination of stretching, strengthening and core abdominal exercise. Ask for the help of a professional when engaging in such physical activity. Make sure you tell him about your back pain because you may need to avoid some moves.","like_count":"2","tags":["Back Pain"]},"responses":[{"author":"WebMD Morgan","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Exercises for Lower Back Pain","resp_content":"Interesting.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/328/exercises-for-lower-back-pain"},{"post":{"author":"haziago","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Lower back pressure when standing or lying down for the past week.","post_content":"I have been having lower back pressure for the past week, but only when standing or lying down.

I can share my own experience with you. I do have spinal stenosis in three areas and had both hips replaced last year - my right in June 2015 and my left in November 2015. I have been managing moderate to severe chronic pain from serious spinal problems and osteoarthritis throughout my whole body for over 40 years. I am not sure how the two are related, but arthritis is a progressive disease that causes further damage as you get older in most cases. Again, you should discuss this with your primary, pain management specialist or rheumatologist.\n\nI hope you find answers and relief soon.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/223/question"},{"post":{"author":"blessedladyptl","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Opiates, Benzodiazepines and Similiar Drugs-","post_content":"FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA warns about serious risks and death when combining opioid pain or cough medicines with benzodiazepines; requires its strongest warning-\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm518473.htm?source=govdelivery&;utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery","like_count":"1","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/225/opiates-benzodiazepines-and-similiar-drugs-"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Morgan","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"How do you manage your pain?","post_content":"Chronic pain has the ability to control a person's entire life.
