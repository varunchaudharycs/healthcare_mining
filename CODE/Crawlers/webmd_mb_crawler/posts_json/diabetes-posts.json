An a1c gives you an average blood sugar over the last 3 months. So it is the equivalent of testing once per minute, over those 3 months. The math would be 60 (tests/hr) X 24 (hrs/day) X 90 (days) = 129,600.\n\nThis is the equivalent of how many tests would be done to make up an a1c. If you were testing 3 times per day, that would be 3 X 90 = 270. That's how many tests you would have done for the equivalent time of the a1c.\n\nIf your a1c doesn't match the average on your meter, it's because there are an awful lot of hours where you are not testing.

They are plagued with providing accessibility to healthcare for all at an affordable price while ensuring costs are lower. At some point in life, most Americans can agree that they know what it feels like to not have health insurance; to wait until the simple home remedies do nothing to the ailing body before being propelled to the emergency room, which at that point, the bill would be excessively high but healthcare services will not be refused. For many, the Affordable Care Act was a relief. However, just as there is good, there is also bad.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a federal health reform that has improved many aspects of the healthcare system. It allows states to set its own eligibility requirements. As a result, many Americans became insured and made a conscious effort to take care of themselves through preventative care and following through with care plan and appointments due to having more screenings covered. The ACA also helped to improve private insurance to be more inclusive of coverage for women services and address mental health and substances abuse disorders (Obama, 2016). Under the ACA, Medicare pay rates were adjusted for transparency while care organizations and healthcare providers were held to be more accountable for patient care delivery (Obama, 2016). One of the best accomplishments for the ACA, is not denying anyone coverage because of a preexisting condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the ACA needs to improve many of its glitches. Even though many consumers may fall into the eligibility category, that extra cost for premiums affects the operation of their household, something that they might not elect to pay. The ACA also implemented taxes on medical equipment and pharmaceutical sales which drove the drug prices higher. Many employers reacted negatively toward the ACA by putting a freeze on hiring, decreasing employees’ hours, and reducing staff. “Business with 50 or more full-time employees must offer insurance or make payments to cover healthcare expenses for employees. By reducing hours, businesses are able to get by the 30-hour-per-week definition of a full-time employee” (Roland, 2019).\n\nThe Obama Administration laid the foundation to address the healthcare crisis by implementing the ACA. It is the responsibility of the federal and state government to continue to find ways to build on that foundation and correct the issues that are present. Some employers have been taking an initiative and working hard to keep costs down and promote a healthier workforce. They may offer incentives to premium reduction or reward benefits if employees participate in lifestyle coaching or tobacco cessation programs. “Employers also are covering services through new venues, such as retail health clinics and telemedicine, sometimes providing financial incentives for employees to use these new options” (Alliance for Health Policy, 2017). Some states have initiated raising the minimum wage so that families can afford to live and pay for basic necessities including healthcare.\n\nReference\n\nAlliance for Health Policy. (2017).

Any help is appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":["Type 2 Diabetes"]},"responses":[{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"8 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Exercise for older diabetics","resp_content":"Hi, Gloria, good question.\n\nI'm 63 M and I reversed my T2 Diabetes, 12 years ago. Yes, you read that, correctly. I haven't tested higher than 5.5 since 2006.\n\nDiet is very important and fitness is, too. I walk, outdoors, 2 miles, shadow box for 25 minutes and walk in place while watching youtube golf videos after waking for 30 minutes. None of my routines are daily exercises are difficult or excessively rigorous. I like to build a light sweat after each of my indoor workouts, though. The key is simple. Do something you enjoy and perform, everyday.\n\nIf you wish to lower your A1C (without taking prescription meds) you be well advised to perform daily habits that \"reverse\" insulin resistance. Diabetes is about your body's cells \"resisting\" the effects of insulin in your blood stream, thereby, preventing the entrance of glucose into the cells. So, the goal is to regain insulin sensitivity.\n\nHere, are a few of the things I practice, everyday (ie. \"habit\")\n1. I make my own meals utilizing fresh whole, healthy foods (I don't trust restaurants to look out for my health)\n2. I drink 96 ozs (3/4 gallon) of water, daily\n3. I workout, 24/7/365\n4. I use no table sugar.\n5. I started eating 2 meals a day (TMAD); 18hrs intermittent fasting\n6. I use no supplements, vitamins, drugs or alcohol\n7. I'm semi-retired and a care-giver, too.\n8. I drink apple cider vinegar and consume fermented/pickled vegetables, daily (natural pro & prebiotics).\n8. I focus on getting quality sleep (I conquered my sleep apnea) & I never, ever use an alarm clock (because I wake the same time, everyday, anyway)!\n\n\nIf you have weight to lose, Gloria, then, this is your chance to understand what Type 2 Diabetes really is and how and why you have it. Type 2 Diabetes has several names...insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, autoimmunity...but, at the end of the day, the only name that matters is \"Inflammation\".\n\nYour body has built up systemic toxins, over the years, that it can no longer neutralize, excrete or repair. Why? Because, we're old(er) and our bodies have gradually deteriorated and lost efficiency. Also, much has to do with normal aging hormonal reductions, as well. In other words, everything works/moves slower for people our age.\n\nWhen you increase your body's hydration, when you exercise, when you stop polluting your body with alcohol, drugs, processed\nfood, when you focus on shedding unnecessary stress in your life and, most importantly, when you understand the critical role sleep plays in controlling disease...\n\nyou lower inflammation...\nyou regain insulin sensitivity...\nyou lower your A1C...\nyou eliminate all other metabolic diseases, too (cancer, hypertension,\narthritis, high cholesterol, depression, Alzheimer's,tc), IBS, etc, etc)...\n\nLastly, after you've successfully lowered your A1C for 12 consecutive years, as I have, you realize that \"aging\" is not normal, at all. Aging is an inflammatory disease just like T2D.\n\n\n\nRecently, I had developed shoulder pain and it was deep in the joint. I incurred no injury and, so, I self diagnosed the condition as common \"impingement\". I did a 7 day water fast and the pain disappeared by the 5th day. Gone! I lost 9 lbs, too. Despite all my \"healthy\" habits & diet, despite having zero health conditions, despite being slightly below normal weight, I still suffered from \"inflammation\". The weight loss and disappearance of my shoulder pain proved, it.\n\nMy point is this: the key word in your post, above, is \"RELATIVELY\". The phrase, \"healthy diet\" in America is entirely meaningless, imo. I urge people not to use it!

I stopped measuring my blood sugar, daily, over 5 years, ago. Hell, I haven't been to see my doctor for an annual C.U. in almost three years! I'm 63 yo and haven't had a colonoscopy, yet! (and, my kid sister died from colon cancer in 2012!)\n\n\n4 mos, ago, I decided I needed to lose about 20 lbs. I knew I had gotten a little sloppy with my diet and daily routines so I tightened my lifestyle to reduce insulin resistance. How do I know I was successful?\n\n1. I lost the 20 lbs.\n2. My blood pressure dropped 15 points (130 to 115)\n3. My fasting blood sugar went from 100 to 80, on average.\n4. My skin quality and muscle tone dramatically improved.\n\nThis is what I did, daily...\n1. 10 servings of fruits and vegetables, daily\n2. 2 meals, a day, 6 hr eating : 18 hr fasting\n3. Drank 1 gallon of water, every day\n4. Boosted my exercise schedule by an additional 30 minutes\n5. Eliminated the use of all table sugar\n6. Absolutely no alcohol!\n\n\nHere's why it worked: You see, all those conditions I mentioned, above? They're indicative of decreasing liver function. Unfortunately, after the heart and brain, the liver is THE MOST CRITICAL organ in the human body! This is why all these conditions are \"related\" and closely tied to one another (ie. they ALL positively respond to improved, diet, exercise, stress management, etc...)\n\nBy fasting, by eating no processed food, by eating lots of fruits and vegetables, by restricting table sugar and alcohol, by getting plenty of rest and daily exercise, I'm restoring insulin sensitivity by rehabilitating and flushing out my liver, completely. I lighten it's workload & keep it clean to allow time for the body to repair/restore \"normal\" liver efficiency.\n\nDid I worry about \"measuring\" my stupid blood sugar levels?\nAbsolutely not!\nDo I have to measure my bloody blood pressure or get on a weight scale every 4 hrs?\nAbsolutely not!\n\nI took pictures of my my face and body and taped them to my bathroom mirror, then, posted a new set every week. You can see the freaking fat melting away! That's was the extent of my use of \"modern medical technology\". I used my cell phone camera to take pics...\n\n\n\nThere's a cure for Type 2 Diabetes. There's a cure for cancer. There's a cure for Obesity, Heart Disease, COPD and Alzheimer's, too. Food allergies, tooth decay, gout, IBS, PCOS, sleep apnea? I haven't had a bloody cold, headache or sore throat in over 7 years, now, let alone those wretched ailments! So. let me ask you: If you manifest zero symptoms, would you still believe you needed a colonoscopy???\n\nUnfortunately, at least in America, the doctors have got all these fools measuring \"blood sugar\" for Type 2 Diabetes.

Also, since cooking your own meals is absolutely essential to insure a proper, fresh, non processed diet, eating just two cooked meals a day is not only effective in restoring insulin sensitivity, it's cheaper and far more time efficient a lifestyle.\n\nNext time when someone recommends to you to eat many small meals a day, just walk away. They don't have the slightest clue what they're talking about.\n\n\nFinally, water consumption. Once you age beyond 40, your body slowly starts to lose thirst impulse. You just don't get that thirsty, anymore.\n\nThis is the reason why so many seniors suffer multiple health conditions. They simply don't drink enough water. Water is essentially for basic liver maintenance. and, since the liver plays a massive role in blood sugar control, this is why so many seniors have Type 2 Diabetes (&, high cholesterol, high blood pressure). It's common sense, actually.\n\nUnfortunately, so many people can't think for themselves; they have to have a doctor tell them what they have to do. Note: The very first thing any reasonably good doctor tells their patients: \"Are you drinking enough water?\"\n\nWhy do you suppose they say that?\nThey say it because they don't want you to take diabetes drugs.

Yes, that is a \"classic\" symptom of high blood sugar in the bloodstream and when the body has developed a condition known as \"insulin resistance\", it will take alternative measures to rid itself of dangerously, high levels of blood glucose...hence, by peeing!\n\nNote: It's (frequent urination) brilliant, actually, and demonstrates how genius the body is in \"problem solving\" when confronted by someone who is forcing an unhealthy lifestyle (ie. diet) down \"its\" throat. The body finds a way, somehow, to \"protect\" that person. Both, by weight gain and peeing and, in some cases, weight loss, too! Our body's survival, protection and self-healing mechanisms have evolved over millions of years and it's ability to resolve \"threats\" against it's \"systems\" are beyond, even to this day, our understanding.\n\nType 2 Diabetes is closely tied to a condition known as \"metabolic syndrome\" (aka prediabetes). There are five risk factors of this condition:\n\nhigh blood sugar\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh triglycerides\nlow HDL cholesterol\n&, lastly, obesity\n\n\n\nWhat does this have to do with your question?\n\nIt means, people don't just develop Type 2 Diabetes out of the clear blue. If you have Type Diabetes, you're likely to also have two, three, possibly, 4 of the other \"bedfellows\" of metabolic syndrome...\n\nSo, are you overweight? Have you checked your blood pressure, lately? Has your doctor been reminding you to try to do \"something\", every visit, for the last 10+ years? Are you taking prescription meds?\n\nIn other words, any reasonably decent doctor can spot Type 2 Diabetes advancing (like on on-coming freight train), years BEFORE it finally lands.\n\nPS: Infections, allergies, fatigue, gut problems and slow wound healing are also classic symptoms of diabetes because chronic high blood sugar levels prevent your body's immune system in doing a proper job. &, once, your immune system is compromised, its \"Katie bar the door\". You waited too late to take action, now, get ready for the sht storm...\n\nIf you follow your doctor's advice (about making changes to your life), you'll have nothing to worry.

My Glucose level shot up to 307 and I almost passed out it has gone up before but never close to 200. I called the emergency room back this morning and told them what had happened last and told them that this morning it was still up over 200 was informed that they would only give me the maintenance drugs, but would not give me anything for immediate results. I medicine on file at my pharmacy and at home if I need to take maintenance drugs. I did take them after this episode. But these drugs work gradually and I need something that is going to work fast. I have been drinking water with apple cider vinegar in it but my glucose level the last time that I checked was 220.

She takes no meds. She has no joint pain, walks in balance & stability, vitals are, all, normal. Though she no longer maintains a regular, daily exercise program, she has maintained a weight of 105 lbs, +/- 3 to 4 lbs, for the last 20 years.\n\nShe, too, eats a \"healthy\" diet.\n\nMy point is: A true \"healthy\" diet builds a foundation for stability. The human body seeks to maintain homeostasis. It does not want to gain weight. It does not wish for rising blood pressure or blood sugar or dislipidemia. Its does not want to develop malignant tumors or auto-immune conditions like hashimoto's thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis or pernicious anemia...\n\nIf vitals are changing, this means the body is NOT in a balanced state...it's, actually, in turmoil! It suggests that \"inflammation\" is taking place in multiple areas of the body. This is not \"healthy\". This is, in fact, \"unhealthy\". That's about as common sense simple as I can put it.\n\n\nMy recommendation to any person suffering from any lifestyle disease, before you start dosing (or, shall I say, \"dousing\") your body with prescription drugs (that really have no natural business being in your body from the get-go), you need to establish a baseline, daily lifestyle process that yields some semblance of stability and consistency. Exercise, diet, water consumption, sleep, relaxation are, all, necessary factors for stable health and fitness.\n\nAnd, the very first place you start is with diet! A healthy diet does not make things worse! You do not gain weight & become obese by eating a healthy diet. Nobody in the history of history has gotten big eating apples, spinach, sweet potato or green onions on a routine basis.\n\nIn truth, a healthy diet can not only provide homeostasis & balance, but, in my case, it help me to \"reverse\" my obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. I've not A1c tested higher than 5.5 in the last 12 years by eating a \"healthy\" diet.\n\n\nThis is a perfect example of how the medical community \"treats\" diseases like T2 diabetes: Take the patient's word about leading a \"healthy\" lifestyle, then, throw drugs (and, $$$) at the problem. This is the extent of our exploration and investigation into root cause analysis of T2D.\n\nIntelligent and highly educated adults, here, never ask the questions,\n\n1.

Why do blood sugar, triglycerides, blood pressure, HDL, all, seem to magically \"normalize\" with weight loss?\n\nMy body \"treated\" my T2 diabetes (just as it had the first 50 years of my life!).

But the truth is that explaining what you’re going through as you live your daily life with diabetes can be difficult, if not impossible at times. Still, that shouldn’t get you down. A recent survey shows that 1 in 8 Americans has type 2 diabetes. With that statistic in mind, here’s what a handful of others just like you think about what they’re going through, and what they long for others to know about it too.\n\n\"Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to make all the right choices and maintain our health, the disease just wins anyway and gets the best of us, even on our best days. But not every day is bad, which makes the good days really sweet (no pun intended) and worth the fight.\"\n-ADNEV JO, LIVING WITH DIABETES\n\n\"Even though we don’t look sick, we are.\"\n-JOSE GUZMAN, LIVING WITH DIABETES\n\n\"My life has become a terrifying place to be. I fall without warning, and can’t get up without assistance. I didn’t take care of myself when I had the chance, and now I may never have the full use of my feet. I danced for 16 years, from the age of 3 until I was 19 — Indian classical (Bharatanatyam), Bollywood, jazz, hip-hop, and it was amazing. I may never do that again.\"\n-SONA SANGHVI, LIVING WITH DIABETES\n\n\"I am sure that one day I will look back at all that I have accomplished and think that it wasn’t too hard. Hell, I look back now at where I am and where I was and think that it wasn’t difficult. But the truth is that each step of the way feels difficult as we move forward into the unknown of our mission: the unknown knowledge, the unknown endurance, and the unknown strength that we possess inside ourselves waiting to come out. I have beat the smoking habit, I will beat diabetes, and I will arrive one day completely debt free. For this is my mission.\"\n-BILLY, LIVING WITH DIABETES AND BLOGGER OF SIMPLE LIVING OVER 50\n\n\"It’s not only about following orders, or fulfilling requirements. The emotional component of diabetes makes it way more complicated than that.\"\n-BEA SPARKS, LIVING WITH DIABETES AND BLOGGER AT THE TYPE 2 EXPERIENCE\n\nSo, to answer your question (\"What happens to a person who has type two diabetes if they stop taking their meds?\"), It depends on who you are, does it not?\nAre you ADNEV JO, JOSE GUZMAN, SONA SANGHVI, BILLY or, BEA SPARKS?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe key quote that applies to you is \"Billy's\":\n\"...But the truth is that each step of the way feels difficult as we move forward into the unknown of our mission...\"\n\nI can tell you what happened to me when I told my doctor, \"No. I don't plan on taking metformin for my Type 2 Diabetes.\" She gave me a choice. You need to do one of two things: A. You need to start taking diabetes drugs that I recommend, or, B. You need to lose weight (44 lbs) through diet, exercise and taking better care of yourself.\n\nI chose, B. That was over 12 years ago. I have never had a A1C test, since that time, higher than 5.6 (its currently 5.1).\n\nType 2 Diabetes is not a mystery to me, anymore. Its not an unknown. Its not something to fear. That's because I studied the disease and removed the mystery. I learned about insulin resistance, how the aging process accelerates it, how diet and exercise can slow and even \"reverse\" Type 2 Diabetes. And, how my Type 2 Diabetes was fueled by stress and sleep apnea like gasoline to flame.\n\nAll the quotes, above, are by people who live in doubt. They don't know what's going to happen, next. Since, they don't understand how Type 2 Diabetes works, they have no way of determining whether they are getting better or getting worse. All they know is their \"sick\".\n\nThe only person who has a \"chance\" is \"Billy\". He's committed to asking questions and finding answers. He's determined to become \"educated\" about Type 2 Diabetes. And, the more you study and learn, the picture becomes clearer and clearer: \"You don't TREAT diabetes (especially with drugs)! You re-tool your body, get it back in tip-top shape, and blood glucose levels normalize, automatically.\"\n\nSo, to answer your question, it depends entirely on who you are. If you stop taking metformin on a wing and a prayer, I'd say you're a damn fool. But, if you're determined (like Billy and me) to remove the \"mystery & fear\" from the T2 Diabetes equation and \"work the problem\" just like any other problem, I'd say, \"Good for you! You're on the right track to never having to worry about this disease, again\".\n\nThere's only one person qualified in this world to answer your question.

It is based on my own experiences with diabetes as well as personal observations on the struggles of many, many others who have “struggled” with managing the condition.\n\nFirst and foremost, you would probably get more replies to your post if you would simply create a user ID that we can address you by instead of using “Anonymous.” A user ID will add a personal touch to your posts without necessarily exposing your true identity (unless you choose to use your real name), nor your address, or any other personal information.\n\nI used to be a frequent poster on WebMD’s diabetes forum (now renamed a “Message Board”) but had pretty much abandoned it (as well as other online forums) in favor of helping folks on a more personal, local basis. But not always successfully, I might add. In the past two years, three of our local diabetes support group members have died (two of diabetic-related complications) and one had to have the toes on both feet amputated despite my (and other’s) best efforts to get him to “normalize” his blood sugars.\nThis could be the problem in your own situation. Your daughter’s many symptoms do suggest that she has out-of-control blood sugars. If she has been hospitalized seven times in eight weeks, clearly something is out of balance. In diabetics, gastroparesis is most often caused by neuropathy (nerve damage) of the vagus nerve. Neuropathy is a frequent and all too common complication associated with elevated blood sugars. That means people who have blood sugars that are “above normal.”\n\nYou also state that after the hospital stabilizes her, she is sent home and “within a matter of days,” the cycle repeats. That begs the question: why hasn’t anyone bothered to teach her how to “stabilize” herself? Why hasn’t she learned it on her own? That’s not meant to be critical; only to emphasize that managing diabetes successfully has always been 95% patient and only 5% doctor. The process is much, much easier than you or your daughter might think and perhaps we can go into aspects of this in a future post.\n\nYou seem puzzled that your daughter is suffering from all of her symptoms but her “A1c is always good.” You also state that you have been “monitoring her diet, sugar levels, and insulin, and all are in compliance.” Unfortunately, “in compliance” begs the questions, in compliance with what? The terms “normal” and “in compliance” is similar to the Food Industry’s use of “all natural,” “healthy,” and similar misleading terminology. The ADA guidelines for diet, blood sugar levels, and A1c levels are toxic for many of us. By using our BG meters and “eating-to-our-meters,” we have learned how to find out what works for us individually since we are all unique.\n\nI should note that a “good” A1c is possible even with uncontrolled diabetes. That’s because the A1c is only an average of blood sugar bonding to RBCs that includes ALL glycated hemoglobin during periods of both high and low blood sugars. If your daughter is undergoing roller-coaster blood sugars that bottom out in the twenties or even lower (e.g., the DKA she experienced), then spiking up into the high 300’s, 400’s, or even higher, after a meal, the overall average might appear to be “good” or “near-normal” but she may suffer severe damage during her highs (and risking her very life when it drops too low). Here are just a few of the many questions that spring to mind:\n1. Has your daughter adopted a low-carb diet (either LCHF or LCHP)?\n2. Does she test her blood sugar level before meals and two hours after? If so, what are her average results? (note: I did not ask whether they were “compliant”).\n3. Does she test her blood sugar at bedtime? If it is high, does she take a corrective dose of insulin before going to bed?\n4. Does her meal plans include the concept, “Eat-to-your-meter”?\n5. Does your daughter have a “target zone” for blood sugar levels before and after meals, at bedtime, and on arising (and how often does she meet her target)? Are those targets greater than two digits?\n6. Is your daughter on the obsolete “sliding scale” dosage chart for the insulin that she injects or is she on a FIT (Flexible Insulin Therapy) plan?\n7. Does your daughter use a CGM and/or insulin pump?\n\nYour daughter’s situation seems like it would be greatly helped by improved education. As diabetics, we are all different. There is no “one size fits all.” It is essential for all PWDs to learn how things (food, exercise, and insulin) affect each of us individually. Then take appropriate action to keep everything in balance. It is not as difficult as it might sound.\n\nI have been insulin-dependent myself for over fifteen years. Prior to starting insulin, I had pretty severe neuropathy and foot drop syndrome. After normalizing my blood sugars (and that’s “true normal”; not the organ-damaging levels recommended by the ADA and many health professionals). My neuropathy began to fade within three months and reversed after about six. It took nearly two years, however, for a more complete recovery. My average A1c over the past fifteen years has varied between 4.8 on the low end and 5.4 on the high end. My target for both bedtime and fasting blood sugar levels is under 90 mg/dL and I am successful in reaching it the majority of the time.\n\nOne of the fastest-growing and largest diabetes support groups on Facebook for T1s is Type1Grit. Members there credit their remarkable “normal” results on the “Dr. B protocols”. “Dr. B” is Dr. Richard K. Bernstein who laid out his guidelines or normalizing blood sugars in in his book, “Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars.” You can read portions of the 2007 edition of his book online for free at diabetes-book.com (at the home page, just click on the menu tab, [Read Online]). Be sure to read his life story as well as the chapters on Food, Gastroparesis, and Chapter 7: The Law of Small Numbers.\n\nAnonymous, if you read this post and would like to continue a dialogue, please post back. I have not frequented these message boards for quite a while but will check back periodically over the next two weeks to see if you have replied (don’t expect too prompt a response, however). I am confident that if your daughter familiarizes herself about the “Dr. B Protocols” and learns how to successfully apply them to her own situation, she can join the growing number of diabetics worldwide who have tamed their diabetes to live virtually normal lives. Better still, go to the Type1Grit board on Facebook and be pleasantly surprised to see how many T1s are managing their diabetes successfully.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you so much for taking the time to prepare such an in-depth response. Checking out Type1Grit right now!","resp_content":"Reply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\nGlad you finally got a \"thank you\" for this extraordinary post, nutri, and welcome back!\n"},{"author":"nutrijoy","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: At our wits end...","resp_content":"Anon,\nYour post drew me out of my self-imposed forum posting retirement because I could “feel” the pain, frustration and anguish you projected. The path that your daughter was on seemed to even threaten her ability to celebrate her 23rd birthday. By that, I don’t mean to just live through that date but to actually celebrate and enjoy it; something that’s possible only with good health. Here are some initial suggestions:\n\n1. One of the first things that both you and she needs to do is to discard any guilt or self-blame in her situation and, instead, embrace a “CAN DO THIS” spirit. It isn’t magic, it isn’t even very difficult (challenging, yes, but not difficult). You only need to clear your mind, recognize that what she has been doing is clearly not working for her, and be willing to embark on a new path, a new direction.\n\n2. If you/she aren’t already doing so, start keeping a journal, log or diary of her dietary consumption, insulin dosages together with a detailed, running record of her blood sugar levels. Don’t just write everything down. Go back and review and analyze the data on a daily basis. Try to see if you can spot any trends, correlations, and/or associations because therein lies your solutions. The use of a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) would be of tremendous help but due to their expense, is not an absolute necessity. Many, many thousands of us have never used a CGM (including me); yet we are able to achieve near-normal (non-diabetic) blood sugars.\n\n3. Learn all that you can, but at a pace that does not overwhelm your capacity to absorb and comprehend the information. Be absolutely certain that your education comes from reliable, proven sources based on positive results from the readers and not just testimonials that are merely promotional propaganda. Avoid books with glib promises such as those that claim their particular “secrets” will “reverse” your diabetes. For example, far too many of the authors who advocate that merely adopting a plant-based diet will result in a miraculous improvement are guilty of this false promise. Here are my personal recommendations:\nDr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution - Richard K. Bernstein\nThink Like A Pancreas - Gary Scheiner\nBlood Sugar 101, 2nd Edition - Jenny Ruhl\n\n4. There are three groups of macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and protein. Of the three, carbohydrates have the single greatest impact on blood sugars. Even the ADA and virtually all doctors and dietitians acknowledge this fact. Yet most continue to tell patients that they “need” to consume carbs to function; that it is essential to eat at least 40 Gms per meal or more! That is an absolutely false statement and holds no truth whatsoever. You may already know this or have seen this in many of the postings on Type1Grit. Even young kids know that carbs and processed foods are damaging to T1s. Has any member of your daughter’s healthcare team recommended a low-carb or paleo-based diet to your daughter?\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, be sure to watch this presentation by R. David Dikeman on the DietDoctor website:\nhttps://www.dietdoctor.com/member/presentations/dikeman\n\nProtein will also convert into glucose through a process known as gluconeogenesis but it is a slow process and most T2’s can secrete sufficient insulin to keep pace. However, most T1’s need to use insulin to offset the protein conversion and very often, a slower form of bolus insulin may work better (e.g., Regular-R). I personally only use the faster acting insulins (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra) to correct highs but my mainstay insulin is R (Humalin-R or Novolin-R). One significant word of caution: When reducing carb consumption or changing insulin types, it is essential to talk with her doctor. If he/she is not receptive but cannot provide an acceptable explanation, then you may need to seek guidance elsewhere. However, don’t go on your own.\n\nComment: I personally DID start using insulin on my own but my mother was diabetic and taught me more about diabetes, dietary impacts, and insulin dosing than anything I ever learned in pharmacy school (I earned a doctorate in Pharmacy at USC). Although I started dosing with insulin on my own, I did do due diligence research before doing so. However, this is NOT something that would be safe nor recommended for most people.\n\n5. Consider the wise advice of people at the Behavioral Diabetes Institute: maintain the best blood sugar control you can, avoid lows (hypoglycemia) especially severe lows, and live your life. Don’t place any credibility on the constant claims that a cure for Type 1 diabetes is “just around the corner.” Don’t use your meter to shoot for perfection. Simply establish goals (target range for acceptable blood sugar levels) and then try to attain them. This should not be a static number but dynamic, subject to ongoing change and improvement. Don’t beat yourself up if you fall short; just evaluate the data and try to do better next time.\n\n6) TEST, TEST, TEST! Frequent blood glucose testing normally results in better control. Don’t allow embarrassment to prevent you from testing or injecting in public if you are not using an insulin pump. Insulin dosing is essential to maintaining and preserving your health so just do it. You should try to be discreet when possible, of course, but at other times, you can use the privacy of your car or a nook or cranny in a building. I have even used a restroom occasionally but usually choose not to due to the unclean environment of most public restrooms.\n\n7. Eat to your meter - use your blood glucose meter to test your blood sugar after meals. Journal everything and gradually eliminate from your diet those foods that spike your blood sugar. Follow “the rule of small numbers,” Dr. Richard K. Bernstein’s principle of “big inputs make big mistakes; small inputs make small mistakes.” Simply put, lower carb intake means lower doses of insulin are required and smaller doses mean smaller “mistakes” (dosage errors) will be made. Do NOT try to consume large amounts of carbohydrates and then try to offset their effect by injecting large doses of insulin, regardless of what the A.D.A., diabetes “educator,” or dietitian often keeps telling PWDs. Food and insulin both have activity curves that are different from one another. Trying to match the two action curves to prevent spikes and blood sugar hypos is virtually impossible. Roller coaster blood sugars do long term damage to the internal organs of any diabetic resulting in many complications. Avoid this disaster at all costs.\n\n8. Re-evaluate the capabilities of your daughter’s existing healthcare team. Based on your own post, there may be some serious shortcomings in the care and advice they are providing to her. It may very well not be a case of your daughter just being “non-compliant” or “mismanaging” her diabetes but could suggest a change in one or more members of her health care team. Make your evaluation and analysis as objective as possible. Seek a second or outside opinion if necessary. However, the bottom line is that each of us is responsible for 90% to 95% of our diabetes management and we can’t afford to pass the buck. One of the most challenging factors in controlling blood sugars is your daughter's gastroparesis. How advanced or serious is her gastro?\n\nThese suggestions are just a bare beginning but will provide you and your daughter with ample food for critical and objective thought. I’m sure that some of them are redundant and that you are already following them. However, your daughter’s declining results indicate that she may be frustrated, perhaps even depressed, and may no longer be evaluating her procedures objectively. In my youth, the hippies had a favorite saying:\n“Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” Then Dr. Albert Einstein was attributed with coming out with a series of quotes, two of which have been my personal favorites:\n“You never fail until you stop trying” and “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”\n\nSide note to Brunosbud: glad to see a name that I recognize.

Curious about numbers","post_content":"Today I was thinking about my health and was curious to see how my blood sugar levels are. So when I was at the store I brought a device with the test strips. I probably did over 20 different samples. I ate a lot of crackers and pretzels around 130-2pm. I started testing around 5 and finished around 530 just to get a string of numbers and to get the hang of it. I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes or have symptoms but here are my values.\n\n137\n130\n203\n215\n100\n110\n90\n112\n129\n142\n118\n145\n118\n129\n145\n118\n46\n142\n\nThose are some of the values I started recording. I know the numbers vary a lot. I’ve been trying to get the right amount on the test strip. Sometimes I would flood it, some times I would almost fill the entire little box up, fill it, and not fill the strip all the way. Later on 3 hours after I ate my dinner I tested my sugar again. I got a reading of 97,112,120, and before I went to bed it got a reading of 116.\n\nThe next morning I woke up and got a reading after not eating for 12 hours a score of 107. Which is above the recommended fasting range of 80-100. So I tested a few more times ten minutes later and scored 112,108,86,99,94, and 92. A few hours later I ate a frozen dinner for breakfast and had my coffee and two hours after eating I tested again and got another series of numbers. I got many numbers in the low 100s, some in the 110-120 range and two in the 130s. I guess that’s in normal range.\n\nI also was looking at my blood test results from my doctor from the past years. Here’s what they had.\n\nFebruary 2016 fasting glucose 94 (they put it in as fasting but I know I wasn’t at the time)\n\nOctober 2016 random glucose 79\nJanuary 2018 random glucose 86.\n\nThey were all in normal range but the thing I’m worried about were the higher values I got at home when I first did it and the 107 when I first got up. Should I worry about being diabetic or am I putting too much thought into it. I’m so worried about my health and I can’t help it because I have OCD so I keep on obsessing.

Because these two vitals are the LAST TO CHANGE (before you really begin that downward slide to adult pampers). Why is this important to know?\n\n1. Because, by being aware of the importance of these two vitals and how to measure them, we could slash the entire medical bill of the US be 75% because everyone would know when it's time to go see a doctor!!!

That said, I have been diabetic for decades, and both Type 1 and Type 2 are generously interspersed throughout generations of my family.\n\nPain is pain regardless of source. Patients owe it to both themselves and their families to do everything possible to be able to function at their respective highest level - whatever that is. Diabetes and diabetic neuropathy can cause intense and often debilitating pain. Unless you have experienced it personally or even cared daily for someone who has, it is - at best - difficult to appreciate. Applying labels - or implying that taking insulin will always escalate into needing more insulin in and of itself - is not the experience of me or anyone in my family.

Once the pain is tolerable, other improvements can begin. If pain meds can be later decreased or eliminated completely, so much the better.

It is typical of many scams online that target people with chronic diseases. Common tip-offs that are associated with scam products (including this one) include:\n\n1. The \"free trial offer\" is just that: a free TRIAL. If you opt to keep it, you will be billed the regular price; often that is IN ADDITION to the original postage&handling that you paid up front.\n\n2. When you use a search engine to look for user \"reviews,\" you'll find many dozens (if not hundreds) of fake reviews singing the praises of the supplement; most of them are either \"seeded\" (i.e., planted by the supplement/book vendor) or are on sites that will promote the item because they will profit from the sale (i.e., will receive a commission).\n\n3. Trying to find the Nutritional Facts will often only display a barely readable thumbnail-like picture of the label but not a full-sized one that would enable you to research the ingredients objectively online. For Diabazole, here's the full ingredient list:\n\nVitamin C (as ascorbic acid)\n\nVitamin E (as tocopherol)\n\nBiotin\n\nMagnesium (as magnesium oxide)\n\nZinc\n\nManganese\n\nChromium (as amino acid chelate)\n\nGuggul (10% guggulsterones)\n\nBitter Melon (4:1 extract)\n\nLicorice Extract\n\nCinnamon herb powder\n\nGymnema Sylvestre herb powder\n\nAlpha Lipoic Acid\n\nJuniper Berry herb powder\n\nBanaba (1% extract)\n\nYarrow\n\nHuckleberry herb powder\n\nL-Taurine\n\nCayenne powder herb powder\n\nVanadyl Sulfate\n\n4. Some of the ingredients have shown to have some slight merit in lowering blood sugars in \"some\" patients (small percentage). Many have roots in Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine that dates back hundreds of years. However, that was before the introduction of processed foods and its toxic chemicals (added sugars, preservatives, coloring agents, and other harmful ingredients). Other ingredients are potentially harmful when used on a long term basis (high on the suspect list is Vanadyl Sulfate). And you if need some food for thought, if the Ayurvedic ingredients are so beneficial, why does India currently have a diabetes epidemic on its hands (65 million diabetics and growing!)? Surely Indians would be taking/using their own supplements if they actually brought down blood sugar levels to meaningful, safe levels.\n\n5. But how can you tell if its a scam? Read the fine print. The \"free bottle\" is limited to a very short window; if you keep the bottle beyond the trial window, your credit card will be billed the full price of the supplement. And what's the REAL trial period? In this particular case, it is fourteen days and that is not 14 days in which you can actually try the product. It is 14 days from the DATE of your original order. If it takes up to 5 days for the product to arrive at your doorstep and you don't actually start taking it until the following day, it means you only have 8 days for your actual trial. That's often not sufficient time for an evaluation.\n\n6. Look for objective user reviews online. If a link to actually buy the supplement is embedded anywhere in the \"review,\" it's not genuine. User reviews never include links to a vendor's site; only to studies or other references. I often try to find it on Amazon first. Legitimate products are often sold by this vendor. If there are user reviews posted, I always start with the one-star reviews because they may be more pertinent than glowing praises from clueless users or shills.\n\n7. Research each of the ingredients online in the Nutrition FAQs for a product. I have personally tried most of them and a few ingredients DID help in lowering my after meal blood sugar levels. However, if you think that lowering your blood sugar levels a whopping 0.2% is cost-effective, I might recommend that you try taking a brisk walk around the block instead after meals. The walk will probably lower your blood sugars by 0.5% or more or better than twice as much ... without risking taking substances that could have long term adverse consequences including to your wallet!\n\n8. I could go on and on but it is incumbent on you to do your own homework. However, a very reliable tip-off that a product is being over-hyped, over-priced, and may provide a very poor cost-benefit ratio is to simply close the vendor's web page. If you are greeted with a \"Wait, don't go!' type of message, and tempted with a significant \"one-time only\" lowest-price\" offer with two options: [Stay on page] or [Leave page], don't waste any time hastening your departure.\n\n3\n"},{"author":"rhondawilliams443","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"Thank you for this in-depth review of what diabazole can and especially what can't do for us.

Any of it. And, it took his loving sons to beg him to change his life, that he had no right to deprive his grand kids from being a vital part of their lives, it took the imminent threat of having his foot amputated, before he took his first steps towards reversing his diabetes.\n\nI only post this comment for those, out there, that feel the same way that \"Dad\" feels about his sons and his grand sons. That's the way I feel about mine, too. Because, we live in a world, now, that \"blame\" is not tolerated. \"Blame\" has become a four-letter word.\n\nBut, when it comes to Type 2 Diabetes, it will \"progress\" if you try to \"treat\" it. I learned this valuable lesson from my father who followed his diabetes doctors every word...and, in the end, still got taken to the woodshed by T2D!\n\nThe system of T2D \"treatment\" in the US, predicated on taking drugs, is, for lack of a better word, \"delusional\". \"Dad\" shows this so wonderfully. Because,\nIt's hard to change...\nWe shouldn't \"blame\" or \"judge\" one another and...\nIf reversing T2D is within the grasp of millions of diabetics in this country, why the hell isn't this the Number 1 topic discussed on this board?\n\nDad: \"...I only wished I had that 'light bulb' moment, early on..........it\nliterally took me seeing a guy having his foot cut off, before I\nrealized, \"Whoa.

If you don't change your lifestyle and try to \"treat\" your diabetes (with drugs), in the end, you could be faced with the\nharsh and brutal realities of end stage diabetes. You have to change, NOW, and time's a wastin'. Start will small changes in diet, a few veggies and maybe some full fat, plain greek yogurt and add a little exercise to your daily routine.\n\nFinally, understand this. Nobody will force you to do this. Nobody will make any demands that you save yourself (like Dad's sons). Nobody will tell you the sky will fall if you don't stop eating the things you love. Being perfectly honest, I could care less if you decide to reverse your Type 2 Diabetes like \"Dad\" (and I) did. It's a free country; Do whatever you like as long as it doesn't affect my life in the least. And, you eating fruit & vegetables, daily, will still cost me a $1 at the local McDonalds...\n\nBut, if you want to really want to beat T2D, you have to take responsibility. The buck stops, here. You have to \"BLAME\" yourself!

This condition is called latent autoimmune diabetes\nin adults (LADA).\n\nResearchers estimate that between 4 and 14 percent of people\ndiagnosed with type 2 diabetes might actually have LADA. Many\nphysicians are still unfamiliar with the condition and will assume a\nperson has type 2 diabetes because of their age and symptoms.\n\nIn general, a misdiagnosis is possible because:\n\nboth LADA and type 2 diabetes typically develop in adults\nthe initial symptoms of LADA — such as excessive thirst, blurred\nvision, and high blood sugar — mimic those of type 2 diabetes\ndoctors don’t typically run tests for LADA when diagnosing diabetes\ninitially, the pancreas in people with LADA still produces some\ninsulin diet, exercise, and oral drugs usually used to treat type 2\ndiabetes work well in people with LADA at first\nAs of now, there is still a lot of uncertainty over how exactly to define\nLADA and what causes it to develop. The exact cause of LADA isn’t\nyet known, but researchers have identified certain genes that may\nplay a role.\n\nLADA may only be suspected after your doctor realizes that you’re\nnot responding (or no longer responding) well to oral type 2 diabetes\ntreatments, diet, and exercise...\"\n\n(pardon me, mrsc, but if this is NOT the \"spectrum\" you're referring to, please, provide some references that we can examine to understand your point. thx)\n\n\nI've made this point on more than one occasion but the fact that Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes share the word \"Diabetes\" in its name is one of the biggest travesties in medical terminology, imho.\n\n9 out 10 diabetics in this country are Type 2.

Reason being, I was able to improve my insulin sensitivity (through diet and fitness) so my body was eventually able to \"restore\" normal blood glucose regulation.\n\nType 1 Diabetics can't \"reverse\" their condition. Their blood sugar irregularity is not caused by insulin resistance (from too much insulin). Their problem is their pancreas makes insufficient or no insulin, at all.\n\nBottomline, reversing Type 2 Diabetes refers to training your body to use less insulin. Type 1 Diabetes is caused by too little insulin. The conditions may share the same \"name\" but, from my perspective, they are as different as night and day.\n\nNote: Many Type 2's eventually wind up injecting insulin, same as Type 1s.

A special test called an HBA1C is performed, among other tests. The HBA1C is a percentage of how much glucose is attached to your red blood cells, I believe. It is measured as a percentage. A person who does not have diabetes will get an HBA1C result of 4 - 6%. Higher than a 6% result shows that the person does have diabetes.\n\nEvery person who has been diagnosed with diabetes needs to test their blood glucose readings often using a home a glucose testing kit. The first test of the day is called a fasting test, and should be done after 10-12 hours with no food at all and some plain water. Then a test called \"post-prandial\" is done 2 hours after eating a meal. The goal is to get a fasting glucose reading at home of 70-100, and a post-prandial reading of less that 140 (some doctors and experts say up to 180 is OK).\n\nSo, the doctor should order a fasting blood test called an HBA1C to be performed at a lab about every 3 months.

The lemmings that take their pills, fret about \"blood glucose\" and complain about their doctors\nhave wound up in the same boat for the last 60 years...sailing out to sea without a paddle.\n\nThe purpose and goal of intermittent fasting is the same as ketogenic diet: Its to deplete excess glycogen stores and, ultimately, rein-in an over-active liver that keeps dumping sugar into the bloodstream, even when there's no muscle activity (like when you're sleeping). Once the glycogen stores are minimized, the body can feed off body fat to generate energy. Thus, when performed properly, you've basically hardwired your body to metabolize food in a whole nother fashion.\n\nThat's the theory. You can do the same thing through starvation. Nobody has died during \"Naked and Afraid\" and nobody has Type 2 Diabetes once they return to civilization, either, because burning fat for energy is the holy grail of diabetes (and cancer, and arthritis, and heart disease, and high blood pressure, yada, yada...)\n\nI had T2D a dozen years ago.

Avoid eating heavily processed food, don't eat out and watch the (added) sugar. I get an In-n-Out Dbl-Dbl w everything, once a month.

First off, as already mentioned, getting educated and setup with a specialist would be my focus (I have always seen an Endocrinologist and have had great success). These forums are great, but having a medical prof. looking at your boyfriend's glucose readings/A1C/blood work can help you two know how to tackle this thing. There's so much to learn at the beginning that it WILL feel overwhelming. That's ok. Your boyfriend is obviously lucky to have someone that is willing and wants to help him control his health and his future.\nJust a couple tips I'd give: always try to bolus (fast-acting insulin) before meals. This keeps me in check with what I am eating, because if I do X amount of units, I know I can only eat X carbs without another correction. Also, ALWAYS carry some kind of snack/juice/candy to get his blood sugar up if it plummets. I emphasize always because I have been hospitalized simply because I didn't have anything on me and didn't have access to it either. Lastly, know that diabetes will probably not be going anywhere anytime soon. In other words, and it already sounds like you are, but mentally & emotionally, be ready to be in this for the long haul. There will be great days and there will be terrible days. The only thing you & your boyfriend can do is to keep trying, learning & making adjustments.\nI apologize this turned into a novel.

A fasting blood glucose reading between 100 - 125 indicates Pre-Diabetes. At this point, you can prevent your readings from increasing without medication by following a healthy diet low in carbohydrates as well as getting as much exercise as possible.\n\nI am hoping that your doctor is trying to encourage you to change your lifestyle and does not believe this reading may not indicate Diabetes. If that is the case, you need to find a different doctor who is more aware of current research. An ideal fasting blood glucose reading is 80-100.\n\nGenetics play a huge role in developing Diabetes.

First, the pump is a great tool to adjust insulin before, during and after your workouts. But, because there are sooo many options it can get a bit overwhelming too. First, you may need to do a temporary basal rate a few hours prior to your workout. You may need to do a temp. basal rate during (or disconnect) and post workout too. And, if you are eating meals before or after your activity you may also need to adjust your bolus dose too! Ultimately, you are correct. If you are drinking or snacking a lot to offset a low blood sugar, it can negate the calories burned during your workout. It can be very frustrating!\n\nAs a VERY general guideline, you do not want your blood sugar lower than 110mg/dl after your workout (and if it is less than this during your workout it is obviously too low). Pre-workout, most of my patients find if they go above 200-220mg/dl they do not feel like they have a lot of energy and then we will have to start checking for ketones when your blood sugar is above 250mg/dl. Of course, always speak with your physician/endocrinologist regarding your insulin adjustments and prior to starting any moderate to intense physical activity program.\n\nKeep up the great work and don't forget to check your blood sugars before, during and after your workouts while you are \"sorting\" out how to make your insulin adjustments.\n\nFeel free to ask me more questions!\n\nBest,\nCoachCDE\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Diabetes and Exercise","resp_content":"I use to do business with a brilliant dude that ran a highly successful wholesale supply company on the West coast.

Ask yourself, \"How's that 'label reading' working, so far?\" If label reading is so effective, if there are restaurants on every street corner in the city you live, what does this say about the fact that Type 2 Diabetes and obesity is continuing to rise, nationwide?\n\nThe point is, if you have significant inflammation, ongoing, it works against whatever exercise (and other weight loss efforts) you do. What this means is, \"lifestyle matters\".\n\nI can't comment on your particular situation because I don't have a clue what you're doing, what you're eating, how much stress you're under, how well you take care of your body, hell, your basic hygiene, even. All I can say is, I've been there done that. Weight loss is a very complex ordeal and requires great patience. You have to be highly diligent, disciplined and committed to your goals. Exercise is, without question, a critical and essential piece of the weight loss puzzle. And, of course, diet is even more important. But, the aging process makes fighting inflammation harder and harder. So, if you think that once you lose the weight you can relax and take your foot off the gas pedal, I've got bad news for ya...\n\nDon't do that! You must be on guard of your health, forever. It's that constant state of vigilance is how one achieves peace of mind.

What you and all readers must realized is that not all prescription plans cover the medications you are recommending, or are available at a very high cost. For example, the Glucobay you have repeatedly recommended is a Tier 3 drug in the formulary on our plan and would cost $31.00 per month once the $405.00 annual deductible for Tier 3 and higher medications has been met. Some drugs, such as the Tresiba, is simply not covered and would cost us hundreds of dollars per month.

I drink 3/4 of a liter, workout for one hour, drink 1/4 of liter of water, then, drink a cup of coffee, no sugar. If properly hydrated, you should pee all of this out in about 90-120 minutes. If not, you ain't \"properly hydrated\" (dehydration is at the core of most health issues, today).\n2. I thoroughly rinse my mouth out with warm water after eating. This limits bacterial growth in the mouth that destroys the enamel on teeth and can contribute to inflammation in the gut.\n3. Emotional wellness is good for the body. Maintaining a positive attitude and performing \"good deed(s)\" throughout the day places your mind (and body) in a good place.\n4. Scrub your skin when showering to exfoliate and open up skin pores.

But, what are common signs that suggest otherwise?\n\n1. Bad Breath: The smell (or stink) of your breath has a direct correlation with your health because it relates to certain bacterial flora that thrive in your mouth and g.i. tract. Diabetics have a very distinct and unpleasant smell and people with diabetes will often chew gum, frequently brush or use \"breath\" mints to mask foul odors.\nThis is a classic example, btw, of how modern medicine (drugs, quick fixes, \"health aids\") focuses on treating \"symptoms\". Instead of addressing the root cause (diabetes, poor diet, lack of exercise), we choose to \"mask\" stink-breath with antiseptics, toothpastes, tic-tacs and gum.\n\n2. Bad Teeth: Teeth problems start in the gums in the form of gingivitis. Gingivitis (gum disease) is reflective of poor health (developing cardiovascular issues, diabetes, hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise, SODAS / JUICE). Fact: The average adult between age 20 and 64 has three or more decayed or missing teeth! (Of course you know; this is a diabetes board, ain't it?) Haven't you noticed, when listening to the radio, how many dental ads played each hour? That's because dentists prefer to advertise on radio. And, as diabetes has exploded in numbers across America, proportionately so, has rotted and missing teeth. As long as people continue to eat faux food, get fat and refuse to regularly exercise, business will continue to thrive for the dental industry. btw, one of the best ways to teach your children how to be financially successful and have fewer money issues in life? All parents insist that graduating college is key. I have a better one:\n\nEat more fruits and vegetables.\n\nbtw, Do you ever wonder why the price of dental implants hasn't come down like, say, the cost of hearing aids and prescription eyeglasses? It's because, dentists and dental labs are smart. They know, precisely, where their bread is buttered (implants, crowns, dentures) and they will \"guard\" their livelihood (and the MBZs) with vim and vigor!\n\nBottomline: Truly \"healthy\" people don't pay mega bucks to dentists for implants, crowns and repeat dentures (because their anchors keep failing). When someone tells you they live \"healthy\", just look at their teeth. Do they smile, often? Or, are their teeth yellowed, chipped & crumbling? Are their gums any color other than bright pink? Please. Don't go around telling people how \"healthy\" you are if your teeth are clearly indicating, opposite.\n\n3. Eyes and Vision Fail: Good health is reflective of bright, clear eyes.\nConversely, if the eye whites are not bright white, that's reflective of faltering/failing health. Diabetes knows how to punish people for their procrastination and denial...it goes after the eyes. The eyes are the \"windows\". The eyes tell all you need to know about an individual's health. &, the eyes tell you whether you're winning of losing the war against diabetes. Same as dentists, business for ophthalmologists \"is-a-boomin'!\" If you don't eat right and you don't exercise, diabetes will slowly but surely ruin your eyes. All the meds, all the doctor visits, all the gimmicks and health aids, all the exercise equipment...this is why diabetes is 1/4 of a $TRILLION business! If your vision is worsening, well, guess what? You're treating \"symptoms\" and not attacking the root cause of Type 2 Diabetes, my friend. You want your \"cake and eat it, too\"? Nope. Uh-Uh. That's not how Type 2 Diabetes works. That's the beauty of diabetes: You can lie to everyone, else, but you can't lie to the bathroom mirror. If you want to save your sight (or keep what little you have remaining), meds will not save your eyeballs, sorry. You have to change your lifestyle.\n\n\nThere are many indicators of health. Weight is an obvious one. Weight can either increase, decrease of stay the same. Two out of the three are BAD (and unhealthy) and a sure sign of failing health. To be in good health means the body is static and stable...it's at \"peace\". Everything is working, efficiently and reliably. If you are overweight or obese, you still only have one heart, one liver, two kidneys, one G.I. tract and they are meant to maintain/operate ONE body, not one and one-half or two! Pimples and skin blemishes are another reliable indicator of a taxed/overworked immune system. Older adults with poor glucose control often look like they're going through puberty. Finally, frequent colds. If you get sick more than one or two times a year, you are not \"healthy\". You can say you are but you're in denial. And, just because you work closely with kids does not justify being sick more. Teachers are some of the most unhealthy people I've known, precisely, because they delude themselves into thinking, \"...Oh, it's normal to feel lousy multiple times a year because of my occupation...\" FAIL! It's not normal and, if you improved your health, you realize, lickity-split, there's nothing \"normal\" about getting sick, often, at all. Joint pain is a seldom discussed problem on this board but it's one of the biggest challenges of any diabetic in starting and maintaining a regular exercise program. How do you exercise when your body screams \"DON'T!\" It's a huge challenge to overcome.\n\nI mention these key \"signs\" because anyone who has overcome Type 2 Diabetes and reversed their \"disease\", without meds, will, all, tell the same exact story.

That way, all of us can benefit and feel better about ourselves and our families.\n\nHere's an example and one that may be of help to you. Good luck.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest problem areas affected by diabetes are your teeth and gums. If the dentist you're seeing has the latest technology in dental equipment, it can save you a lot of time, a lot of money and, most importantly, a lot of pain...\n\nHere's some examples:\n\n1. Digital x-ray: Dentists who do not have digital x-ray equipment are practicing in the dark ages. Digital x-rays use less radiation than film. They are easier to read and the ability to manipulate contrast makes diagnosis more accurate. This equipment is expensive.\n\n2. Ultrasonic Cleaning: Ultrasonic instruments vibrate plaque and calculus off your teeth, even in areas below your gums. It is much more comfortable than old-fashioned hand scraping. They can remove heavy stains (like tobacco and coffee) from the tooth and even treat periodontal disease. There is no excuse for not having it.\n\n3. CEREC: For many dentists, this is the information they don't want you to have. The CEREC system lets your dentist provide a ceramic crown, onlay or veneer in only one visit. Use of CEREC can conserve the tooth structure and permit the dentist to seal the tooth in one appointment. No gagging impressions. CEREC means fewer injections, less drilling and no annoying temporaries.\n\nThe big rub is cost. A CEREC system will cost around $120,000.\n\n4. Diagnodent: This is a laser which the dentist shines on the tooth and it tells whether there is a cavity and how deep it is. What's more, the laser can even tell your dentist that a root canal may be required. With the use of this technology, the dentist can detect cavities, and find them at an earlier stage, than traditional poking around the tooth (and no one likes that!).\n\n5. TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder): Did you know migraines and neck problems can be related to the position of your jaw? Your dentist should feel your joint and ask about any pain or discomfort you may be having.\n\n6. Advancements in oral cancer screening allow your dentist to find it sooner. A Vizilite exam is a detection tool used by dentists to see tissue changes in their earliest form. The dentist has you rinse with a solution and then shines a specially designed light in your mouth which will indicate the presence of oral cancer.\n\nhttps://www.aol.com/article/2009/08/27/secrets-your-dentist-doesnt-want-you-to-know/19134395/\n2\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?","resp_content":"Part A: Worrying About Type 2 Diabetes\n\nThere's over a 1000 posts on this board with, somewhere, it reads, \"...I'm worried...\"\n\nI understand why they feel that way...I've been in their shoes.

I'm old (61) & I've seen the \"consequences\" of poor choices and lack of (valid) information about type 2 diabetes. And, since Type 2 Diabetes, unquestionably, \"runs\" in families, there's high probability that these \"posters\" have seen it, too.

We have demonstrated that in many people who have had type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years, major weight loss returns insulin secretion to normal. It has been possible to work out the basic mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes. Too much fat within liver and pancreas prevents normal insulin action and prevents normal insulin secretion. Both defects are reversible by substantial weight loss...\"\n\n\"Can a Low-Calorie Diet Reverse Diabetes?\"\nhttp://www.diabetesincontrol.com/can-a-low-calorie-diet-reverse-diabetes/\n\"...What we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes, even if you have had the condition for a long time, up to around 10 years. If you have had the diagnosis for longer than that, then don’t give up hope – major improvement in blood sugar control is possible...\"\n\"...the study supported the researchers’ theory of a “Personal Fat Threshold”: “If a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate, then diabetes is triggered, but if they then lose that amount of weight, then they go back to normal. Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism – don’t forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes.”...\"\n\nDid you read the two articles, above? If so, what else are you \"worried\" about (your diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes)?\n\nHere's the bottomline:\n1. When you see your diabetes specialist and they explain the importance of diet and exercise in the treatment of this disease, don't ignore them! I find it ironic that everybody who posts, here, claims, \"I'm not overweight.\" Truth is 95% of all Type 2's are overweight or obese (that's 19 out of every 20 prediabetic/Type 2 Diabetic!). There is an overwhelming correlation between excess body fat and the development of T2 D! And, the point of these studies is clearly substantiating this premise: YOU LOSE SOME WEIGHT (5-10%), YOUR INSULIN RESISTANCE WILL DECREASE AND, EVENTUALLY, BLOOD SUGAR WILL NORMALIZE... In other words, any doctor that tells you the first line of defense in treating Type 2 Diabetes are drugs/insulin either, (1.) doesn't read, and or (2.) believes the \"old school\" notion that diabetes is a \"progressive\" disease and CANNOT BE REVERSED. And, you know what? If you take those prescribed drugs and ignore or marginalize the importance of weight loss, improved diet and daily exercise in treating this disease, your Type 2 Diabetes will, in fact, \"progress\" and deepen. How will you know this is has happened? Your drug(s) dosing will increase in order to reduce BS to acceptable levels.\n\nThe people who come here and say, \"I'm worried...\", they simply don't know that Type 2 Diabetes can be REVERSED. It is, in fact, not the least bit \"progressive\"! Lose some weight, eat right and exercise, then, call me liar.\nGo ahead, I dare you!\n\nI've mentioned this many times in the past...I believe Type 2 Diabetes is a \"beautiful\" disease because it allows each one of us an opportunity to measure our self worth and see just how much we care for this blessed gift we've been given: Our life. No one (besides us) can repair broken blood glucose regulation, no amount of money can make this journey any easier and it plays a level playing field regardless of race, creed, color, young or old, man or woman. With Type 2 Diabetes, if you put in the work, you will reap the benefits. You don't make an effort to lose the weight, eat, smart, and you will pay for your carelessness. Is it possible, that I'm the only one who sees the fairness and utter simplicity of this \"test\"? So, what is your life worth?\n\nStill \"worried\" about Type 2 Diabetes? That's cool.

No matter how many articles you read about Prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes Reversal, don't expect to see the words, \"fast\" or \"easy\". It's not easy! If done properly (long term), it's a difficult and arduous journey. Learning how to eat, correctly, & without added sugar and salt, is one of the toughest things you will ever do in life. I put it, above, beating alcoholism... graduating college...hell, raising two kids who graduated college. This is why gastric bypass may correct Type 2 Diabetes, \"fast and easy\". But, long term, G.B. most often fails because the patient will revert back to old eating habits. No surgery can correct what you load on your fork!\n\nReversing Type 2 Diabetes is an odyssey, requiring patience, discipline and self-worth. That's the beauty!

This was my response...\n\n\nI will try to explain why blood sugar rises in T2 Diabetics. Hopefully, by the end of this discussion, you'll refrain from asking \"what should I eat\" questions, forever.\n\nFirst, please read the following,\n\"Diabetes and Inflammation\"\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/inflammation-and-diabetes#1\n(I care not whether you believe what I say but once you read it, you will realize, I'm not pulling this stuff out of my *** and making it up as I go...)\n\nSo, now that you know there is a relationship between high blood sugar and the body's inflammatory response (agro immune system>>white blood cells sent>>release of \"cytokines\">>> yada, yada, yada...), there you go! Chemicals released from bloody fat cells causes inflammation>>>>blood sugar soars. Who knew?!?! So, brown rice causes inflammation (indirectly)! Hot-diggety-dog! Problem solved! I'm a genius!...\n\nBut, hold on...Not so fast.\n\nThere are many \"things\" that can illicit an inflammatory response besides pancakes, french fries, spaghetti, snickerdoodles and BROWN RICE (no matter how much you EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!).\n\nAgain, INFLAMMATION: occurs when chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues. It's designed to \"protect your body\" from \"foreign substances\" (ie. crap released from fat cells). These chemicals (cytokines) increase the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. So, in other words, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of fat cells because it can cause \"inflammation\" and, as a result, raise my blood sugar. BOO-HOO.\n\nOK, so being fat is not good. So, I'll lose some weight. That's why my doctor keeps badgering me. Now, it makes sense...\n\nJust one problem: To reiterate, there are many things (hundreds!!!!!!!!) that can/may cause short term or chronic inflammation. Here's a 1 minute sampling...\n\nbee stings\nyelling at your spouse or child\n(You spouse yelling at you,\nYou yelling at the driver in front of you,\nYou flipping the driver as you drive by,...)\nbruising your shin on the coffee table\nmedications your doctor prescribed to you (birth control, decongestants, vitamin B, steroids, barbiturates, etc, etc, etc)\nany drug you heard from a friend of a friend that lost 30 lbs in 30 days!\narthritis\nIBS\nHigh cholesterol\nHigh blood pressure\nauto-immune diseases\nmenstrual cramps\ntooth aches\ncolds and flus\npollen\npeanut butter\nhousehold cleaning products\ncosmetics\nridiculous, untested \"supplements\" you saw on Dr. _z or Dr. Ph_l or Dr. Who\ntooth aches\nmenopause\npoison oak\nflu shots\nantibiotics\nblood pressure meds\ncholesterol meds\nand, of course, \"brown rice\"\n\nSo, how in the world, would anybody (& their grandmother) know the cause of YOUR \"inflammation\" that resulted in your A1C going up? Sure, it could be all that brown sugar you ate. But, it could also be 10,000 other things!!!!! And, because you \"shared\" so much detailed medical information about yourself and family history, we have all the data needed to reach a definite, lock down, air tight conclusion...Yup. Has to be the \"brown rice\"!\n\n\n\nI don't mean to make light of your question...\n\nThe truth is: Each individual has a unique, one-of-a-kind, metabolic make-up and what is likely the cause of their uncontrolled blood sugar regulation is not one factor (brown rice) but the combination & strength of HUNDREDS of FACTORS (age, diet, weight, race, family history, environmental conditions, stress, co-morbidities, medications, social network, etc, etc).

Only a miniscule would ever even consider doing this! They could have incredible control of their disease in just 30 days. What a pity.\nReply\nnutrijoy\nover 2 years ago\nToo many people, patients and healthcare professional alike, tend to blame obesity as being the primary cause of T2 diabetes and, by association, the patient’s inability to control their appetite (i.e., overeating) or lack of sufficient exercise (i.e., slovenly lifestyle). I have never embraced that theory because I personally know lots of skinny T2 diabetics who are reasonably active but still come down with diabetes. Jenny Ruhl wrote an article many years ago that you can read on her website, BloodSugar101:\nhttp://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14046739.php\n\nIt was written quite a few years ago but has not gained much traction. Just shows that people just like to believe what they want to believe. But recent discoveries about the microorganisms which reside in our microbiome tends to toss the entire obesity theory on its head. It first began nearly a decade ago when doctors began experimenting with fecal/stool transplants to treat serious cases of IBS and infections of Clostridiuum difficile. The latter, in particular, is often resistant to conventional treatments, including antibiotics, and a fecal/stool transplant can literally be a life-saving procedure.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting. Quite a few years ago, I read about a woman who underwent the procedure and the donor was a cousin who was overweight/borderline obese. Shortly after receiving stool from her healthy but overweight cousin, her infection successfully went away but she began to suddenly and unexpectedly gain weight herself. Yet her diet and lifestyle were the same as it had been before the transplant. At the time, her doctor was at a loss for an explanation. But now hundreds of people who have received stool from overweight donors have also reported unexplained weight gain despite making zero changes in their diets or lifestyle activities. Clearly, something in the microbiome was causing the weight gain. You can easily read dozens, perhaps hundreds of reports of this phenomenon by simply typing “weight gain after stool transplant” into your favorite search engine.\n\nThis definitely suggests that something in the gut is responsible for this weird turn in events and has nothing to do with what a person eats nor how much they’re eating. Lifestyle also does NOT appear to be a factor in these cases of sudden weight gain; only that if the donor was obese, there’s a good chance that the recipient will become likewise. I could expand on this in greater detail, if you like, including the possible causes and the name of a microbe (found in the gut) that has been able to actually cause weight loss (special circumstances, of course) in the very limited experiments that have been done (so far). However, too many of my posts are too wordy than I prefer so I’ll end this post now. But … if those who read your thread want to know more, I’ll be happy to expand on this topic in a future post. Do, however, do your search for “weight gain after stool transplant” and read some of those articles first. They might answer most of the questions you might have regarding this microbiome-related phenomenon.\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?","resp_content":"This was posted by member, \"nutrijoy\", recently in another thread\"....\n\n“This TEDx talk by Dr. Sarah Hallberg is one that I recommend all PWDs should watch, whether they are Type 1, 2, 1.5 (LADA), MODY, or something undefined:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da1vvigy5tQ\n\nDr. Hallberg’s presentation is a shade over 18 minutes long but contains a wealth of solid information. I disagree with her video title about “reversing” diabetes but her suggestions are all pretty much spot on. Be sure to read some of the viewers’ comments posted on the YouTube page, however. The negative posts far outnumber the positives. Does that mean she is wrong or out-of-sync? Actually, as a seasoned veteran (over 15 years and counting) of insulin-dependent diabetes with an A1c under 5.4 during those many years, I can categorically state that the negative reviews come from people who either don’t have diabetes themselves or just don’t know the difference between their posterior orifice and a terrestrial aperture. But, I should add, that is only my personal opinion...\"\n\n\nI have referenced Dr. Hallberg's Tedx talk, several times, in my posts, as well.\nI, too, agree with nutrijoy that most of what she says is quite valid. The key point to her discussion is concerning the hormone, \"INSULIN\". Because most people will never bother to watch her Ted Talk discussion, allow me to highlight what she says about \"INSULIN\" in her discussion.\n\nA. \"Insulin's job is to drive blood sugar into the cells where it can be used.\"\nB. \"Most people who are obese are insulin RESISTANT...they have trouble getting blood sugar (into the cells) where it needs to go.\"\nC. \"The body's response to insulin RESISTANCE is to just make more of it and insulin levels will just rise and rise...\"\nD. \"More than 50% of the adult population now have either diabetes or prediabetes.\"\nE. \"People have elevated insulin levels due to insulin RESISTANCE for years and years, decades even, long before the diagnosis of even \"prediabetes\" is made...\"\nF. \"It's estimated that even 16 to 25% of \"normal\" weighted adults have insulin \"RESISTANCE\".\nG. \"So the problem with insulin resistance is, you are at \"great\" risk to developing diabetes...\"\nH. \"....but, also, insulin makes us HUNGRY!...Insulin is our FAT STORAGE hormone.\"\nI. \"Everything we eat is either a fat, protein or carbohydrate and each has a different affect on insulin...\"\nJ. \"When we eat fat, we get a flatline (it does nothing to insulin levels).\"\nK. \"So, if you're insulin RESISTANT and your insulin levels are already higher, you really are HUNGRIER...all the time!\"\nL. \"So, if you eat CARBS>>>Glucose goes up>>>Insulin goes up>>>Hunger & Fat Storage (results).\"\nM. \"The general recommendations for Type 2 Diabetes patients, today, is to consume 45-60 grams of carbohydrate per meal. We (doctors) are recommending to eat exactly what is causing our problem! Sound crazy? It really, really is!!!\"\nN. \"The American Diabetes Association guidelines specifically state, 'There is inconclusive evidence to recommend a specific carbohydrate limit and, since, carbohydrate intake is the single, greatest factor in blood sugar levels, we need medication (to treat diabetes).\"\nO. \"&, hey, look. If you're taking diabetes medications, you actually have to eat carbs! Otherwise, your blood sugar can go too low (hypoglycemic comatose)...\"\nP. \"So, here's the vicious cycle (of taking diabetes drugs prescribed by your physician) \"they\" set up for you: 1. Eat carbs>>>2. Take diabetes medicine>>>3. Eat MORE carbs to avoid going too \"low\" from taking the medication.............and, around and around and around we go!\"\nQ. \"No where in the ADA guidelines is the role of REVERSING Type 2 Diabetes!\"\nR. \"Our minimum daily requirement for carbohydrates? Zero...we don't need to eat carbohydrates.\"\nS. \"(Why the ADA guidelines in conflict with the latest studies in HIGH FAT/LOW CARB diets) Don't be fooled; There's a lot of money to be made by keeping you sick.\"\nT. \"So, the solution to the diabetes epidemic is becoming exceedingly clear: STOP USING MEDICINE TO TREAT FOOD.\"\n\nWhat I want to make clear to anyone reading this thread:\n1. I \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes almost 10 years ago and have not had a single A1C test result over 5.5 (5.3 in the last 5 years).\n2. I refused to take diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure drugs despite recommendations by my physician.\n3. I am still insulin resistant; I just don't \"test\" as T2 diabetes or prediabetes.\n4. Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes are as similar as dogs to cats. Type 1 diabetics cannot survive without insulin intervention. They need it because they don't produce enough (or any) to live!\n5. 95% of the diabetics in this country are TYPE 2. Type 1 Diabetes is rare compared to Type 2.\n6. As soon as changed my diet and improved the \"Basic\" of my lifestyle, my A1C dropped, IMMEDIATELY. Again, no drugs!\n\nSo, this is my \"soapbox\" (and, Dr. Hallberg's, of course). You ever wonder why you don't see the millions of other Type 2 diabetes viewing these threads on webmd, all over the world, chiming in to defend their \"treatment\" of T2D? How come no diabetes doctor's coming forward to call me a liar; That T2 Diabetes is NOT REVERSIBLE and cannot be eliminated without the use of diabetes medications?\n\nThus, push me off my soapbox. Share with us what you know. If you can call my advice \"worthless\", that's perfectly OK. But, at least have the stones, to share in your wisdom. That's the minimum price, at least, if you're going to criticize me.\nPS: My nephew and all his college buddies are presently consuming 3, 4 or 5 times the minimum ADA recommended carbohydrate levels per meal. They are young, strong and full of energy. They can operate on tilt, sunup to sundown, without a break. When they go for a doctor checkup, they never test for elevated fasting blood glucose. NEVER...\n\nSo, tell me. Does that mean they're \"safe\"? Must be...that's what their doctor tells 'em.\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?","resp_content":"Almost 9 out of 10 Type 2 Diabetics are overweight. Losing just 5 to 10% bodyweight could mean the difference between taking diabetes medications or controlling the disease (and possibly reversing it, entirely) through diet and exercise. In other words, \"bodyfat\" loss is closely tied to insulin resistance and, more often than not, the key to resolving T2D.\n\nSo, if that's the case, what's the big deal? Lose weight and normal blood sugar regulation is restored. Easy, right?\n\nWrong! Permanent weight loss is the Holy Grail of medicine. If I could put fat loss in a bottle, I could make Bill Gates my regular Uber driver. I could make Warren Buffet my private shopper. I could make Vladimir Putin fetch my morning paper.\n\nHere's my secret to weight loss. It's so stupid easy, too...\n1. Lots of water\n2. Daily exercise\n3. Eat the same healthy things, morning noon and night.\n\nSalmon. Eggs. Sweet potato. Avocado. Broccoli. Cherries. Walnuts. Cabbage. Beans. Spinach. Apples. Bone broth... It doesn't matter, just as long as it's a fresh whole food. I don't even put a limit on how much I eat! I can eat until I gag...as long as it's the same healthy thing...everyday...morning, noon and night.\n\nIf every Type 2 Diabetic just bit the bullet, the disease would vanish. So would High Blood Pressure. So would coronary artery disease. No more stroke or heart attacks. No more cancer. If I was president, I'd put this in the tax code!

Ask any diabetes physician. They will concur. If you make minor improvements to your lifestyle, you will see the difference in your blood sugar reads, immediately.\n\n\nBut, that's not what Type 2 Diabetics are told to \"focus\" on...They're told to control high blood sugar through drugs. And, by doing that rather than investing their entire effort into eating, fresh and non-processed, and walking, everyday and drinking way more water than they're drinking, now...They get \"worse\". Type 2 Diabetes is allowed to progress.\n\nDo you wanna know what Type 2 Diabetes can do to your body when it's allowed to progress? Do you have any idea? Unless you work in an E.R. and see the results of uncontrolled blood sugar on a routine basis, you wouldn't know the devastation this disease can manifest.\n\nRead each and every post, here, and you will see. 99% are essentially, clueless. They simply don't know what to do. They are barking up every wrong tree except weight loss! If people did know (how to correctly treat T2D), why in the world would they need this board? Answer: People don't know a thing about Type 2 Diabetes. That's why.\n\nAnd, the same posts are repeated year after year after year. Nothing that's asked, here, today, is any different than what was asked 20 years ago. They spin their wheels researching drugs and sham supplements and insipid health aids, instead. They go on \"diets\" every six months. They make New Year resolutions that never last. People don't ever consider to eat the same thing, everyday...just like every other animal on the face of this planet! That just makes too much sense to wrap their brains around.\n\nAnd, you know what? Despite however easy it is to \"cure\" this disease (and every other horrid lifestyle disease) for the rest of their lifetime, people will go on measuring their \"blood sugar\" and continue to take the pills, regardless of outcome. As long as they refuse to lose the weight, permanently, as long as they deny the connection between weight gain and insulin resistance, as long as they remain ignorant of the link between metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes, diabetes will continue to be big business.

The difference is that a diabetic's blood glucose will remain high and not go back down to \"normal\" levels as quickly or easily.

To know how much or how little you can eat, you need to test after meals and see how the known amount of food affected you (like that 35 g of carb you mentioned).

The diabetics by individualized do\nunderstand to get more for the money, where in reality just get less.\nIn the diabetes industry the money is not made by the medications,\nbut by the many additional disorders possible and like that by the\nCrookies get strategically supported, as also by such as the ADA in\nits constant conflicts of interests where it get the donations and the\nsponsors money from of annually over $ 24 Millions to know well.\nThe above mentioned Dr. Lady study mentioned that the hardliner\nto handle the diabetes at lower A1C do apply a more strict nutrition\ndiet with less carbon hydrates. That the more strict nutrition Diet does\nalso provide less Vitamins and Essential Minerals as for example the\nPotassium important for heartbeat, without it there is no beat possible,\nabout this so important the Dr. Lady is not mentioning anything, funny!\nUntil today there is not any study existing where the Potassium independent\nof the kind of applied Diet or A1Cs is kept stabile at about 4.4 mmol/l to\navoid or compare heart complications.\nAs by myself I could experience, one day I did have my SIS pressure up-to\n150-160 I went to emergency and my doctors worried, but at the time as I\ncould find-out the Potassium was only at about the minimum of the normal\nand so I applied the Potassium supplementing as at Google “Twitter WDHCO”\ntopic 17. and within about 3 months my Heart conditions normalized back to\nthe very good levels as it has been all my life and my Basal-Insulin dose also\ngot only halve by the same fasting Glucose setting at 80-90 mg/dl.\n\nAbout this above can now everybody form its own conclusions!\n\nThecynic – Here I like to provide you something you can do by yourself\nat weekly base by your hands and eyes like the old doctors did.\nIts known that all additional possible diseases are mainly caused by the\nmicro-macro-vascular disorders as well by all details described and even\nby some electron-microscopy picture shown or nih.gov links at WDHCO\ntopic 1., to know that the capillary veins have a diameter of 1/100 of a\nmillimeter only by its need to let pass red-blood bodies with a diameter\nof 6-8/1000 of a millimeter, which by none of any Sonography or MRI\ncan been seen because too small to see and where only the possible\ncomplications as result can been seen.\nThis where the red-blood bodies need to supply the body-cells with oxygen\nand the blood with nutrients for the body-cells able to live, not die and to\nexist in good conditions.\nWe have to imagine that all the blood from the heart need to pass the\ncapillary netting spread across the body parts and organs, before the\nblood can go back to the heart for the cycle to start all over again.\n\nHere how to find-out about the sneaky micro-macro-vascular disorders\nby some simple method from the time the doctors did touch patients:\n1. With the hands feel the temperatures of the legs calf and compare\nto the feet, where there should be no temperature difference or nearly\nnone if everything is OK! (Feet colder means attention.)\n2. With the eyes checking if some veins at the feet can been seen if\nthe feet are not swollen and checking if the skin did not partially turn\nreddish (any inflammations caused by micro-macro-vascular?) to be OK!\n3. With a ball-pen at the foot-solen and toes-underside, gently touching\nto create a tickling-feeling and if everywhere it is possible to have the\ntickling, it means everything is OK without any neuropathies caused by\nmicro-macro-vascular disorders!\nIf cannot get the tickeling-feeling and just the ball-pen pressure can be\nrealized or partially not even that, then it means it’s not OK.\n4. If there are some problems on the feet, we can assume to have also\nproblems somewhere else in the body.\n\nI hope this is helpfully for you.\n\nHappy Day – Cherry\nReply\nthecynic\nover 2 years ago\nHi Cherry99, the health field is very complicated because there is so much different opinion documented by health business, you mention that diabetes medication is not the cause of money corruption, but for the additional disorders which allows the doctors to prescribe more medication, I see no difference paying for new mediations that are not branded against diabetes, its more corruption for the health business.

Gluconat is sugar and to simulate the\nnatural it’s good to have some minerals by a sugar-compound to\nbe bio-active. Mangan is useful for the body’s cartilage at joints\nto repair and to reduce age related hearing losses.\nThe Mangan is also harmonizing, supporting the Glucose Metabolism.\n\nPhosphor-Calcium daily 30mg. The Phosphor is essential for the\nNeurons in the brain to jump as necessary to have the brain\nfunctioning and resulting for the body’s motoric.\nThe Phosphor by a calcium-compound to simulate the natural to\nbe bio-active. The Neurons in the brain are similar like the electricity\njumping at sparkplugs in the engine and we know without sparks\nno engine can run.\nBy taking this it can be felt, that the talking and walking get\npossibly a little faster, easier and the awareness improved.\n\nThese 2 Minerals I also take daily because it helps.\n\nHappy Day – Cherry\n"},{"author":"brunosbud","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Diabetic since 1994","resp_content":"thecynic, unfortunately, I am not understanding of your initial posting.

Now that I understand your history at bit better, here's a few thoughts...\n1. You're a few years my elder, nevertheless, we share a common experience.\nI believe: You don't \"treat\" Type 2 Diabetes! You improve and restore the body's health and the body will do all the necessary \"treatment\".\n2. Why did the other conditions I had on our \"laundry\" list of ailments seem to resolve themselves once I \"reversed\" my T2D (T2D, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, obesity, osteoarthritis, gastric reflux, sleep apnea, pollen allergies, sick multiple times every year)?\nAnswer: Because they all share the same root cause: Chronic inflammation.\nAll these \"conditions\" are related. Since they share the same root cause, they are simply different metabolic \"expressions\".\n\nIn other words, I'm a \"cynic\" just like you. This board is filled with what I call, blood glucose \"manipulators\"...experts on metformin, insulin and other insulin affecting drugs. They preach that the key to treating Type 2 Diabetes is to lower blood glucose to \"acceptable\", \"normal\" levels.\n\nWhat I learned is \"that\" is what the medical profession \"want\" us to believe. That it is beyond our capacity to heal, ourselves. That hypertension, high cholesterol, autoimmune disease, arthritis, cancer, kidney disease are all different and unique conditions requiring the services of a different \"specialist\" and, in turn, we need to swallow 5, 8, 15 different drugs, daily!\n\nI don't know if you believe, same as I do. To a point, I don't think it really matters. At this point in my 62 years, I am free of all medical supervision and I will never go back. I practice preventative medicine, now, and I am at total peace with that decision. But, with one difference from you, though. I am no longer a \"cynic\". I understand why physicians practice medicine in the manner they do, today.

Should I also consult Gastroenterologist?\n\n-Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups.\n\nFew doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms.\n\n********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? **********\n\n\nI wonder now why no doctor asked to check his \"cortisol\" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress?\n\nAny other important factors to test for his stress levels?\n\nIs ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important?\n\n**********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS**********\n\n\nMedications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months\n\n-Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal]\n\n-Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal]\n\n-Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal]\n\n-Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety\n\n-RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks.\n\n\n******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY*******\n\nThese are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc.\n\n-COEZIDAY 100mg 1x\n\n-CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg]\n\n-GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x\n\n-GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x\n\n-DISPIRIN 300mg 1x\n\n-ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID]\n\n\n**********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS**********\n\nA very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low.\n\nDrinking warm water helps a little bit as well.\n\n\n\nPlease tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well.\n\nI can of course provide more info if needed.\n\nAny help will be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much again.","like_count":"0","tags":["Insulin","Treatments","Type 2 Diabetes"]},"responses":[{"author":"cherry99","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Help needed, father continuous painful hiccups for over a year","resp_content":"[deleted]\n"},{"author":"cherry99","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"If it is to inflammations related, Google “Twitter WDHCO” and","resp_content":"see topic 17.

That’s not good.\n\nPer 2lbs bodyweight it needs 0.75g Protein and the best source of\nProtein is fresh Egg-White mixed in water to drink. One Egg-White\nhas about 9 grams of Pure-Protein depending on the size of Egg.\nAdd 2 Teaspoons of the Yellow to let it remain liquid at mixing.\n(As vegetarian your B12 is possibly also too low, be carefully.)\n\nWith this Protein maybe your fasting Glucose will get reduced\nand don’t forget to eat daily also 2 Bananas, that’s no joke.\n\nWhen my diabetes started I was in the similar situation as you now.\nDid have fasting Glucose 115-120, but being a little underweight means\nI could not take Metformin what’s the best to control or reduce the\nGlucose from the liver, because by Metformin the body will lose weight.\nResulting together with my doctor decided to use “Toujeo” the 24 hour\nBasal-Insulin and started daily by 6 U where by the producer info\n8-10 U is usually the applied minimum dose and I got to 8 U to keep\nit below 100mg/dl at about 85-90 for the honeymoon period until\nsome actions got into my diabetes where I ended-up with 23 U at\npeak and together with the doctor decided that this is too much\nand not even possible to control everything as necessary and so\nadjusted it to 18-20 U fasting Glucose 85-90mg/dl and additionally for\nthe meals to handle got the Novo-Rapid Insulin and it was good so.\nDuring the last 3 months I’m daily supplementing with 900mg Potassium\nSlow-K (equal 2 Bananas) and as very happy by this I could drastically\nreduce my Insulin consumption from “Toujeo” 18-20 U daily to 6-7 U.\n\n\nThis here to give you some more detailed impressions and about what\nyou may should talk with your doctor to decide, beside of further\nnecessary tests to evaluate your kind of diabetes.\nDon’t wait until diabetes confirmation, the defects start already at\npre-diabetes and even the ADA agree to start therapy the sooner\nthe better it is!\n\nHappy Day\n1\n"},{"author":"mrscora01","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Pre-diabetic active vegetarian","resp_content":"Have you been checked for type 1 (antibody testing)?

At the time, I knew that was a pathetic state to be, but I endured it, nonetheless.

I haven't failed an A1C in 10 years and stopped checking blood sugar several years, back. T2 D is a result on chronic inflammation, hormonal changes coming from advancing age and poor lifestyle fundamentals in rest and stress management. You can \"reverse\" obesity.

This is what you're (and your md are) doing, now. You're reacting to a \"diagnosis\". What you don't realize is your body has been incubating the condition known as T2D for years, possibly decades.

Then, you will see just how many houses are burning down (systematic med dose increases)and most of them believe they are following \"doctor's orders\".\n\nAccountable means, \"Are my symptoms getting better or are they getting worse?\" Just ask yourself this question, \"Why are 80% of the T2 D/Prediabetes diagnosis occur after age 45?\" What does that tell you?

In fact, the principals to beating all three are the same, cherry. I will tell you with out reciting any studies or articles, too (because you lose 99% of the readers when you do that).\n\nSmoking is essentially \"nicotine resistance\".\nAlcoholism is nothing more than \"alcohol resistance\"\nSo, what is Type 2 Diabetes? Type 2 Diabetes is \"insulin resistance\".\n\nWhen you become addicted to any drug, the key to \"kicking the habit\" is to drastically lower or stop exposure to the drug, entirely, at which point you \"regain\" sensitivity.\n\n1. I stopped smoking cigarettes. I'm no longer addicted to nicotine. I am nicotine sensitive, now. (yay!)\n2. I stopped drinking alcohol. I'm no longer addicted to alcohol. I am alcohol sensitive, now. (yay!)\n3. By \"reducing\" insulin through diet, exercise, water, sleep and many other lifestyle changes, I'm no longer Type 2 Diabetic. By reducing insulin, I've become \"insulin sensitive\", again. (yippee-kai-yay...!)\n\nIf what you say is true, cherry, then why not have all T2 Diabetics shooting up insulin? If more insulin is \"anti-inflammatory\" why beat around the bush with metformin and \"diet and exercise\"? Why not send all T2 newbies home with insulin pens from the get-go?\n\nHere's another way of looking at it...\nWhy does \"fasting\" work so beautifully with Type 2 Diabetes?\nWhy does weight loss work so effectively in reducing insulin resistance?\nWhy has gastric bypass surgery (where stomach size is shrunk to 1/10 its size) been observed to make Type 2 Diabetes miraculously disappear well before most weight is loss?\nWhy does a ketogenic diet (high fats, no carbs) reduce blood sugar, within the first couple2 weeks of use?\nWhat do all four of these examples have in common?\n\nEat less (or eat no carbs)...use drastically LESS insulin...regain \"insulin sensitivity\". A1C and fasting blood glucose return to normal levels.\n\n\n\nThis is what I \"did\". No links to studies. No medical mumbo-jumbo. Its been 10 years; I stopped testing my own BS at home 3 years, ago. There's no point to do so, anymore. It's good. Every time...\n\nSo, go ahead and take more insulin if you like. You don't need to, actually. Just ask any insulin users, here, how \"anti-inflammatory\" their lives are. Just ask them what dosing MORE INSULIN has done to their body?...Their kidneys...Their eyes...Their joints and muscles...Their bladder and stomach...Their teeth...Their ears...Their fingers and toes...\n...Forget the studies! Take a poll!\n\nWhat we are talking about, here, is the fundamental problem with how Type 2 Diabetes is treated in America. People are not being instructed how insulin resistance develops and worsens! Diabetes drugs can help us reduce blood sugar to normal levels, sure, and that's a \"good\" thing. But, if you don't eat properly and \"rely\" on drugs to knock high glucose levels, down, you are advancing your body's \"insulin resistance\". That's a \"bad\" thing.\n\nType 2 Diabetes is when your body's cells have built a \"resistance\" to insulin.\nThis is the phenomenon known as \"insulin resistance\".\n\nHow did I \"reverse\" my insulin resistance? I went low carb, low sugar, high fat. In a nutshell, I used LESS insulin!!!! I don't need to rethink this.

So, I decided to rebuild my body. Transform it from a fat, overweight, surly, impatient lump into a well oiled machine.

About three months of the year, it eat avocados. Lots and lots of avocados. Morning, noon and night. Throughout the year, I also eat lots of celery with peanut butter. Two, three stalks, a day. I've been doing this for many years, now, and what I observe is pretty consistent, every time...\n\nI lose weight. 10 pounds, sometimes more.\nI normally weigh about 175. I'm 5'10\" and, though, my weight loss is not noticeable to others, it's obvious to me.\nWhat also occurs during my avocado \"season\", my blood pressure goes down and so does my blood sugar, too.\n\nThe beauty of this diet change is it's simplicity. There's no cooking avocados or celery. There's no work.\n\nWhat has this diet taught me?\n\n1. Weight gain is due to water retention. Your body needs to retain water to help calm inflammation. Therefore, the cleaner and fresher my diet becomes, the less water my body retains. Just a single gallon at sea level weighs.............\n........8.5 lbs!\n2. Inflammation not only is a major cause of weight gain, it affects every other key vital, namely, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar.\nThis explains why gastric bypass patients can \"lose\" their high blood pressure and diabetes literally \"overnight\" (after operation). They can't eat crap, anymore (sugar, carbs, red meat, diet sodas, \"lunchables\", cereal, pasta, sourdough bread, etc...)\n\nThey can try. But, the most they can handle is a bite, maybe two. This means their entire G.I. tract gets a 6 month Hawaiian vacation to rest and heal. This means they can't \"sabotage\" themselves.\n3. Fiber is your stomach's friend. People that eat food with labels have a entirely different gut flora (bacteria) than people that don't. The more fiber you eat (fruits and vegetables) the less inflammation your body will experience through digestion and sleep. The less inflammation your body needs to \"repair\" each day, the sooner your health can be restored. Bacteria outnumber the number of human cells in a human body, 10 to 1. This means some bacteria is good and some bacteria is bad and what you eat determines which ones decide to take up residence inside you.\n4. It's not too much sugar that ruins lives. Just ask any woman Type 1 Diabetic how they feel about \"insulin\". The more they use, the fatter they get.\nThey do not like that. High insulin is inflammatory!\n\nI don't \"recommend\" diets to, anyone, anymore. There's no point. If you don't understand the \"why\" (you're doing something), you will not continue (to do it).\n\nYou \"think\" your overweight is due to diet. You \"think\" your diabetes is due to diet. You \"think\" your hypercholesterolemia is due to diet. So, let me ask you a question: If all of these \"bad health problems\" are all due to poor diet, why hasn't somebody come up with a diet that improves all three?\n\nThey have, dear.

We can't grow back fingers or toes and neither can we grow back islet cells.\n\nThe sad truth is that as many as 50% of T1s diagnosed in emergency rooms had doctors visits the week before.\n\nI just want to add, that you seem to be confusing T2 and T1. Your talk of weight and diet and exercise have nothing to do with T1.

Health is like Alice's rabbithole. It is infinite in depth and the deeper you go, the more secrets you learn...about sleep...about exercise...about water...about stress...and, about FOOD!\n\nEvery person's diet is a intricate series of \"choices\". We make a multitude of both positive and negative choices, every freaking day. Pluses and minuses, 24/7/365. In simplistic terms, food can be destructive and inflammatory or it can be constructive, nutritious and anti-inflammatory.\n\nBlood sugar spikes are just a reaction to inflammation, my friends. That's all it is. You are making more poor choices than good.\n\nTherefore, any conversation about diet cannot be just about \"what foods should we eat\" without talking about \"what foods shouldn't we eat\". Because, here's the bottom line when it pertains to \"high\" blood sugar. Your lifestyle has more red on it's ledger (inflammation) than it does blue. In other words, for every step forward you gain for a healthy bite, you're more than likely, taking two steps back for two unhealthy ones. There will never be a magic bullet concocted for diabetes because medicine can't overcome every and all poor choice(s) in a individual's life.\n\nThis is the rabbit hole I speak of. This is what I refer to as \"lifestyle\". Every uncontrolled Type 2 is essentially shooting themselves in the foot. They are putting holes in their boat. They have seen the enemy and, it is them. Their \"inflammation\" is showing.\n\nYou take better care of yourself, your body WILL respond. Guaranteed. You make better choices (in place of the pss-poor ones you're make, now), you will glimpse \"cure\". This is the beauty of good health. That's the beauty of the human body. Thus, that's the beauty of diabetes. It is totally fair...just pluses and minuses, a zero sum game. You can be on the road to recovery, or the guillotine, with every decision you make. Choice is yours.\n\nSo, it doesn't matter how critical or insensitive jerks (like me) can be to you, your body NEVER JUDGES! Whether you care to acknowledge it, food is medicine. And, it is also poison. The choice is yours. The knowledge is available at your fingertips. Go down the rabbithole or remain ignorant...\n\nHow cool and fair is that? Take \"care\", please. Good luck\n1\n"},{"author":"hecardo","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Out of the Blue...","resp_content":"Cathy I was diagnosed 2 years ago as a type 1 at the age of 58.

It was for me. I was diagnosed T1 about 5 years ago. To say it was a transition was putting it mildly. I am disabled, so I am limited in exercise choices, and have a lot of allergies so it can be a pain to get fresh air exercise. I had to find a gym that could accommodate my disabilities and a trainer that was experienced in working with the disabled. Thankfully the VA was able to help with the cost or I'd be in the poor house by now. But anyway, when I started, my A1C was 9.6, and my BS was often in the high 200's. I had to not only change the way I ate, I had to retrain my whole family on how to cook and eat, and how to shop for those days when I wasn't able to do it myself.\nYou already have that advantage, you have a healthy lifestyle. Now it's a matter of Carbs vs. Exercise vs. Insulin and when to do each. The best thing to do, is start a food journal that records your blood sugars, as well as your exercise routine (walking, gym, whatever). Your endocrinologist will probably tell you how many times a day to test, but I started with as soon as I woke up so I got my fasting sugar, before every meal, then 2 hours after every meal, and right before bed. I noted the times what my BS was and what I had eaten. It was the only way I could figure out what was causing the highs and lows.\nFor example, for breakfast I had always had 8 oz of orange juice, and my sugars were always really high. For 3 days I skipped the OJ and my sugars were ok. So I changed the OJ I was used to and switched to a no sugar added, non concentrate, as fresh as possible, and my sugars were still high, so now it is a treat I get only on vacation once in a while.\nThere are all kinds of things that I gave up, or only have on a cheat day. A lot of times if you forbid something all together, they become something you will crave until you gorge. If you cheat once in a while, i.e. once every month you can have a treat, then you don't break the diet.\nNow I've lost 40 lbs, still have 5 to go, but my A1C is 5.6 and my sugars are very rarely above 160.\nIt's a balance of carbs. Oh by the way, when a food says sugar free, it doesn't mean it's completely sugar free. Check your labels. Under Carbohydrates the sugars could read Sugar Alcohol. This is sugar, just according to the FDA, it is not an actual food, so it doesn't count. It still affects the carb numbers.\nGood luck and God Bless.\n"},{"author":"chocolaholic77","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Out of the Blue...","resp_content":"I understand completely how you feel.

Not only have I not failed a blood sugar test in a decade, I haven't had a cold in countless years. Nor a headache or sore throat. I don't even see a doctor, anymore, unless for sporadic checkups (now, maybe once every three years?). There's no need. I know and understand the \"warning system\" of the human body, ie. \"symptoms\" that reveal the genesis of developing disease or \"compromises\" of my defenses.\n\nMost of all, I understand the difference between normal, \"acute\" inflammation and chronic, long term inflammation that causes diseases like Type 2 Diabetes to develop. Chronic inflammation is at the root of every single lifestyle disease, today. Cancer, hypertension, arthritis, glaucoma...they are simply different \"expressions\" of the same root cause: A weakened immune system caused by chronic, systemic inflammation. Why do some people look their age where others can pass for their kids brothers and sisters?\nTake a guess. I believe aging is a disease that can be \"reversed\", too. Does your age affect the bruise on your knee or your Type 2 Diabetes?\n\nDoes a bear...?\n\nAnything that \"taxes\" your immune system affects all other ongoing conditions in your body. This is why your blood sugar may flair because of the \"boo-boo\" on your knee. Your immune system is in inflamed and, presently, addressing infection at the injured area. Will this compromise your body's ability to regulate blood sugar?\n\nDoes a bear fart in the woods?\n\nDo hospitals refrain from performing surgery when a patients diabetes is uncontrolled? Yup. You should google the word \"sepsis\" oand how many people die from it each year in hospitals each year.\n\nYou got it wrong. The bruise and diabetes are both affected at the same time because they are both regulated by the same \"mother\"...your immune system.\n\nThis is how I \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes. It's the day when I realized I needed to stop \"treating\" my Type 2 Diabetes and focus on improving my \"health\". This is the nasty, dirty secret that nobody in the medical community wants you to know. This is why they eliminated P.E. in schools. This is why we're forced to endure these lame TV commercials showing \"gorgeous\" older men and women blissfully prance around because they take the latest diabetes \"wonder\" drug (that hasn't been recalled, yet).\n\nAnd, this is why you asked this question. Because, there's big money to be made from people who are old and in poor \"health\". I'm 61 yo and I had to learn this life lesson on my own. Because, healthcare does not want you (and, more importantly, your kids) to know the answer to your question.\n\nPS: One of my dogs was suffering from diarrhea, recently. It was sporadic and unpredictable. This was killing me because I had to take him outside at god-awful times in the middle of the night and it's not safe because we have coyotes wandering all over the neighborhood, then. I could have taken him to see a vet but I knew all they would do is prescribe an anti-diarrheal (ie. \"imodium\") because my dogs are well cared for and in peak health, most times. It took me close to a month to figure out what was wrong but I finally nailed it. Did you know that bloody stools can be caused by a simple ear infection? And, he never had this problem, before, even though I've been treating his ear mites for YEARS?\n\nDid you know that perfectly healthy seniors can die within days from a simple uterine tract infection or a tooth ache?\n\nIt's all stems from the same bowl of fruit. Sadly, it's so much easier to \"treat\" diabetes than it is to drink only water or stop eating bread with a meal. That's what it really comes down to.

I am new to WebMd but am a insulin dependent type 1 diabetic for over 20 yrs. I do not have any heart issues, not when I was shooting insulin or on the pump as now. For you to consider to stop taking insulin is shocking. A doctor prescribed it so it's medically needed. Sounds like your body can't handle large doses; test that theory by giving yourself (in your 10 unit example) 5 units with another 5 in 30 minutes. Your doctor put u on 70/30 after your telling him u can't afford pump supplies. You could inquire to go on straight NPH rather than a pre-mix but if your A1-C is good on 70/30 continue just break up your doses. In honesty when I was shooting 3x a day I used the same syringe; now on the pump I change infusion set every 6 days instead of 3.\nNeither case is ideal but since insurance calls the 'supplies' durable equipment I need to pay 20% so this way a 90 day supply becomes a 180 day supply about $15.00 a month. I know this was an unconventional response but if splitting doses by syringe doesn't work don't take risk with your heart. Go back on the pump & stretch your supplies out; better than stopping for sure as you can die whether it be the heart or keto.

As you dig deeper into the relationship of these three terms, you will learn there's a connection between high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes! They are all related through \"metabolic syndrome\" and they are all just \"symptoms\" of developing \"insulin resistance\".\n\nIt clearly states in the article that an individual can be insulin resistant yet show no signs of Type 2 Diabetes. I am, in fact, such a person. I use to be diabetic but I \"reversed\" it. I have not failed a blood sugar test (fasting or A1C) in over 10 years.\nAm I insulin resistant? Hell, yes.\nAm I still Type 2 diabetic? Not to my doctor, I'm not.\nDo I have metabolic syndrome. Nope. I use to be. But, when I reversed my Type 2 Diabetes and lost 44 pounds, my blood pressure and triglycerides all reduced to normal levels.\n\nimho, there isn't a person consuming a Western diet, that is not \"developing\" insulin resistance. High levels of insulin circulating in the bloodstream is the indicator that insulin resistance is \"incubating\". When people disregard their diet, ignore developing signs of inflammation, fail to exercise, regularly, that's when insulin resistance can advance to prediabetes and, eventually, T2 Diabetes.\n\n2 out of 3 adults in the US are overweight.\nDo they all have diabetes? No, not at all.\nBut, are they developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome? You betcha!\nThey all think they're \"safe\" because they don't show high blood sugar numbers. Little do they know, it's just a matter of time.\n\nThis is why I refer to Type 2 Diabetes is a spectrum disease: Everybody walks the same insulin resistance \"highway\". The further up the road, the greater your body's cells become resistant to insulin and, eventually, blood glucose begins to whack out.\n\nThis is not meant to scare you or anybody reading this. In fact, you should take comfort in knowing two things:\n1. Everybody's in the same boat, and\n2. The Type 2 Diabetes highway runs forwards and backwards! I'm living proof that that's true.

You see, a Type 2 diagnosis is fast approaching end stage uncontrolled blood glucose regulations. The present day criteria of when you \"need\" to do something about your developing diabetes is, laughably, far too late! It's 12:00 and the bar closes at 2:00. It's the 4th quarter in the Superbowl. Should you suspect you have diabetes because you have a \"sweet taste in your mouth\"?\n\ngood grief, you should suspect you have diabetes when you wake up every morning and pour that first cup of coffee! Understand the diabetes \"risk factors\". Then, explain them to your kids. Lose the weight. Stop eating out and learn to cook healthy meals. Manage your stress. Exercise, daily, and \"prepare\" for your sleep, every night, as if your life depended on it. It does.\nUnderstand that preventative medicine is not on anybody's agenda for good reason. People want your hard earned money and, right now, taking it from you is like shaving sheep. Let's all say, baaaaaaahhhhhh.\n\nSomeday, doctors and hospitals will go the way of the video store and photo developers . It's not gonna be in time to save this generation. Or, my kids. Or, my grandkids...Nope. It won't come in time to save them. But, someday, kids will be taught, in school, that diet, exercise and lifestyle matters.

A recent studied showed that after about 6 months or a year, lchf patients when compared to the low fat crowd, did about the same in all their metrics. Except in a few areas, the lchf did better.\n\nRegarding cholesterol, the lc people didn't have their cholesterol drop quite as much as the low fat folks, but that was only at the beginning. By the end of the study, they had pretty much the same good chl profile, except the lc people tended to have lower triglycerides.\n\nApparently in the weight loss department, lc people lost more weight. As it was not a long term study, they didn't know who kept it off better. I have seen quite a few T2s maintain good weight loss by sticking to this.\n\nIt is excellent for bg numbers - better than high carb low fat people tend to be as even carbs with a lot of fiber will spike your bgs.\n\nDr Bernstein was the first lchf guru - but many people only use him as a guideline as his mode of this diet is very, very, very extreme. I personally couldn't live on only 30g of carb per day. Nor would I want to.\n\nBut following this plan will definitely help keep your blood sugars in check. It appears to be that the combination of the carbs and the fat (think pizza with lots of cheese, etc) are what is really horrible for your health.\n\nMy Dad follows a low carb diet and has done amazingly well for the last 40 years. But that is what suits him and his lifestyle. You will have to find what works for you.

If you just found out you were diabetic yesterday, do you know whether you were diagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2? If you're concerned about ketone levels, you can purchase a product called Ketostix in virtually an pharmacy/drug store. It is an over-the-counter product and is a urine-based test.

Usually you can obtain one from your doctor for free (usually includes ten starter test strips). They can also be purchased from any drug store without a prescription but the strips can be expensive without insurance. I recommend people who pay-out-pocket to go for the Accu-Chek Guide meter and strips. You can get the meter free and test strips are reasonably priced under their SimplePay program:\nhttps://www.accu-chek.com/microsites/guide-simplepay?utm_campaign=Guide&;utm_medium=Inactive_URL&utm_content=ACCM/microsites/guide/simplepay.html&utm_source=Inactive_URL\n\nI use these myself and I buy 300 strips at a time for $69 (meter is free).

See if you can make an appointment with an endocrinologist. This doctor specializes in diseases of the hormones, which includes insulin.\nBlood sugar problems have numerous forms:\n\nType 1 Diabetes: Usually called Juvenile Diabetes, most are born with this. Or have converted from,\n\nType 2 Diabetes:\n\nInsulin Resistance: (This is straight from WebMD website)\nWhat is insulin resistance? Does it mean you're going to get type 2 diabetes?\nIf your doctor has told you that you have this condition, you're probably asking these questions.\nIt means your body can't respond properly to the insulin it makes. Over time, this sends your blood sugar levels up. That can set you up for type 2 diabetes, as well as heart disease, but it doesn't have to. Exercise and a good diet can help you stay healthy.\n\nHypoglycemia: (This is quoted directly from WebMD)\nHypoglycemia is low blood sugar. It is considered a symptom, not a disease. Hypoglycemia most commonly occurs in people who take certain diabetes medications. However, low blood sugar may also be due to abnormal hormone levels or sensitivity to certain body hormones, gastric surgery, a tumor of the pancreas, and genetic disorders that interfere with the body's ability to breakdown certain food substances, such as fruit sugar. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include shakiness, hunger, lightheadedness, and sweating. People with severe hypoglycemia may pass out. Meal plan or medication changes may help treat hypoglycemia. Follow the links below to find WebMD's comprehensive coverage about how hypoglycermia occurs, what the symptoms are, how to treat it, and much more.\n\nSymptoms of type 2 Diabetes are:\nIncreased thirst\nIncreased hunger (especially after eating)\nDry mouth\nFrequent urination\nUnexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry)\nFatigue (weak, tired feeling)\nBlurred vision\nHeadaches\nLoss of consciousness (rare)\n\nI know this is a lot of information, but it gives you a place to start. Start a food journal along with your blood glucose levels. You should test:\nAs soon as you get up, 2 hours after breakfast, just before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, just before supper and 2 hours after, then just before bed. Note any additional foods/snacks you are having.\nIf your feeling the lows, make sure you carry Glucose tablets with you. When you you feel shakey, nauseous, light headed, or clammy, check your sugars (if possible) then take the recommended amount of glucose tablets on the container. If it doesn't give one, try 1 at a time and wait approximately 3-5 minutes between each one. They should work pretty quickly as they are pretty much straight glucose, but the 3-5 minutes gives your body enough time to see how your shakes go. Once the shakes go away, or you feel better, you will need to note how many Glucose tablets you took, and over what period of time it took to make you feel better.\nRemember it can take a while to get a diagnosis, there are tests and other stuff. But if you honestly think you could be diabetic, then an endocrinologist is the one to see.\n\nGood luck and God Bless.\n"},{"author":"choffman123","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"You were very helpful!","resp_content":"Reply\nnicky49\nover 2 years ago\nGlad I was able to help.

The reasons are all similar but the AAFP guidelines summarize it in plain language:\n• Insulin therapy should be initiated for patients who have random venous or plasma blood glucose (BG) concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL or whose HbA1c is > 9%.\n• In all other instances, a lifestyle modification program and metformin should be initiated as first-line therapy at the time of diagnosis of T2DM.\n• HbA1c concentrations should be monitored every 3 months and treatment intensified if treatment goals for BG and HbA1c concentrations are not being met.\n• Patients should be advised to monitor finger-stick BG concentrations if they are taking insulin or other medications with a risk of hypoglycemia, are initiating or changing their diabetes treatment regimen, have not met treatment goals, or have intercurrent illnesses.\n• Nutritional counseling may incorporate the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Pediatric Weight Management Evidence-Based Nutrition Practice Guidelines.\n\nInsulin use is now the recommended therapy for people with A1c levels of 9.0% or higher (please read that again). Correcting dietary habits, improving activity levels (a.k.a. “diet & exercise) and dropping excess body weight are also critically important but these all take time before the benefits are realized. Often, the time is something that you really can’t afford because high blood sugars are doing extreme damage to your body including the destruction of your remaining beta cells NOW. The reason why so many diabetics are complacent when it comes to high blood sugars is due to two main factors:\n1. Really bad advice from established “protocols” (that includes too many members of the medical community) that mislead diabetics into believing that high blood sugars are “OK”; that “you’re doing fine.”\n2. The damage caused by elevated blood sugars is largely asymptomatic, i.e., you don’t “feel” anything while your body is being destroyed. It can take many years before the symptoms actually surface and, by that time, it is often too late.\n\nThe BloodSugar101 website does provide information on the research that connects organ damage with blood sugar level. You can find it here:\nhttp://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045678.php\n\nGood luck. I mean that sincerely. I think you’re going to need it if you have an A1c of 16, lost your driver’s license, and apparently don’t realize that you are on the fast track to a dismal outcome. Resources for correcting your situation abound online but you’ll need to see a physician skilled in the use of insulin therapy, drastically reduce your carb intake (and get most of them from vegetables), and get serious about improving your activity levels. Pursue the measures as though your life depended on it.

I can't seem to get much help from my doctor.Thanks","resp_content":"Reply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\nannb54,\nI can't tell you, Ann. I don't have sufficient information about you to make any reasonable recommendations. Your doctor knows. But, your question is incredibly complex and his explanation would just confuse you , more, I'm afraid.\n\nIt's like asking a watch maker, \"How does a watch work?\" He knows but, he'll likely say tell you, \"For now, why don't we just to keep track of the time?\"\n\nWhat I can share are the factors that had the greatest impact on me to lower my blood sugar numbers. I look at diabetes like having an injury. In any injury, you can't rush recovery. Plus, the weaker your body is, the slower the healing takes. What do I mean by \"weaker\"?\n1. Family history\n2. Age\n3. If female, any bouts of gestational diabetes\n4. Co-morbidities (especially, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis, IBS, Gout)\n5. Prescriptions\n6. Alcohol, smoking\n7. Social interaction (Are you alone? Do you have friends, attend church, etc?)\n\nFinally, Lifestyle...the most impactful factor of all!\n1. Rest and sleep\n2. Overweight (weight loss is crucial)?\n3. Stress management (Are you emotionally on tilt, regularly? Do you lack money? Are you abused?)\n4. Exercise, daily?\n5. Diet (What percentage of your diet is \"real\"food, ie. fruit, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lean proteins?)\n\nThe more real food you eat, the better. It's just that simple.\n\nIt's taken me \"years\" to learn what buttons I need to push to calm Type 2 Diabetes. I also know, now, that each person is different. No two people share the exact same factors that determine their levels of resistance to insulin. Zero. Not even siblings!\n\nWhen you have a serious injury or are recovering from major surgery, you \"rehab\". You have to take very good care of your body, take things slow and easy, get plenty of rest, plus, make common sense decisions about exercise, diet, stress management, seeing friends and family.\n\nBut, most of all, you need to be patient. It takes time to ingrain changes to a lifestyle. Everybody wants big changes, fast. The weaker your body is, in its current state, the more time it will take to see improvements in blood sugar numbers.\n\nHow would you care for yourself if you were recovering from heart bypass surgery? I don't know you. I have no idea what \"common sense lifestyle decision making\" means to you. I know, there are a lot of people who think chips, cookies, soda and restaurant dining are perfectly OK and taking drugs and supplements are very \"sensible\". And, they believe that 10 or 20% extra weight is not a problem.\n\nFor me, my biggest lesson learned about Type 2 Diabetes?\nIt's about using \"less\" insulin, not more!\nSo, what affects hormone (like insulin) levels in the human body?\n\nFood. Plus, every bloody thing else!\n\nBlood sugar levels are simply elevated or lowered in response to rapid changes in circulating insulin levels in your body. Diabetics who fixate on \"manipulating\" blood sugar levels, in the end, realize...focusing on blood sugar has little to do with helping \"heal\" an \"injury\".\nReply\nannb54\nover 2 years ago\nIf I am understanding your reply I should eat healthier and shed some weight.Can you please tell me the best eating plan to control my blood sugar? Weight Watchers? Low Carb? or maybe something else?\nReply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\nI'm 61 yo. I do not look it. Most people think I'm in my 40's, still...\n\nThis process of \"reconstructing\" my body, restoring my health to peak \"efficiency\" has taken over a decade. This is in keeping with my original premiss: That diabetes is about uncontrolled internal inflammation due to poor lifestyle decisions, inefficiencies brought about by advancing hormonal changes and normal aging.\n\nIn other words, as we get old, your body begins to suck...at everything!\nEspecially, repairing damaged tissues though daily wear and tear. And, as that unrepaired damage accumulates, chronic, unrelenting inflammation begins to set in...the stage is now set for \"auto-immune\" conditions...diseases caused by your body's immune system attacking, itself, ie. the \"good guys\". (IBS, rheumatoid arthritis, chrohn's and colitis, diabetes, etc..)\n\nIf I were to ask you, Hey, Ann, how would you go about the process of \"rebuilding\" your entire body? What would you do? What would you eat?\nHow important does rest and recovery become? This is exactly what two aging athletes have adopted with incredible results: Tom Brady and Roger (\"The Maestro\") Federer...Their performance is not reflective of \"normal\" aging\nathletes.\n\nWhy do you suppose that is?\nDo you think their consumed with \"glucometers\" and \"food plans\"?\n\nBe patient. Use common sense. You don't play in either the NFL or the ATP, so, time is on your side. Just shoot for \"HOT\". and, your body will automatically restore normal blood sugar regulation. Don't want to look or feel, \"Hot\"?...\n\nThen keep taking drugs and measuring \"blood glucose\".\nReply\nannb54\nover 2 years ago\nThanks for your replies.It is just confusing.Do you have any books or websites that might help me get started with getting healthy and controlling my blood sugar?\nReply\njudy327\nover 2 years ago\nMay I make some suggestions? I have been pre-diabetic for many years. Last July after vacation my A1c was over 7%. My doctor was going to put me on meds but I convinced her to let me try diet and exercise. Since then I have lost 20lbs and my blood work is coming back so normal that she took me off my cholesterol medicine. I still take blood pressure meds. My A1c is about the same as yours but my daily fasting has dropped. It ranges any where from 88 to 115. Your doctor may not be concerned because of the A1c but daily highs of over 140 is not good. Type 2 diabetics get into health risks when their sugar is continuously high. So, 30 minutes of brisk walking every day 5 to 6 days a week will help not only your sugar but your blood pressure and cholesterol. You can do that outside or there are numerous walk videos to do at home. Check out websites like WebMD, the Mayo Clinic and of course The American Diabetes Association. You must be proactive when it comes to your health. Some other suggestions I can make is measuring your food for portion control and writing the info in a notebook. People just do not realize how much that helps keep you on track. I count carbohydrates because that works for me. I use measuring cups and spoons to keep my portions correct. Get rid of the cookies, cakes, pies and white bread. Those types of foods will raise your sugar almost immediately. Have them only on special occasions. Another suggestion is to test your sugar 2 hours after you take your first bite of food. 1 hour is too soon. I also read a book that I purchased at Walmart which is really helpful. It is called \"60 ways to lower your Blood Sugar\" by Dennis Pollock. I did not purchase it right away because it sounded like one of those \"get rich quick ideas\" but I was totally wrong about it. It will give you ideas on how to cut your carbs, how to eat out and recipes for making snacks and food at home. You don't have to cut out your favorite foods just have less. At first you will get hungry between meals but eventually your body does adjust. If you have a snack try to make it healthy. Apple with string cheese, or a handful of nuts, etc. I do hope I was able to help out a little. Good Luck.\nReply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\njudy327,\n\nThank you for your voice! Finally, another voice that has my back. Plus, you're so much kinder and gentler than me. Yippee kay-yay!\n\nIf overweight, weight loss is crucial in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nEverybody knows that...\n\nWeight loss is 80% food. &, of that 80%, 50% is sugar. And where does the sugar come from? Processed food. Sugar and salt inundates processed food. This is why losing weight is next to impossible in this country. Because, (1.) Salty and sweet is so addictive, and (2.) If you remove process foods from the diet, you have to either...\nA. Eat raw, whole foods\nB. Cook the majority of your meals\nC. Stop eating at restaurants (at least the most affordable ones)\n\nAsk a 20 or 30 something, \"What are the chances of you quitting all \"processed food\"? Zippo. No chance.\n\nThis generation and the one after that has no chance, imo. They will have Type 2 Diabetes up the ying yang. And, it's all because my generation, the Baby Boomers, decided it was OK to ignore their momma's golden rule...\n\"Eat your fruits and vegetables (or you can't leave the table)\".\n\nPS: Exercise is critical for good health but it has little to do with weight loss, imo.\nExercise makes your thirsty and water is crucial for weight loss and Type 2 Diabetes!\nExercise helps us sleep and sleep is crucial for weight loss and Type 2 Diabetes. Exercise helps us stay young by building muscles and balancing hormone levels...and, that my friends, is a huge key to maintaining our health.\n\nSo, do I think \"exercise\" is critical for treating diabetes? Nahhhhhhhhhhhhh...not at all!\nReply\njudy327\nover 2 years ago\nExercise perhaps is not critical for diabetes but in general it helps a persons all around health. I have seen many skinny diabetics. I do agree that food is probably the most crucial when trying to control diabetes. I never worry about the calories I just concentrate on the carbs and portions. The calories drop on their own.\nReply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\nI focus on fiber, judy. There is so little known about the exact role of fiber in the diet. I just believe it is essential for proper gut maintenance and inflammatory control. Also, foods high in fiber are packed with water. I eat lots of fruit because I can eat it raw and it's incredibly fibrous. As I've expanded my knowledge on T2 Diabetes, I believe, much of what's discussed on boards like this is simply the result of information \"manipulation\". For example, you don't eat fruit because it has too much sugar.\n\nThe primary differences between fruit and processed \"carbs\".\nWater...Fiber...Sugar Concentration\n\nFinally, I will share an excerpt about Dr. Elliot P. Joslin, the father of Modern Diabetes Medicine (1869-1962)...\n\n\"...Three horses draw the diabetic chariot and their names are \"diet, exercise and insulin\". In fact, all of us in our life’s journey depend on the three, but seldom recognize the third although we often realize we are poor charioteers. Yet we fortunate ones have instinct to help us hold the reins, but the diabetic cannot trust his instincts as a guide, and in place of it must depend upon dieticians, nurses and doctors unless he understands his disease...\"\n\n\n\n\"...UNLESS HE UNDERSTANDS HIS DISEASE.\" Bingo!\n\nLife is so much different in 1869, 1962 and today. The only reason why people think I'm \"mean\" or \"hateful\"? It's because they think they know their disease. But, haven't spent the time to study themselves.\n\nIf you want to catch a mafia boss, all you have to do is follow the money.\nIf you want to take true control of your Type 2 Diabetes, all you have to do is follow your \"symptoms\". High blood sugar is a \"symptom\", so, OK...sure...follow it to learn which way your diabetes is \"headed\".\n\nBut, people have been measuring \"blood glucose levels\" for over a hundred years, now.\n\nAnd, it's believed that 1 in 3 adults, today, are either prediabetic or diabetic.\n\nSo, tell me. What has \"manipulating\" your blood glucose levels gotten \"you\"? Are the vast majority getting better? Or, worse?\n\nFinally, Judy, common sense told you that weight loss restores normal blood sugar regulation, time and time, again. Joslin saw this through his studies on intermittent fasting. Today, we see this through gastric bypass surgery. wth, do you think is happening and why does it work in T2 D?\n\nI'll tell you why! Joslin's third gd horse is why! INSULIN!\nReply\nbrunosbud\nover 2 years ago\nPS, judy. I also agree about eating less. I've never measured food quantities because much of my diet is raw. Wash it, eat it.\n\nNo one in the history of human history has gotten fat or type 2 diabetes eating raw foods...wash it, eat it.\n\nWhen you experiment with eating less food and allow your body to tell you what's filling and satiating, you will discover something quite astonishing:\nYour whole life; you were consuming just insane amounts of food!\n\nEverybody talks about \"blood sugar levels\" but always fails to disclose just how much food they were eating. Like it has nothing to do with their condition! Eat less and you won't be, here, asking questions anymore. Period.\nReply\njudy327\nover 2 years ago\nPersonally I don't think your comments are mean or hateful, just honest and frank. People need a wake-up call. I did. For years doctors told me to \"watch your sugar\". They never did explain what exactly that meant. One less piece of cake, one less candy bar? It wasn't until my current doctor had me testing every day that I suddenly woke up. For the first 2 weeks I cut out sugar and tested but nothing changed. That's when I started on this continuous journey of finding out everything I could about the disease and what I could do to change my habits. I hear you when you say diabetics focus on \"manipulating\" blood sugar levels. I have read stories of people who will take extra insulin in order to pig out at a party. So maybe the numbers are great but all that extra insulin floating around in the bloodstream is not healthy. I think for Type 2 diabetics the ideal would be to do everything you can to avoid the meds or get off the meds if possible. It definitely requires a lifestyle change that most people are not ready to make.\n"},{"author":"CSTAR11","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Fasting Blood Sugar","resp_content":"Trending higher blood sugar readings would indicate you are becoming more insulin resistant.

How long do you think that party will last?\n\nI don't need to check my blood sugar, anymore, because I know it is impossible to run high blood sugar without my body exhibiting other inflammatory \"signals\", concurrently.

Tooth decay, ditto. Since I reversed my T2 D, I have not lost a single tooth. For me, digestive issues and poor bowel movements are just as indicative of high blood sugar as a glucometer.\n\nIf you address chronic inflammation, you will find the \"control\" you seek, sanjeev. It will be reflective in your blood sugar reading...and, your mirror, too.

Fifteen percent to 20% of these people were able to stop taking their diabetes medications.\"\n\n\n\nWhy does Type 2 diabetes reversal work for some and not others?\n\nThe answer is simple: Type 2 Diabetes is not caused by too much blood sugar.\nIt is caused by too much insulin. Have you not heard the phrase, \"Insulin Resistance\" instead of diabetes?\n\nWhat happens when a heroin addict uses too much heroin? He builds a \"heroin resistance\".\nWhat happens when an alcoholic drinks too much? He builds a \"alcohol resistance\".\nIn other words, by using too much of any drug over prolonged periods of time, your body becomes less and less sensitive to its affects, thereby, requiring increasing amounts to accomplish the desired affect...to get high, to get loaded...or, to clear your blood stream of too much glucose.\n\n\nSo, tell me. Why is it, all Type 2 Diabetics try to reduce Blood Sugar when the problem with their body is, they've built a \"resistance (or insensitivity) to insulin\" ?\n\nThe argument, of course, is: Well, what's the big deal? What's the difference between high blood sugar and high insulin?\n\nA huge difference!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIf too much insulin is the true root cause of T2 D, then why in the world is everybody taking drugs that RAISE insulin levels (to treat this disease).\n\nAfter reading this, you probably are not convinced. You will go on taking meds and trying to reduce blood sugar just like everybody with diabetes.\n\nJust answer me this, then? Why is it, all the diabetes drug takers keep having to dose more drugs, yet, their diabetes continues to \"progress\" over time? How come it never gets better, only, worse?\n\nAnswer: Because they never ask their doctor the following question: \"If my problem is \"insulin resistance\", shouldn't I be trying to use less insulin, not more?...Can you explain it to me like I'm a five year old, please?\"\n\nAfter 10 years participation on this board, not one person has ever come forward and explained how lowering blood sugar reduces insulin resistance.\nZERO. Not even a physician!\n\nPeople are reversing Type 2 Diabetes, all the time, through proper diet, exercise and proper weight loss (low carb, high fat, intermittent fasting). It is impossible to reverse this disease by increasing insulin use/production. You can throw all the drugs you want at T2D; it will fail, regardless. At the end of the day, nobody can eat processed foods, long term, and get away with it. Nobody!\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/23706/hyperglycemia"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Fainting","post_content":"I am a 72 year old mail who cycling 2500 to 3000 miles a year, at 5/10 I weight 190.

There are medications that can help with the burning pain, aka diabetic neuropathy. Many people who keep their glucose levels in the normal range consistently do have a reduction of those symptoms.\n\nWhat exactly are you thinking is the \"normal\" range? An HBA1C result of less than 6.0% would be normal. Between 6.0 and 7.0 are considered \"controlled\" but still may cause complications like neuropathy.

You are right - all carbohydrates do convert to glucose and is stored as fat in our bodies. You do not need a doctor to help you reverse your diabetes. Start now by changing your lifestyle. If you smoke, quit. If you drink too much alcohol, stop. Get more exercise. Eat the right foods - lean proteins, lean dairy, vegetables and a small amount of a whole grain carbohydrate. You will need to experiment to see what types of carbohydrates to limit and which ones to eliminate. Personally, any type of rice will cause my blood glucose reading to rise, while white potatoes in small quantities are fine for me. Do not eat processed foods, especially those containing high fructose corn syrup. Never drink fruit juice, eat the whole fruit since they contain more fiber.\n\nYou may want to see a certified diabetes educator, a dietician or a nutritionist for help in understanding how to eat a health diet.

In other words, every parent knows, a single reading is useless. It's the \"trend\" (of several readings) that matters.\n\nbut, the trend of Type 2 Diabetes is entirely dependent on one person and one person, alone. Every person is dependent on making common sense decisions in the best interests of their own safety. Doctors have little control over what a person's sugar \"trend\" will follow because they don't fill your mom's fork. They don't tie your mom's exercise tennies.

Here's a list of a few diseases linked to \"insulin resistance\"...\n\nObesity\nHigh Blood Pressure\nHigh Cholesterol\nHeart Disease\nCancer\n\nYou don't give any details so I can't/won't comment on your particular situation...no age, no family history, no comorbidities, weight, smoking, alcohol, diet, etc...You do say, you ignored the changes recommended to you by your doctors...that says much, but, here's the bottomline.\n\nYou're either genius or you don't know a thing about Type 2 Diabetes. Either way, just because a person doesn't shows no signs of high blood sugar, don't mean jack. You can be diagnosed with prediabetes (metabolic syndrome) and still pass fasting blood glucose test, so without any specific \"details\", no body in the world can argue your claims of cure, but at the same time, no one can congratulate you, either. Since, your doctor(s) have all that information, the only opinion that matters, really, is their's.\n\n\nRegardless, I have successfully \"reversed\" my initial prediabetes diagnosis. That was 10 years, ago. Here's a list of what insulin resistance (and alcoholism) did to my body (besides high blood sugars):\n1. High Blood Pressure\n2. High Triglycerides\n3. Allergies\n4. Sleep Apnea\n5. Insomnia\n6. Wheezing night coughing\n7. Acne\n8. Impaired night vision\n9. Lost half my teeth\n10.Lost half my hair\n11.Almost lost my wife (and, my dogs)\n12.Frequent, colds, headaches, flu\n13.Gastric Reflux\n14.Muscle cramps\n15.Bad breath and body odor\n16.Dandruff\n17.Road Rage\n\nI am 61, male, family of 4, semi-retired, bad golfer, plant based, fresh, whole food diet, walk 6 miles, min, everyday, take no meds, suffer zero medical issues. and, I wear dentures...\n\nWhat I learned about Type 2 Diabetes over these last 10 years?\n1. It is reversible (\"curable\")\n2. Diabetes is, without question, a medical condition that affects people differently, and\n3. Type 2 Diabetes is not the problem that people face on this board. Chronic inflammation resulting in the development and progression of \"insulin resistance\" is the real deal. Everybody in this country has developing insulin resistance (including myself) therefore everyone is on the T2D \"spectrum\". EVERYONE! Finally, insulin resistance can only be reversed through reduced inflammatory lifestyle changes (&, you don't get pregnant by \"accident\", either...).\n\nWhen you metabolically rehabilitate your body through reducing insulin resistance, you can't possibly imagine just how fkdup your body was, before the journey. The work you put in, you get it all back. And, more. The transformation and rejuvenation your body undergoes is a transcendent experience, imo. Normal blood sugar control is just the tip of the iceberg.\nNot only, has all the, above, \"symptoms\" disappeared, not only have I thrown away all my old glucometers, I don't need/wear my driving glasses, anymore.\n\nThink about that one...\n1\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/19113/diabetes"},{"post":{"author":"timcmi","post_time":"over 2 years ago","post_title":"Diarrhea after stopping Metformin with T2D","post_content":"I was diagnosed with T2D in May have been taking Metformin and Glicazide since then.

However, I noticed that right before I started to feel this way I became particularly afraid of developing diabetes. It started off with slight numbness in my feet. At first I assumed it was only a placebo effect causing the sudden numbness. And then the numbness disappeared and it turned into a weird feeling in my calf, not a pins and needles sensation but just a strange feeling. Shortly after, I noticed that I started to feel generally unwell, like I had a bad cold. I noticed that I would get chills at random times. However, right before all of these symptoms started I just felt generally less hungry and I wasn't eating much, maybe about one meal a day. At first I assumed that perhaps it was caused by me not eating much.\n\nThen I noticed that I felt an increased need to urinate. I found that I felt the increased need the most when I was worrying about diabetes. However whenever I urinated only a little would come out and it usually had a strong scent of ammonia. Also I'll occasionally get these weird on and off feelings of being very drowsy. I noticed they usually occurred around 9 pm until usually midnight. I found it strange that eating usually made the fatigue go away temporarily. I would assume that eating would usually make it worst so this adds onto my doubts. The weird leg sensation has also been on and off as well and it usually goes away temporarily while I'm being physically active. If I now think about it, this illness has been kinda on and off. One minute I'll feel almost completely healthy then next minute I feel as if I didn't sleep at all the previous night. Also, I checked my weight and I haven't gain nor lost any at all. Also I've been feeling feverish so I assume it might be an infection that mimics the symptoms of diabetes. I've been feeling this way for about 4 days now. Right before this I felt perfectly healthy.\n\nI'm from a low income family so I kinda grew up eating crap and I still kinda do. I also usually do ingest a large amount of sugar and I have a family history of diabetes so I know I'm at a pretty high risk.

Before that I was a patient at a local pain clinic where my addiction was started and was there forabout 6 1/2 yrs. It is along time to be on methadone. Almost 2 weeks ago my husband was in a car accident which left him with 2 breaks in his wrist. Unfortunately this has put him out of work which means we cannot afford to continue to go to the clinic. Starting Monday we both will start being financially detoxed which means that we will decrease our doses at a rate of 5 milligrams a day.

Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed.\nMONITOR YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL. You might need to check and record your blood sugar level at least three to four times a day — more often if you're ill or under stress. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure your blood sugar level remains within your target range.\nADJUST YOUR INSULIN DOSAGE AS NEEDED. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to adjust your insulin dosage in relation to your blood sugar level, what you eat, how active you are, whether you're ill and other factors. If your blood sugar level begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to return your blood sugar level to your target range.\nCHECK YOUR KETONE LEVEL. When you're ill or under stress, test your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter urine ketones test kit (e.g., “Ketostix”). If your ketone level is moderate or high, contact your doctor right away BEFORE you need emergency care. If you have low levels of ketones, you may need to take more insulin.\nBE PREPARED TO ACT QUICKLY. If you suspect that you have diabetic ketoacidosis — your blood sugar level is high, and you have excess ketones in your urine — seek emergency care.\"\n\nFrom the UK site: “Brittle diabetes is often associated with gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) because it can affect the rate at which food, glucose and insulin is absorbed into the bloodstream. It is also frequently associated with psychological issues such as stress and depression.”\n\nThe emotional factors in the equation are what makes me hesitant in responding to your post. I sense an urgent request for help or comments. But I also detect a sense of self-denial or reluctance to actively embrace the things that are so essential, so vital, to correcting the serious imbalances you have described. The reason your healthcare providers labelled your situation as “diabetes mismanagement” is due to the fact your problems can usually be headed off at the pass BEFORE they reach a crisis stage.\n\nI am NOT passing judgement or being overly critical. My only intent is to make you aware that you might have to just take several steps back and objectively evaluate what you’re doing or perhaps, NOT doing (but should be). If you are seriously interested in getting some helpful suggestions from the members on this message board, please post back. There are still some folks here who have the equivalent of many decades of experience and our blood susgars are reasonably well controlled. Between us, we can provide you with plenty of suggestions that may enable you to join us in living virtually normal lives alongside this chronic disease.\n\nWell, the ball is \"in your court.\" Only YOU can make the necessary decisions to learn all that you can in order to literally conquer/tame this disease. I have mentioned Dr. Richard K. Bernstein numerous times in my other posts. He is a type 1 diabetic who suffered severe diabetes-related complications and in his mid-30s, faced a very grim and uncertain future. He is credited with being the first person to adopt the concept of self-testing and self-monitoring of blood sugar levels as a tool to improving his roller-coaster blood sugars. Nearly fifty years later, he remains a thriving diabetic virtually free of all of the devastating complications he had when he was in his 30s. He recently celebrated his 83rd birthday last month.

This gives your body the time it needs to absorb the medicine.\n\nThere’s lots of variation in the time that it takes to digest food, and different parts of the stomach and intestine function on their own time.

Yet, the components/parts of your meal matter to how food travels through this complicated organ system. For example , liquids travel more rapidly and are absorbed quicker than proteins.\n\nIf you're concerned that diabetes has affected your stomach's digestive process, I'd say talk to your doctor .

By testing the percentage of A1c in someone’s blood, doctors can tell how well a patient has tolerated and processed glucose over the past few months. The results are then compared to the percentages on an A1c chart. Changes in the A1c measurements over time can be used to determine how well the patient has managed his/her diabetes. It can also be used to gauge the progress of diabetes if a PWD's A1c continues to rise.\n\nA finger-stick test is only a snapshot in time. In Dr. Bernstein's webcast this evening, he mentioned that some people can have near-normal tests virtually all of the time and still have A1c's in the 5.2 to 5.4 range. However, your A1c measurement of 7.2 suggests that you are spiking much higher than the \"normal\" range, especially if \"every morning I was under 120 most of the time.\" That begs the question: what was your blood sugar reading at bedtime?\n\nIf it was high but your pancreas was able to work overtime while you slept (to finally bring it down under 120 because you weren't eating), then that's just one factor in your 7.2 A1c. Your readings 2 hours post-meal, if high, would readily contribute to your 7.2 result because the A1c is an AVERAGE of all your glycated hemoglobin during periods when your blood sugar levels are both high and low. Your meter could be providing information based on whole blood glucose instead of the more contemporary plasma blood glucose.\n\nAnd, or course, some meters are simply not very good. We call them RNG's which stand for \"random number generators.\" I won't mention brand names but users in the DOC (Diabetes Online Community) have often posted terrible and very inconsistent results with some meter brands; even when making multiple tests with different tests strips using the SAME DROP of blood. You might try asking your doctor for a new meter. The most accurate ones that I have tested are the Freestyle one with the Accu-Check brand coming in a close second. The newer Contour Next One meter also appears to be reasonably accurate. If your doctor doesn't have these brands on hand, visit the manufacturer's website. You can usually get a free coupon for the meter if your doctor will write a Rx for the strips. Of course, a more accurate meter may only shock you into realizing that your blood sugars have been running much higher than you thought.

It seems like you’ve changed somewhat since the original forum days. You seem to be too focused solely on self-awareness and lifestyle changes to battle (or “fight”) the insidious nature of the family of diseases that we call diabetes. I don’t mean to be critical of you personally but do think that there is a need for balance. These message boards do not seem to draw a large enough audience to see a sufficient number of divergent posts and opinions so I’ll weigh in with mine.","resp_content":"\nThe reason why most people with diabetes (PWDs) and healthcare providers are “so fixated on blood sugar...blood sugar readings...a1c...yada, yada, yada” is because elevated blood sugars cause a great deal of damage to the human body. Most of us already know that high blood sugars damage (glycosylate) the proteins of virtually every cell that it comes into contact with. That’s how and why PWDs get “complications” such as neuropathy (nerve damage), retinopathy (retinal or eye damage), nephropathy (kidney damage), atherosclerosis (blood vessel and heart damage), and a whole lot more. That even includes brain cells so it would be factual to state that the longer you let high blood sugars run amok, the dumber you’re going to get (pun intended).\n\nJenny Ruhl, the author of the BloodSugar101 book and proprietor of the website with the same name, provided an excellent summary of why lowering blood sugars must be priority one. Her article, entitled “Research Connecting Organ Damage With Blood Sugar Level”, doesn’t leave much room for doubt because she includes full references to all of the studies and reports that support her statements. So, yes, it definitely needs to be “fixated” on:\nhttp://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045678.php\n\nThat does not mean that lifestyle changes should not be implemented concurrently with whatever measures are needed to lower blood glucose (BG) levels. However, to stop the damage, one does have to focus or fixate on getting their sugars down. Why? Because as beneficial as lifestyle changes are (weight loss, eating real food instead of toxic “food products”, exercise/activity, etc.), all of them TAKE TIME to exert their beneficial effects. You can’t lose weight overnight and switching to a healthier diet and ramping up your activity levels will not provide quick results … it takes time. But if your body is already undergoing gradual and relentless damage, it is essential to stop the damage and to stop it now!\n\nThat’s why the Joselyn Diabetes Clinic now advocates starting Type 2 diabetics on insulin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Why? To bring down BG levels and STOP THE DAMAGE! Now! ASAP! At the same time, their diabetes specialists DO start to implement all of the things that you (me too) favor such as improvement or overhauls in eating habits (I dislike the term, diet), significant changes in overall lifestyle, incorporating customized plans of exercise/activity, healthy weight loss, etc. etc. Then, as benefits from all of the supporting lifestyle modifications take effect, the patients are gradually weaned off the insulin (unless, of course, they turn out to be insulin deficient). Some patients, after achieving significant weight loss, can become medication free; others may be switched from insulin to oral meds. To reinforce this critical point about stopping organ damage, reviewing Jenny Ruhl’s article a second time might be useful.\n\nJust FYI, I just passed my 76th birthday last month. At that age, I am still virtually medication free except for insulin and an asthma (steroid-free) rescue inhaler. I am not and have never been a burden to the healthcare system because the cost of my insurance premiums over the years greatly exceeds what nominal amounts that I draw from it. In other words, I pay more money INTO the system than the cost of medical services that I draw from it and surprise, surprise, that even includes my Medicare premiums. Medicare costs me more money than the nominal benefits that I draw from it. I even pay for my own annual comprehensive blood test panel and only see my endocrinologist twice a year (to renew my insulin and BG test strips Rx’s). I haven’t had a cold or a flu in over forty years and the only flu shot that I ever had was in 1999 when my Mom’s visiting nurse stopped by to give her a shot and insisted that I get one also.\n\nI generally refuse to eat processed foods which I do not consider to be “food” at all but “food products”. I scratch-cook most of my own meals, shop the produce section most frequently, do include some animal products such as seafood (wild caught only), poultry, lamb, eggs and a variety of cheeses. I avoid processed vegetable oils and rely almost exclusively on unprocessed coconut oil, avocado oil, and extra virgin olive oil. I do not eat GMOs or grains but do still consume waffles and pancakes that I make myself using a blend of coconut flour, oat bran, almond flour with lots of eggs. I went to the pharmacy yesterday to pick up my BG strips and finally consented to getting a pneumonia vaccine; the pharmacist couldn’t believe that I was as old as my calendar age. That should give you an idea that when it comes to caring for one’s own health, we are both on the same page. Where we differ is that I do not feel that healthy lifestyle alone (to improve diabetes) is something that can be applied to everyone as you seem so focused on doing. Age, gender, genetics, infirmities, other health issues, can all interfere. Perhaps you might find it beneficial to give your soap box a rest.

How many diets? How are those drugs your doctor's prescribed for your diabetes; How's that working for you?\n\nHere's my suggestion that I know will work: Fasting\n\nWhy does it work? Because, when you stop eating, your blood sugar levels not only decrease, your INSULIN levels decrease, too. So, why is that such a big deal? Because, insulin is the \"Fat Storage Hormone\". Insulin clears the bloodstream of blood sugar and places it in the liver (glycogen) and any excess glucose, in lipid cells as fat.\n\nThe reason why bariatric surgery reverses Type 2 Diabetes well BEFORE you actually lose all the weight (in some cases, days after surgery)? You're not eating, anymore! You stomach has been stapled shut to the size of a walnut! Far less insulin is being produced and now your body can deplete glycogen stores in the liver and, then, go after the stored fat. Once excess bodyfat begins to be used as energy (in lieu, of food), blood sugar levels begin to stabilize almost immediately.\n\nIs fasting bad for you? Google it; Don't make me do all the work for you! Do you lose muscle when you fast? No. Does your metabolism slow during fasting? Not unless you decide to sleep in a cave for the next three months, no food. Is fasting expensive? Only for morons, it is. Are there rules for fasting? None that I know of?\n\nShould I fast without telling my doctor?

Then, that would mean, that they're symptoms would worsen over time despite making every effort (thru diet, exercise, stress management, etc) to keep them at bay.

(Type 1 Diabetics MUST receive injectable insulin because they cannot produce sufficient amounts of insulin.\n\nDear Dr. Nazario,\n\nWhy are so many diabetes specialists, physicians, and clinical researchers claiming that the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, for the last 50 years, was not only \"ineffective\", but, in fact, the majority of the diabetes medications prescribed to patients, today, actually makes the disease \"progress\" and cause the patient to become MORE insulin resistant (and gain weight!)?\n\nA growing sentiment among diabetes specialists and endocrinologists suggests the proper treatment for Type 2 Diabetes is expose the patient to LESS insulin, not more. Insulin, aka, the \"fat storage hormone\", so, the use of diabetes medications that either directly or indirectly increase the patient's insulin production (or, direct insulin injections) makes it difficult for a patient to lose fat. It is hypothesized that excessive fat surrounding vital organs (pancreas, heart and liver) may be the cause of elevated blood glucose levels characteristic of Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nIf ongoing research confirms that less insulin is the right \"treatment\" of T2D, then, is it possible that physicians (and pharmaceutical companies) that continue to prescribe drugs that raise insulin levels could be accused of medical malpractice?

Damage to nerve tissue. This is why gangrene happens most to fingers and toes. Diabetes causes neuropathy, typically, to lower extremities, fingers and toes.\n2. High blood sugar damages blood vessels and limits blood circulation to injured/infected areas. Without blood flow, healing of injuries becomes slow and difficult.\n3.

Hopefully, by the end of this discussion, you'll refrain from asking \"what should I eat\" questions, forever.\n\nFirst, please read the following,\n\"Diabetes and Inflammation\"\nhttp://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/inflammation-and-diabetes#1\n(I care not whether you believe what I say but once you read it, you will realize, I'm not pulling this stuff out of my *** and making it up as I go...)\n\nSo, now that you know there is a relationship between high blood sugar and the body's inflammatory response (agro immune system>>white blood cells sent>>release of \"cytokines\">>> yada, yada, yada...), there you go! Chemicals released from bloody fat cells causes inflammation>>>>blood sugar soars. Who knew?!?! So, brown rice causes inflammation (indirectly)! Hot-diggety-dog! Problem solved! I'm a genius!...\n\nBut, hold on...Not so fast.\n\nThere are many \"things\" that can illicit an inflammatory response besides pancakes, french fries, spaghetti, snickerdoodles and BROWN RICE (no matter how much you EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!).\n\nAgain, INFLAMMATION: occurs when chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues. It's designed to \"protect your body\" from \"foreign substances\" (ie. crap released from fat cells). These chemicals (cytokines) increase the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. So, in other words, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of fat cells because it can cause \"inflammation\" and, as a result, raise my blood sugar. BOO-HOO.\n\nOK, so being fat is not good. So, I'll lose some weight. That's why my doctor keeps badgering me. Now, it makes sense...\n\nJust one problem: To reiterate, there are many things (hundreds!!!!!!!!) that can/may cause short term or chronic inflammation. Here's a 1 minute sampling...\n\nbee stings\nyelling at your spouse or child\n(You spouse yelling at you,\nYou yelling at the driver in front of you,\nYou flipping the driver as you drive by,...)\nbruising your shin on the coffee table\nmedications your doctor prescribed to you (birth control, decongestants, vitamin B, steroids, barbiturates, etc, etc, etc)\nany drug you heard from a friend of a friend that lost 30 lbs in 30 days!\narthritis\nIBS\nHigh cholesterol\nHigh blood pressure\nauto-immune diseases\nmenstrual cramps\ntooth aches\ncolds and flus\npollen\npeanut butter\nhousehold cleaning products\ncosmetics\nridiculous, untested \"supplements\" you saw on Dr. _z or Dr. Ph_l or Dr. Who\ntooth aches\nmenopause\npoison oak\nflu shots\nantibiotics\nblood pressure meds\ncholesterol meds\nand, of course, \"brown rice\"\n\nSo, how in the world, would anybody (& their grandmother) know the cause of YOUR \"inflammation\" that resulted in your A1C going up? Sure, it could be all that brown sugar you ate. But, it could also be 10,000 other things!!!!! And, because you \"shared\" so much detailed medical information about yourself and family history, we have all the data needed to reach a definite, lock down, air tight conclusion...Yup. Has to be the \"brown rice\"!\n\n\n\nI don't mean to make light of your question...\n\nThe truth is: Each individual has a unique, one-of-a-kind, metabolic make-up and what is likely the cause of their uncontrolled blood sugar regulation is not one factor (brown rice) but the combination & strength of HUNDREDS of FACTORS (age, diet, weight, race, family history, environmental conditions, stress, co-morbidities, medications, social network, etc, etc). But, because you don't understand how complex Type 2 Diabetes is (much less how inflammation affects blood sugar) the only thing you \"fear\" is food...\n\n...like, brown rice.

Over time, this vicious cycle can lead to persistently elevated blood glucose levels, or type 2 diabetes...\"\n\n\"...the level of glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain is always about 60% as high as the level of glucose in your bloodstream—even if you have insulin resistance—so, the higher your blood sugar, the higher your brain sugar...\"\n\n\"...While most brain cells don’t require insulin in order to absorb glucose, they do require insulin in order to process glucose. Cells must have access to adequate insulin or they can’t transform glucose into the vital cellular components and energy they need to thrive. Despite swimming in a sea of glucose, brain cells in people with insulin resistance literally begin starving to death...\"\n\n\"...Which brain cells go first? The hippocampus is the brain's memory center. Hippocampal cells require so much energy to do their important work that they often need extra boosts of glucose. While insulin is not required to let a normal amount of glucose into the hippocampus, these special glucose surges do require insulin, making the hippocampus particularly sensitive to insulin deficits. This explains why declining memory is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s, despite the fact that Alzheimer’s Disease eventually destroys the whole brain...\"\n\n\nInflammation is a direct cause of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a direct cause of Type 2 Diabetes. And, now, they've connected the dots between Alzheimer's and insulin resistance. The test for insulin resistance is the measurement of fasting blood glucose, A1C and insulin levels.\nInsulin resistance is treated by \"lifestyle modifications\" and in some (most) cases, \"medications\".\n\nIf the treatment of insulin resistance is through \"LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS\", and, it has been ridiculously well established, now, how utterly vital it is to NOT TO BE INSULIN RESISTANT... then, why be vague about the treatment of INSULIN RESISTANCE? Why doesn't the medical profession spell it out for everyone, when your doctor talks about \"Lifestyle Modifications\"? Don't you think it's a wee bit odd, every single post, here, ends with the question, \"Should I be worried...?\" They are worried because they are CLUELESS. They are worried because they have no idea how to properly treat Type 2 Diabetes (aka, insulin resistance)...\n\nThe truth is, nobody knows what \"insulin resistance\" is because nobody cares! But, when your lower legs and feet feel like they're on \"fire\", when you start to lose sight in an eye and, worst but not least, when you accuse your spouse of hiding your car keys or glasses, that's the time we should learn about \"insulin resistance\"?\n\nObamacare or Trumpcare; what difference does it make? No insurance can possibly \"cover\" what insulin resistance does to the human body. Not one word in any medical insurance coverage addresses the prevention of \"insulin resistance\". And, the treatment of insulin resistance, now, represents 8% of our entire Gross National Product! Gee, if we could understand what \"lifestyle modifications\" meant, what could we do with almost a trillion dollars?\n\nIf any disease \"progresses\", that means it getting WORSE. If you're doctor is having to increase the dosage of drugs, prescribed, that means it's getting worse. Of course, it's every patient's \"fault\" their disease is \"worsening\". They're the ones not following \"instructions\". They're the ones, not losing weight! We are know, patients are \"weak\" and without \"discipline\"...\n\nSo, why be vague? If the treatment for insulin resistance is \"Lifestyle Modifications\", why not spell it out like we're 5 year olds? Why must people be \"worried\" about Type 2 Diabetes?\n\nAnswer: Because. Nobody cares enough (to demand the madness stop).\nOn your next doctor appointment, tell your doctor, \"I don't want to be Type 2 Diabetic, anymore. Tell me what I need to do to \"reverse\" my diabetes.\"\n\nJust do it!","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/8515/insulin-resistance-and-alzheimer-s"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Blood Sugars","post_content":"Why is my blood sugar higher in the morning and lower in the late afternoon.

Your random test was out of range, and a controlled OGTT will give an indication of how badly you go out of range in the presence of a lot of carbohydrate.

Without good digestion, food tends to stay in the lower G.I. tract for too long a period. Most people who suffer constipation are quite familiar with painful cramps and tiny, compacted \"rocks\" for turds. Food that hang around too long in the \"system\" tend to fester and spoil. It is this spoiling of food that results in \"inflammation\".\n\nNow, any inflammation combined with diabetes is a lose-lose scenario. Not only does inflammation cause blood sugar to rise, in the case of constipation, I've seen this phenomenon in two separate incidences: Painful swelling of the joints in the hands and feet.\n\nThis is why I've said a 1000 times, here: You have to move! Once you stop moving and stay active, you lose a huge weapon in the fight against inflammation. Normal bowel movements* are a function of an active life.

Gravity is required to continually push digested waste down through the colon.\n\nLaxatives and stool softeners are two of the most abused OTC drugs, today.

You know why this is? I'll bet the drug companies have something to do with it...\n\nTotal Cholesterol: Recently, cardiologists are now recommending everyone's level should be below 200 at all ages, but, in reality, it's a moving target range...\n= Upper level is 230 + age, Max 300\n= Lower level is 115 + age\n\nTriglycerides:\n= Males upper level is 130 + age, Max 200\n= Females lower level is 80 + age, Max 165\n= Males/Females lower level is your age\n\nLDL: Normal range = 60-150 below age 20\n= 70-180 age 30-50\n= 80-210 above age 50\n\nAny discussion on an individual's \"cholesterol\" is incomplete without some discussion on Hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism causes abnormal lipid metabolism which results in accelerated cardiovascular disease. The standard and most widely accepted measure for hypothyroidism is: \"TSH\" (thyroid-stimulating hormone). The official TSH \"normal range\" is 0.5 to 5.0.\n\nOn that range, a TSH under 0.5 (a low TSH) indicated hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), and a TSH over 5.0 (a high TSH) indicated hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid.)\n\nDiabetes combined with Hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0) is not a safe place to be.\n\nAlso, do your gums bleed when you brush your teeth even though you don't have a blood coagulation disorder? If they do, you likely have either have periodontal disease or Vitamin C deficiency or both. Either condition predisposes you to cardiovascular disease. Platelet count can identify bleeding disorders and slow clotting issues. Frequent presence of blood on your toothbrush is a bad \"sign\" and should not go ignored.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to identify basic health and diabetes/coronary issues is the \"WAIST Test\". Your waist measure should not exceed 1/2 your height in inches. I'm 5'10\" tall so my height is 70 inches. Therefore, to pass the WAIST Test, my waist measure should not exceed 35 inches. Insurance companies are good at making money because their actuaries are very knowledgeable in determining risks. Why do you think they insist on knowing your \"height\" and \"waist\" measurements as part of your insurance physical? Failing the WAIST Test is a strong indicator of pre-diabetes/diabetes and, consequently, a useful indicator of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThis is why, if you are independently paying for either life or health insurance and you, now, pass the WAIST test whereas, previously, you did not, ask your insurer if you may qualify for a lower rate.

If sleep suffers - so will your readings. If your sedentary- that affects it as well. Even stress in your life - out of the normal levels will affect your readings! Foods - if you've not been guided -- the Non-starchy veggies are highly encouraged, with some quality protein sources at each meal or snack. The white potatoes, corn, peas, type veggies - as well as obvious grains like pastas, rices, etc - should be in moderate portions because they too will spike your readings. Fruits are something to keep in moderation -- berries & apples seems to be the best in not spiking BG levels because of the fiber & water content.

Dr. Goodyear, who helped design the facility, is primarily a lab scientist who focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of exercise. She’s found that when muscles contract, signals become activated, leading to glucose being cleared from the blood and into the muscles.\n\nNew research also suggests that contracting muscles secrete proteins into the circulation that improve glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and lipid levels.\n\nAnother question: Can fat tissue be made healthier? “When we transplanted subcutaneous fat tissue from exercise-trained mice into untrained mice, the ‘trained’ fat imparted the benefits of exercise to the untrained mice, working to prevent the harmful effects of a high-fat diet,” she says. “This suggests the trained fat is secreting something beneficial. These findings indicate a signal from fat regulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle”...\n\nJoslin research is continuing to amass irrefutable evidence that exercise reverses insulin resistance.

Sometimes the seas are calm. Sometimes the seas are fierce & violent. You may think diabetes is caused by blood sugar. It's not! Not even close! The blood sugar readings are simply reflective of ongoing turmoil (inflammation) in other parts of the body (ie. Bowels; where 3/4 of the body's immune system is located). Like, how an offshore earthquake, 1000 miles away, can generate a tidal surge so strong it can remove entire cities in it's wake. Right now, you are experiencing a tsunami, my friend.\n\nIf you haven't seen a doctor in the last week or, at minimum, reported your readings to your physician about these elevated readings, I strongly suggest you do so, now.\n\nWhat can cause major turmoil in blood sugar readings? Hundreds of possibilities. Staph infections. Tooth aches. The flu. Steroids, cancer drugs, blood pressure meds. Chronic stress or highly strenuous activities. Pregnancy. Allergies. Allergic reactions to foods or cosmetics. Gout. IBS. Christmas and New Years holidays. Lack of sleep. Sleep apnea. Tumors. Tick bites, bee stings.\n\nThis is why control of diabetes requires a great deal of knowledge and understanding of how YOUR body reacts to different external stimuli (stress, foods, toiletries, pollutants, toxicants, preservatives, pesticides, drugs, etc, etc, etc, etc.................)\n\nThis is why each person's experience (and, therefore advice) about their diabetes is DIFFERENT and, often times, \"unhelpful\". Each person's lifestyle, living environment, work environment, acquaintances, daily routines, diet, age, cultural background is different. You don't think these factors can affect blood sugar readings? They do...more than you know!\n\nWhen a \"newbie\" comes, on board, they know so little about this disease. They have such limited experience to draw upon. They haven't the slightest inkling of how other parts of their lifestyle can significantly impact the rise and fall of their blood sugar (like the earthquake 1000 miles away). And, when you throw \"age\" into the equation, there is no possible way they can wrap their uninformed minds around this condition. For example, when I was young and starting my business, I could alter my routines and go two-three days with little to no sleep. I'm 61, now. If I tried that stunt, today, my blood sugar would go straight to hell and a handbasket. If your body is already compromised by diabetes, it takes very little at this age, to push you past the proverbial \"tipping point\". Unfortunately, Carrie Fisher, rest in peace, paid the ultimate price.\n\nYour doctor doesn't have the time (nor sufficient incentives, these days) to share this with you. This kind of info would do you little good, anyway. Thus, he tells you to eat lots of fruits and veggies, go easy on the red meat, go even easier on the alcohol, don't be so stupid as to smoke, drink plenty of water, get 7-8 hrs rack each night and always, always, always, perform exercise, everyday. These lifestyle \"habits\" quiet inflammation. They help to normalize blood sugar levels. They are \"anti-inflammatory\"; they calm the seas.\n\nIf you are anything like the last newbie I encountered, here, you will NOT thank me.

Diabetes is a disease triggered when blood glucose levels rise above normal limits and its implications and complications are severe and need to be taken seriously.\nThese complications occur faster and more often in those who neglect their illness and which have long episodes of hyperglycemia in their disease. It is well to remember that glucose is not causing organ damage but the products of abnormal processes in which the glucose enters – processes which grow proportional to the level of blood sugar.\n\nThe severe complications of diabetes are:\n\n1. Cardiovascular diseases – people with diabetes have a double risk of developing atherosclerosis, expressed by major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death.\n\nDiabetes accelerates the deposition of fats in large vessels and especially in the small ones, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The diabetic patient must regularly check his blood pressure, which must be maintained below 130/80 mmHg. Diabetes frequently registers blood fat abnormalities (dyslipidemia). These defects grow still further the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n2. Eye disease – diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes in which consists in the illness of small vessels in the retina, the lining of the eye responsible for sight.\nThe appearance of retinopathy is signaled by a decrease in vision. This can go up to a total loss of vision – blindness. Therefore, in an annual eye exam, it is required.\n\n3. Renal diseases\n\nDiabetic Nephropathy means kidney failure due to diabetes. If it remains untreated in time, it leads to kidney failure when a significant portion of the kidney is destroyed. The final stage of the renal failure is uremia, in which the patient must do dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive.\nDiabetic nephropathy has no symptoms, so it is necessary to detect it early with the help of annual albuminuria determination. The prevention of rapid progression of nephropathy requires a very good glycemic control.\n\n4. The diabetic foot – it refers to all modifications due to diabetes at the feet levels. In advanced stages of diabetes, the gangrene is reached, and it is most often located in one or more fingers, but it can extend to the entire foot.\nDiabetic arterial disease manifest itself at first by a sensation of cold feet, then as a feeling of “bite” at the pulp level which appears when moving and which it ceases at rest. Pain will occur more and more often and eventually even when resting.\nWhen the blood vessels are clogged, some areas of the foot die and gangrene occurs.\n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy manifests through pain in the legs (more intense at night), numbness and tingling legs, feeling “restless legs”. The diabetic foot patient has to take care of this problem and to respect some rules:\n\no Washing the feet daily with soap and warm water; the dry needs to be made by dabbing, especially the area between the toes with a clean towel;\no Nails will be cut straight, no corners;\no The socks need to be changed daily – use cotton stockings in the summer over which wool socks can be put in winter;\no Must wear comfortable shoes;\no Any injury to the leg must be treated immediately and if necessary resort to a surgeon;\no Extreme temperatures (heat-cold) must be avoided;\no Heating pads are not to be used by people with diabetes;\no Hot water bottles or ice packs at the level of the foot need to be avoided;\no Diabetic patients must not smoke because smoking decreases the blood flow in the legs;\no The feet need to be examined daily using a mirror;\no Tight socks must not be worn.\n\nEmergencies in diabetes\n\n1. Ketoacidosis occurs when there is not enough insulin in the blood, and the body begins to use fat instead of carbohydrates (sugar) for energy.\n\nThe symptoms of ketoacidosis are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, breath with the smell of acetone or “rotten apples”.\n\n2. Hypoglycemia – marked by the decrease in blood glucose.\n\nThe symptoms of hypoglycemia are: sweating, tremors, fatigue, feeling cold, irritability, hunger, headache, visual disturbances.\n\nThese symptoms usually appear before meals or after a strenuous exercise.\n\nSome complications can be kept under control and there are some things that can be done in order to decrease their complications but there are some cases – the emergencies – when the patient must see a doctor immediately.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16810145\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960830/\nhttps://hlbenefits.com/diabetes","like_count":"1","tags":["Diet","Type 2 Diabetes","Type 1 Diabetes"]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/2229/what-i-have-learned-about-the-severe-complications-of-diabetes-mellitus"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"Inflammation of prepuce","post_content":"I am suffering with tight foreskin of penis which is causing pain when retracting.

I thought it was normal to cough and snore throughout the night, so bad, I had to sleep in the den. I thought it was normal to get sore throats, headaches and constipation. I thought it was normal for my teeth to rot and my glasses become useless after a year. I thought it was normal to get into arguments with friends or co-workers. I thought it was normal for my back or hips to take the week off. I thought it was normal to avoid dark shirts because it looked like I'd been out in the snow.

A patient diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes is immediately started on insulin injections as that is the only way to control the disease.\n\nType 2 Diabetes is caused from the body not able to utilize the insulin that the pancreas is producing. This is also known as insulin resistance. A patient with Type 2 Diabetes is usually started on oral medications to both lower blood glucose levels and help the body use the insulin the pancreas is still producing.\n\nAfter that lengthy explanation, I will now answer your question. A Type 2 Diabetic can become insulin dependent because the beta cells in the pancreas can stop producing insulin.

My last A1C earlier this year: 5.0. The last time I tested over 6.0 was almost 9 years ago. I don't test anymore because I know how to keep my readings very low. But, I can easily make my readings soar by making a few changes to my lifestyle... sleep...diet...exercise...pressure...coffee...cigarettes...prescription drugs...alcohol...and, \"STRESS\".\n\nI'm a diabetic but I know the importance of maintaining a healthy, consistent, stable and happy lifestyle and how it \"controls\" my diabetes. That's why I don't test my blood sugar, anymore. But, make no mistake, I can easily become very diabetic, again, if I return to my abusive & toxic tendencies.\n\nBefore I address Ms. Ilene Raymond Rush's article on the importance to testing your blood sugar, I'd like to ask the (senior) members, here, a few questions.\n\nComparing 1966 to 2016:\n\n1. Is it easier or harder to find jobs that guarantee lifetime employment?\n2. Is it easier or harder to secure housing in a safe neighborhood with low crime rates and good schools?\n3. Is it easier of harder to afford a new car (or, the gas to put in it)?\n4. Is it safer or less safe to travel abroad?\n5. Is it more affordable of less affordable to put two kids through college?\n6. Is it more affordable or less affordable to get \"effective\" health insurance?\n7. Is it less dangerous or more dangerous driving the freeway?\n8. Is it less dangerous or more dangerous to be a person of color?\n9. Is it less dangerous or more dangerous to ask your neighbor if they could please turn the music down?\n10.Is your high school daughter less likely or more likely to get raped at a weekend get-together with \"friends\"?\n11. Are the chances of an early retirement more likely? Or, will you likely die on the job?\n\nObesity, Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease are climbing. Doctors still insist us to watch the diet, take the drugs and keep checking the blood sugar. My only question is this: If diabetes is all about the blood sugar (and everybody knows about proper diet, the importance of exercise and taking the drugs), are we, as a society, doing a better job preventing diabetes? Or, is it getting worse?\n\nLife is insanely more stressful than anytime in our history. I contend you cannot turn a blind eye to the effects of social and psychological stress on your body. The pressure is chronic, real and eminent.\n\nThe people who are reversing their T2D, today, are doing far more than counting carbs and logging numbers in a book. And, I think this article typifies the dogma and misinformation that diabetics must confront in trying to find effective solutions for their disease.\n"}],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/diabetes/693/3-lessons-learned-from-regular-testing"},{"post":{"author":"WebMD Addie","post_time":"over 3 years ago","post_title":"First 'Artificial Pancreas' for Type 1 Diabetes","post_content":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the first automated insulin delivery system -- a so-called \"artificial pancreas\" -- for people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nYou can read more about what the device does, when it will be available, and how this new technology could help with monitoring glucose and administering insulin here: http://wb.md/2d9Vtf9\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Do eat fruits and vegetables and think \"nutrition\" & \"fiber\" trumps whatever effect they may have on blood glucose.\n2. Don't eat too much processed (\"white\") carbs because they cause inflammation.\n3. Whether you eat or don't eat carbs, allow your digestive tract plenty of time to digest, rest and recover; Rest is the best medicine!\n\nA Healthy Body recovers from inflammation, quickly, and normalizes blood pressure, blood glucose and remove excess water and harmful wastes/toxins from the body, efficiently & expeditiously.\n\nA Unhealthy Body (diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease) does not recover from inflammation, quickly, therefore rest and stress relief of the body become a critical part of treatment. The people that suffer uncontrolled blood glucose work themselves to exhaustion, don't stop eating and don't manage stress, well. When you compound this lifestyle with poor sleep habits (or sleep apnea), the body eventually succumbs to tremendous pressure to repair and alleviate chronic inflammation. High blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides are inflammatory \"scoreboards\". Your body is weakening.\n\nNo two \"carbs\" are the same and there are clearly good carbs (natural, whole, fresh) and bad carbs (junk, white, processed). It's the lifestyle (of the diabetic) surrounding those carbs that determine whether your blood sugar remains well controlled or haywire. Thus, no two diabetics are the same, either.\n\nMy whole approach to medicine is simplistic and effective. No matter what condition you suffer, do not fall prey to \"treating\" a single disease! Focus on improving your health, instead, and let your body \"treat\" the disease for you. Remember, you can't have Type 2 Diabetes if you don't have high blood pressure or high cholesterol or obesity. What would a doctor prescribe for a patient that suffered from all 4 of these conditions (after completing will/last testament)?\n\n\nPS: I took my 92 yo mother for a complete eye exam, last week. It's been 2 years since her last. She takes no medications. I told her before she saw the optometrist, \"Mom, you have nothing to worry about.

I have done research on what drugs are available on line to keep your A1c level at a good range. My goal here is to inform people of what I know so that they can be their own advocates.\n\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Does anyone participate in these message boards?","resp_content":"\nSeems like it--- I don't see any message board participation\n\n"},{"author":"mrscora01","resp_time":"over 3 years ago","resp_title":"RE: Does anyone participate in these message boards?","resp_content":"Yes, these boards are very new. They have put in a new format, so I suspect all us old-timers might take a bit to get comfortable with the new look. Got any questions? I'm a long term type 1, but have familial experience (and have done a lot of reading) about type 2.

Have to scroll too much to see the posts (rather than just the titles) and when (if) people start posting a lot, it will mean a lot of effort to check out posts. I do like the listings along the side though. Very efficient.\nReply\nWebMD Riley\nover 3 years ago\nThanks! That's good feedback and thank you for sharing your thoughts! mrscora01\nReply\nbrunosbud\nover 3 years ago\nOdd transitioning from old to new boards...I'm not one to *** and moan so I'm willing to give this a try. Nothing improves without change and I'm hopeful this new board format will generate greater participation.\n\nDiabetes is so poorly understood by the average Joe/Jane and the consequences for misinformation and procrastination can be dire.\n\nThe beauty in treating diabetes is everyone can start, immediately, it requires little money to do so and, if you're not within 200 miles of the closest doctor, relax & don't panic...\n\nHopefully, we'll get a few curious visitors to ask for an explanation.\n1\nReply\nWebMD Addie\nover 3 years ago\nHi brunosbud Glad to see you made it onto our new boards. I know that many here will benefit from your experience and support here as they have in the past.
