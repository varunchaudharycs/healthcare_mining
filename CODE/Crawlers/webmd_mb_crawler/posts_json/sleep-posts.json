It's amazing how much a lack of quality sleep can affect daily living.\nIt was surprising to read your post as it is exactly what I struggled with for YEARS except I wasn't taking any medication. In my situation, it was all caused by the things I was ingesting. After being diagnosed with Celiac Disease and modifying my diet, my sleep quality improved. I went from sleeping 10 or 11 hrs a night and needing 2 hr naps to needing 9-ish hours and a nap occasionally. Still bothered by excessive sleeping from time to time, I again looked to my diet and discovered that both coffee and caffeine were the culprit. I have never been a regular coffee drinker but I do enjoy a cup a few times a week. What I discovered was that on the days I drank anything with caffeine or any coffee/espresso even decaf, my sleep that night suffered and I was lethargic the next day or so. I tried decaf coffee, black tea, green tea, jasmine tea, Red Bull, Brain Tonic, etc. I tried drinking it before noon and then before 10am but all modifications still affected my sleep. After going cold turkey and not enjoying any of the above, I found that each night my sleep was becoming better and better. It took about a week before I started getting quality sleep. It was extremely difficult to give up (and I relapsed multiple times as I love the taste of coffee and tea), but I've finally decided that the price of unrestful sleep is too high a price to pay for the enjoyment I was receiving. My life is much happier, healthier and energetic than ever before. I still can't keep up with those people who get by on less than 8 or 9 hrs, but it's a significant improvement for me and has positively affected my life.\nIt's a long story but I hope it helps!

Firstly, the medication prescribed by your doctor cause you to feel drowsy throughout the day and disrupt your sleep. In this case you must discuss with your doctor regarding your treatment and take the right decision together.Secondly, can sound stupid, but your pillow and mattress affects primarily your body during the sleep.

Sometimes I convince myself there are two of me and I have to really concentrate on myself to realise there is only one of me. I tend to either sit up or lie on my back as it happens as turning on my side seems extremely bizarre to me at the time and almost like I’m off balance, it also makes the shocks worse.

Sometimes they cause panic attacks but sometimes I can make it fade off by talking out loud, it depends how strong it is happening. It’s hard to explain and sounds crazy to type out!

I used to get it as a kid, then it stopped in my teens, only to come back when I was in my early 20s. Sometimes came before migraines, mostly at night though when trying to sleep. I was told that it can be an aura before a migraine. Also, some people experiences very different kinds of migraines than the headache kind. They can just be in your stomach and cause stomach pains, or all over your body rather than head. And these still have auras and pre and post migraine periods which have all sorts of weird symptoms - but unless you know you have atypical migraines then you don’t even realize that those experiences are related to each other and associated with a migraine.\nAlso, have you recently stopped any sort of antidepressant or similar medication? Your symptoms sound similar to discontinuation syndrome which can last for months after stopping some antidepressants.\nYour off balance sensation make me think of vertigo. Do you have neck pain? Even if you don’t, ever had an MRI of your neck? What about an MRI of your brain? Ear infections? Or anything involving your ear? Swollen lymph nodes near your ears? Have you had your thyroid tested? Labs and imaging (ultrasound or mri)?\nI was having balance issues and vertigo along with other symptoms that made my doctor order an MRI of my neck. Showed a herniated disc, but also a thyroid tumor even though my labs were normal. Biopsy came back suspicious, so they removed half of my thyroid. Afterward, a lot of things improved that I did not think related to my thyroid, like my vertigo. Turns out the tumor (even though it was small) was causing my thyroid to press on blood vessels or whatever, which affected blood flow to my ear/face/head, which caused ringing in my ear, a constantly itchy sensation in my ear and vertigo. What makes me think your symptoms could be caused by something similar is how it seems like they are dependent/improved by your position at night. Before my thyroid surgery, I noticed I would get this spinning sensation and other weird feelings if I was lying a certain way. Like facedown at the chiropractor. Or on my back in bed. Even if my neck was a certain way. I started using a cervical decompression device and it helped a lot, even before the surgery.\nDo your symptoms happen only when you are sleeping on your back? Is it only when you sit up that they get better? Maybe start noticing the position of your head and neck during those times - both how you are waking up when it happens and how you are positioned when you start to notice improvement. Also sometimes we let our head jut out like in an extended way in front of our chest, rather than keeping our neck and head in a straight line with our spine; so see if that is possible something you are doing at these times and if so try to correct it when it’s happening to see if anything changes. I still can’t sleep on my left side or I can get it. I think my blood flow was damaged for so long and there is probably scar tissue from the surgery that is still affect blood flow. Also, my herniated disc is to the left, so I think that makes it worse. Oh, also, anything that affects the flow of cerebral spinal fluid from your neck to your brain might be a trigger; head/neck position, any structural issues, etc. Have you tried using a cervical pillow to sleep on? Or fallen asleep with ice behind your neck? Maybe experiment with different solutions designed for people with cervical neck problems and see if your symptoms improve at all.\nAlso, have you been tested for a wide range of infections? Gone to an infectious disease specialist? When I have an infection or a fever it causes it to happen more often. And have you ever been tested for seizures? There are lots of kinds, not just the kind most people think of where a person shakes a lot. That can explain a lot of your symptoms too.\n\nGood luck. I hope you find a cause and solution very soon.

Hypersomnia? I need help...","post_content":"As a teenager, I slept a lot. My family assumed it was normal. However, looking back, I would sleep 12-14 hours at times, never feeling rested.\n\nIn my Early 20's.... I spent a lot of late nights partying and often didn't sleep but a few hours. For years, I equated my exhaustion with my life style.\n\nNow that I am in my 30's, I've become quite tame. I hardly drink alcohol and I entertain myself with house work. I have a great job and a wonderful wife. No kids and 3 cats.\n\nMy exhaustion has never left. Several years ago - my \"Sleep attacks\" started. Typically it was after a heavy meal - especially a big bowl of pasta! soon afterwards, I visited a Gastro Doctor and found out that I had a Gluten intolerance. Removing the Gluten from my diet defiantly helped with my stomach issues but the Sleep attacks persisted and gradually got worse.\n\nFor the last few years I started having trouble driving andfalling asleep. I would wake up and instantly feel the need to lay on the floor (in the shower) and take a nap. The morning lethargy was the worst for sure although it would sometimes effect me in the afternoon and more than not around 8 or 9 O'clock at night.\n\nAfter a 2 week run of falling asleep at the wheel daily, I went to a neurologist who diagnosed me with sleep apnea. I was given a APAP and Nuvigil for Daytime sleepiness. 6 months of APAP Theropy had shown significant progress in my sleep,although I still suffered from Lethargy and daytime exhaustion. There were a few days I forgot To take my Nuvigil in the morning and experienced terrifying Sleep attacks. One of the more recent was an episode of 5 different attacks with in a two hour span on my way to work. The others have included sleep attacks, a single Vivid hallucination and vision issues.\n\nAs for hallucinations - I do not typically have vivid visual hallucinations - I typically see movement out of the corner of my eye. More than not my Hallucinations are auditory. I will hear my name called or a single word or music while I am falling asleep or having a sleep attack! This auditory hallucination will often cause me alarm and I will jump at the sound but my alertness quickly changes back to lethargy in seconds.\n\nWhen I do have visual hallucinations - they are Typically while falling asleep or awaking from a dream. Again this is rare and I have only recently experienced these visual hallucinations during daytime sleep attacks. Specifically the vivid one - where I saw a man crossing the road with a blue plaid shirt, holding a 2x6 under his arm going to check the mail... While I looked for him as not to hit him (I was driving), I believe what I saw was the side of a house. I realize this seems crazy and I really can't explain it.\n\nMy Neurologist has asked me several times about Cataplexy and I don't believe I have experienced this. Then again, I am not one to be easily excited by laughter or anger. I have always been very even keel and laid back. However, I never mentioned this to my doctor but when I am dealing with a sleep attack, I feel like i could fall over. My head will nod and have a need to sit or lay down. I would compare the feeling to being up for days and finally standing in front of your bed. Is that lose of muscle control? I also notice that when I am in the midst of a sleep attack and trying to fight it, I feel a sudden jolt sensation - like a mild warm electrical current run through my arms, my hands and my upper torso. I just assumed that it was my body trying to keep me awake.\n\nIn the evenings, I typically become so tired that it I lack the energy to even sit up. Sometimes, I slump over and often struggle to keep awake. I have noticed that in this state, I have trouble comprehending what someone is saying to me. I also have trouble stringing words together to answer or express myself to the person I am talking to. I often express this state of being as feeling drugged or drunk. My eyes cross and when I speak my words tend to be slightly slurred or not crisply pronounced. I often will replace words with other words that aren't even in the context of what I am talking about (i.e. while talking recently about a cabinet - I referred to the hinge as a \"faucet\") or I will tell my wife I am going to bed because I am \"Sleep\".\n\nI am scared to miss a dose of my medication. I typically take my medication in the morning and sit for a little while and wait for it to kick in before I leave for work. With my Medication (250 Mg Nuvigil) - Its not like being on a medication like Adderall or Concerta where I feel awake and energized. I still feel tired at times during the day but the sleep attacks (if any) are very mild and I don't ever need to worry about falling asleep behind the wheel.\n\nSo here is my problem, I have no diagnosis. I was told that it could be Narcolepsy or Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Unfortunately, there is additional testing needed, Including a 2 day sleep study (or one night and one day). So at the moment, no one seems to know exactly why I experience what I do. I have read up on both and where I do see similarities in both - I don't feel that I am exactly 100% either.\n\nThis is effecting my work and my home life. My wife has implied that I am lazy and all I need to do is get up and move around. My boss has seen some changes is the quality of work I put out. I love my wife more than anyone in the world and I have a great job. I have a good life and I am scared this issue I am dealing with could destroy it all.\n\nI NEED HELP! Is there anything I can do in the meantime that will help me feel more awake? The Nuvigil has been a god send - but in the morning I have to wait for it to kick in and in the evenings after work, I come home, do a few chores and then sit until I feel my condition start to take over - then I don't move from the couch.\n\nI currently don't exercise and haven't for about 3-4 years. I use to Workout religiously! People told me it would make me feel better. Except it never did... I always felt exhausted after working out at the gym. My wife tried waking me up in the morning and make me walk around the neighborhood but prior to my medication, it didn't help... I would still have sleep attacks while driving to work. I have a diet that primarily consists of Vegetables, the occasional chicken breast or fish, No gluten or processed foods, limited alcohol (and if I do have a drink it is some sort of vodka drink 1 or 2 oz) - very limited soda intake (1 can a month or less).\n\nI am 34 years old, Male and I weigh 172 lbs.\n\nOther Diagnosis that I have-\n\nAnxiety disorder (controlled with medication- although recently hasn't done a great job)\nSleep apnea (controlled with APAP)\nGluten Intolerance (controlled with diet)\nPre-Hypertension (controlled with Diet - Typical blood pressure reading is 117-122 over 71-78)\nTrichotillomania and Dermatillomania (disorders probably related to my anxiety but have gotten worse over the past year)\nAttention Deficit Disorder (Not controlled since taking Nuvigil)\n\nAny insight or help on this issue would be great. I do have a sleep study coming up in January and I have been referred to John Hopkins Sleep Disorder Center but I am waiting to hear from my neurologist to see how to go about transitioning to another sleep center.\n\nI realize this all seems pretty bad (and it is) but I also feel that it is not as bad as it appears to be from this synopsis. These few paragraphs are so condensed and I have hit on the extremes of my condition. I Suffer every day but most are tolerable. I would even say hardly noticeable - It's the one day out of 10 or 20 that scares me half to death.\n\nSorry to write a book but I feel the more information I can provide, the better advice I receive.\n\nThanks to all who respond!","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[{"author":"MrsMoulton","resp_time":"8 months ago","resp_title":"RE: Narcolepsy?

I did it for the full month and it did nothing to help with anything not my IBS nor with my hypersomnia.and I totally understand the brain fog my doctor told me that once you have hypersomnia you will never get rid of it and that you will always have the brain fog sometimes it gets better sometimes it doesn't but you will never be the same. I know that's disheartening to hear and if you read my response to the other gentleman then maybe you will understand why my depression has gotten so bad... The medicine that you're taking is the one that gave me hallucinations so it wasn't an option for me the next one they put me on was Vyvanse but that didn't work at all the only thing that seems to somewhat work is the adderal...

But the medicine they put me on to stay awake give me hallucinations so they took me off that and put me on another but it didn't work at all they ended up putting me on adderal 30 mg in the morning and then 20 in the afternoon. we're still fooling around with that because sometimes the 20 is not enough and I can only work 5 hours in the morning because that's the only time I'm the most awake... I did do the sleep study, I do not have sleep apnea. That is what the first study is for. But the second one definitely showed that I have hypersomnia I was asleep within 2 minutes of each of the five naps.. I am not allowed to drive still, because of how many times I have fallen asleep behind the wheel.I have fallen asleep standing at the stove cooking dinner and just fell straight backwards and kept sleeping until one of my kids found me and woke me up. I have fallen asleep during conversations, I have fallen asleep during eating, I have fallen asleep during sex, even falling asleep multiple times at work...

Hypersomnia? I need help...","resp_content":"I just came across your post and have a few ideas hopefully you haven’t yet been tested for and ruled out. Some of your symptoms are similar to mine. Mainly the overwhelming tiredness, the progression over time, getting a wave of that can’t keep my eyes open feeling after eating, and the lack of anything helping (except sometimes Adderall). I also have other health problems, including severe pain, which led doctors over the years to run all kinds of tests. After more than a decade, I finally have answers. Have you ever been tested for any of the following:\n-Elhers Danlos (there are several types, all but 1 can be tested for genetically. The 1 that cannot is the 1 that has more generalized symptoms include severe fatigue)\n-Mast Cell Activation Disorder (few different types; basically an overreaction of your mast cells and histamine in your body. Wide range of symptoms; your gluten intolerance, stomach issues, anxiety, and fatigue would all fall in that category. Nuvigil/Provigil are actually histamine-releasing medications; histamine is somehow closely related to our circadian rhythm and sleep/wake cycle. Too much histamine has a negative effect in people with Mast Cell Disorders. When I’ve taken Nuvigil before, it worked great for the first few days and then didn’t do anything, even made me more tired. It seemed impossible to build a tolerance that quickly and supposedly the medication is more tolerance-resistant than stimulants like Adderall. Went to an allergist for what I thought were unrelated issues, and he thought I could have mast cell disorder. There are lists online of medications, food, etc that are high in histamine or set off a chain reaction that releases histamine. Nuvigil/Provigil is a major one. When I read through the list, I noticed that almost all of the foods that I have felt made me feel crappy are on it. Now I take Monteleukast nightly for about 6 weeks and it has helped a lot.\n-Hyperparathyroidism: not related to your thyroid except in location; 4 tiny glands that can really mess things up if they are enlarged or not functioning properly. Hardly ever tested for by most doctors, even by most endocrinologists. Most just run basic thyroid tests if you tell them you are tired (I imagine your doctor tested your thyroid; however your labs can come back normal and you could still have an adenoma on your thyroid affecting its function, only seen by ultrasound or MRI).\n-Epstein-Barr (EBV)\n-Lyme disease (not only from ticks, also spiders; not always bulls-eye pattern rash after infection)\n-Autoimmune disorders (find a good rheumatologist, or at least have your GP test your ANA to see if it is positive, which would suggest an autoimmune disease based on its level and pattern)\n\nGood luck. Hope you figure out the cause soon and begin a successful treatment. Hang in there. Took me over a decade (I’m also in my early 30s, which I think helps with finding a diagnosis bc things start to get bad enough to elevate labs, etc). If you have good insurance, go see a wide variety of specialists. Most specialists think only in their speciality. Rheumatology, endocrinology, immunology seem like specialists that might be beneficial for you.

CPAP machines work for many people, but some people find it very hard to get used to, although nowadays there are very sophisticated ones available.

Dental appliances work for many people, but again some people find it hard to sleep with something in their mouth. (The theory behind dental appliances and chin straps is that they keep your mouth closed, which keeps your tongue pulled up and forwards, and that makes the breathing passage at the back of the throate larger or prevents obstruction.) Chin straps and dental appliance will cure mild to moderate sleep apnea where it is only a matter of the positioning of the tongue, but won't help with severe sleep apnea. The standard neoprene chin straps are poorly designed and don't really work because they exert a force directly into the jaw joint. The exception to this is the Knightsbridge dual band chin strap ( https://www.dualbandchinstrap.com) which produces vertical lift on the jaw. Many people find it helpful to use a nasal dilator in combination with a chin strap or dental appliance since that helps with the required nose breathing.

Not a typical sleep apnea candidate. 5'8, 155 pounds and quite in shape/muscular. Only a 15\" neck size. Possibly a larger tongue than normal. Since I was in my early teenage years (possibly even before), I've felt exhausted every day no matter how much I slept. Later elementary school and high school was awful for me. I have days when I feel so tired that it seems hard to focus enough to say my words without slurring them or speaking with a lisp. I have never been able to focus enough mentally to feel that I can drive safely, so I haven't. I wake up some mornings with very deep tooth impressions on the sides and top edge of my tongue. I've had all sorts of blood tests and medical checks, including thyroid. All were fine. I had an in-lab sleep study. They noted a 4.7AHI and an 18.1RDI with 50 unclassified breathing events. My SPO2 levels were said to not drop like someone with sleep apnea, yet the sleep doctor said that my scalloped tongue is a classic sign of sleep apnea. I only slept a total of 2.75 hours for the entire night of the study. I had a brain MRI, which showed nothing usual. My ENT doctor requested a CT scan of my sinuses and noted a deviated septum right right-sided spurring and enlarged turbinates. I had surgery for both of those (successful) in July 2018. Still have awful sleep issues. I get 10-12 hours of sleep and wake up feeling like I've had 4-5 with no energy. The sleep doctor said I don't have sleep apnea because I'm 0.3 away from the 5.0 AHI required to officially diagnose sleep apnea. I have wondered if I have UARS or some other sleep condition. I'm waiting on the results to come back from my home sleep study that I requested for myself (didn't need a doctor to schedule it) because I felt like the sleep lab was incompetent in diagnosing me. My sleep efficiency in the in-lab study was noted at 40%. Over the 2.75 hours that I slept for the whole night of the study, I got like 44 minutes of N1 sleep, 86.5 minutes of N2 sleep, 28.5 minutes of N3 sleep and 7.5 minutes of R sleep. I woke up one night a few weeks ago and let out a big gasp for air and my entire body felt tingly all over, but that has only happened one time (that I am aware of, but could be happening more). What else could be causing me to feel so awful? If I sit in my computer chair at home, I'm prone to falling asleep. I also drift while on a city bus or as a passenger in a car.

I am unfortunately a very light sleeper and I wake up to the slightest of movement, noise, touch or even changes in lighting. When I am awakened in this manner, for a split second I wake up violently, such as swinging at or grabbing a person if I'm touched, luckily for the most part I quickly realize the situation and am able to stop myself in most cases. Some examples are when I was a kid and my mother would try to wake me, just her touching my bed would casue an reaction. Now here in my adult life, I work as a firefighter and one of the guys got up in the middle of the night and pulled the pull string on the ceiling fan at the foot of my bed to shut it off, all it was, was the slight clicking sound to wake me up and I was flying out of the bed first raised. Another example, which is the last I'll mention was while I was asleep one night at the fire house, the light was on in the bunk room and of course doing what firefighters do they were going pull a prank on me. Before anyone even touched me I was awoken and grabbed one of them by the neck. The only thing we could contribute was that a shadow was cast over my eyes, and caused me to wake.. One thing I have always noticed is that in not just noises that cause it, as I love to sleep with fans running and other noises or things that are going on when I go to sleep don't bother me, it's new things or changes that wake me.

So, ever since i was literally 8 i’ve been thinking that i have sleep paralysis, key word thinking. My earliest memory is when i was 8 and i was sleeping in the car and i remember not being able to move or breathe, and i didn’t even know what SP was at that time. For the first remainder of my life, not breathing was always associated with it, but that’s besides the point. Anyway, i know for a fact that it can’t be sleep paralysis now because i notice when it happens, i can move a little bit, but barely, almost like i’m jolting around trying to move tirelessly, and sometimes i can even jolt myself out of bed when it happens, but i wake up and i’m in bed?? and sometimes wearing different clothes from when i had the “sleep paralysis”. but it feels so real every time and i try to remind myself every time that it isn’t real and try it jolt myself up but it doesn’t work. So it’s obvious that i’m dreaming of having sleep paralysis, but why? this is the most likely answer, but why have i been having that same type of dream ever since i was little? and why does it happen literally all of the time? it happens at LEAST twice a week lately and right when i fall asleep, which is also unusual bc you don’t usually dream until 90 minutes after falling asleep. Also every time it happens and i wake up, i try to go back to sleep and it happens again, and this cycle occurs at least three times.

This is because he has a rare allergy to an ingredient that is found in a lot of common pill-form medicines.

Online Mayo Clinic talks about them at this link: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/in-depth/cpap/art-20044164\nI could not tolerate using the machine, so my dentist recommended an inexpensive device called a TSD (Tongue Stabilizing Device) which keeps you able to breath while asleep. You insert your tongue and the outer air pressure keeps it tightly on. It makes you look as if you are sticking out your tongue at your sleep, but It works for me. Check with your dentist.\n"},{"author":"kerryb0104","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"RE: Fed up of no sleep!","resp_content":"Thank you for your advice.

Is this a real thing?","post_content":"So not sure where to post something like this, but here goes. My wife and I have been married for 10 years and in the last week or so her behavior and sleeping patterns have changed. I woke up one night to the sounds of her masturbating in bed next to me. I didn’t really think much about it besides being super excited that something like that was happening. We have talked about masturbation but she either was never open about talking about it or was telling the truth that she doesn’t really do it. I always encouraged her to do it but she always just said she wasn’t into it. Back to the story at hand. So the first night I woke up to her masturbating, and all seemed pretty normal. She did her business and went to bed. Then the next night she did it again, and again did her business and was done. The last 5 nights or so, the frequency has really picked up. She has done it every night with it getting more and more vigorous (for lack of a better word) as each night has progressed. It has gone from just doing it once before she goes to bed to her now doing it 5 and 6 times a night. It seems to happen every time she suddenly wakes up. The last two nights especially I have not slept because of it. It seems to be happening at least every hour, if not more. I have read a little about sexsomnia in the past few days and have also read others stories. To try and keep a super long story short, is this something that could be a possibility? I only ask because in 10 years of marriage, this has never happened before. It seems to have come out of no where. I haven’t brought it up because honestly if it isn’t that and she enjoys doing it, who am I to say she shouldn’t. It is just tough because I haven’t been sleeping partly just due to the excitement that this is really happening. Part of me thinks it could be something where she is finally open to doing that but it has just been so sudden, and when she does do it, she really gets into it, and normally she is pretty reserved about things like that. I think it also could be about her possibly being attracted to someone else, considering each night she does start it willingly before she goes to bed. That in itself is also something I have never noticed until now. She just wouldn’t normally do that willingly in the bed right next to me. Lately I have been going to bed before her because I wake up a lot earlier then she does, whereas it used to be her always going to bed first. When she has started before she goes to sleep, it tends to just be light playing, she orgasms then goes to bed. In the middle of the night is when it gets crazy. The last few nights she has been moaning more when she sleeps, plus the masturbation has gotten to a whole new level. She thrusts her hips up, inserts larger things (usually pretty firmly), fondles herself all over and genuinely goes pretty crazy. It just seems odd But based on the fact that she does start it before bed, she could just really wanting To get off that badly, whether it is someone else or just her now being comfortable with it. Not sure what to think really. She doesn’t want sex all that often and all of a sudden out of nowhere she is going crazy pleasuring herself. But if it is her just enjoying this new found self love, she is hardly being discreet about it. I guess that is what makes it so odd. Anyway not sure what else to put but some feedback is always appreciated.","like_count":"0","tags":[]},"responses":[],"post_url":"https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/79898/sexsomnia-is-this-a-real-thing"},{"post":{"author":"Anonymous","post_time":"over 1 year ago","post_title":"Medication","post_content":"I am on a medication for chronic insomnia but it doesn't seem to exist in the list of medication under either name.

First, I don’t think I have slept more than 6 hours since I was in my 20’s (I am 59) and I was always an early riser (around 530-6 am). I guess my first occurrence of insomnia first started about 13 years ago where I couldn’t get to sleep because my brain wouldn’t shut up. My family physician put me on a low dose of Xanax and that seemed to do the trick. About 2-3 years ago my insomnia changed from not being able to get to sleep to not being able to sleep through the night (generally I have no problem getting to sleep). Initially I would get about five hours to now where I am lucky to get four hours of solid sleep. What I find unusual is that most nights it is four hours and then I just wake up, no feeling that something woke me up. I can’t remember the last time I had a dream. I have read many articles, youtube, etc about what to do to stay asleep and I have been doing them all for months with no success. I am currently on 2 mg lorazepam (family dr) and I have tried some herbal remedies (valerian, melatonin, and a milk mixture with four different spices) with no success. I even saw a sleep medicine doctor at a prestigious university medical center about two hours from my home which in my opinion turned out to be a waste of time since the doctor just entered everything I had written down into the computer – the entire visit was less than 30 minutes! The doctor’s (or maybe the computer’s) recommendation was to do CBTI however I live in an area where there isn’t anyone with any level of expertise with CBTI. I have checked out some of the online CBTI apps and will probably try one of them but I am hoping someone out there knows of something to try.

They completely disappeared. Many nights I would sit in the living room until 5 a.m. because I was afraid to go to sleep. Prazosin, as far as I understand is used to treat PTSD and other things as well. When you experience PTSD, your body can produce too much adrenaline, which in turn can make you have sleep problems and nightmares. The Prazosin blocks some of the effects of the extra adrenaline released in your body helping the nightmares to diminish and allows you to get better sleep. What you're describing sounds more like night terrors than nightmares. The difference is nightmares you usually remember, night terrors are experienced more as feelings, not dreams, so people don't recall why they are terrified upon awakening. I wonder if Prazosin can help something like that. One last thing night terrors are uncommon in adults, they usually affect children and they usually will outgrow them. I'm not very knowledgeable about night terrors in adults. I learned about them in children when my grandson was going through night terrors and of course I was very concerned.

This is going to be a long post, so sorry for that.\n\nHe’s 68 years old and for several years now he has had weird sleep patterns.\nDue to his job, he worked night and day, so that probably messed him up. On top of that, he was very attached to his job and lost it when he was 63, he got depressed and never accepted help. He spent nights on his computer playing video games. He got over his depression when he retired and got his pension (he was worried about his financial situation after retiring, and once he did he felt very relieved), but he still spends his entire life on his computer. Even when he watches a movie on TV he sits behind his screen.\n\nAnyway, on top of all the issues he clearly has, he has this disorder (irregular sleep wake rhythm https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-disorders/circadian-rhythm/irregular-sleep-wake-rhythm/) , he may go to bed at 9am, wake up at 2pm and have lunch, go back to sleep at 6pm and take a nap... he falls asleep on the couch during the daycare, etc. He can spend days at home without going out.\n\nI’m worried about him but I’m more concerned about my mom, as this affects her life as you can imagine and my dad acts like a selfish person. She no longer makes plans with him and refuses to go on vacation with him because he spends the day sleeping.\n\nI have given him tons of advice, but he hates it. He’s by far the most stubborn person I know.\n\nLast weekend I was at their place with my husband and our baby and barely saw him. One evening we went out for dinner and he didn’t come because he was sleeping. As you see, this interferes with his entire life.\n\nToday I sent him the article I pasted above ( https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-disorders/circadian-rhythm/irregular-sleep-wake-rhythm/) and told him I think he has this disorder. He admitted he knows he has a problem. Now I wonder how to help, and what he should do. He’s very skeptical regarding doctors and I doubt I can convince him to go to one.\n\nDo you have any advice on what he could do? Is anyone familiar with this problem? I told him he should have a schedule of daily tasks and stop using screens in the evening. He said he’s going to take melatonin too.\n\nThis is hard because he’s a pessimistic, stubborn old man.

After this I would start to notice my heart beat increasing in speed, eventually pounding very fast and loudly. It would continue to do this for at least 2 minutes. During this time I would feel very sick, and the first time it happened I actually experienced diarrhoea. After these attacks my body feels tingly and shaky. I have been experiencing tinnitus for the past year, which has been steadily getting worse. I have depression and am taking Lovan, but have never had this kind of attack happen during the day. Nothing in particular seems to trigger this, but it always happens during the night after I get up and use the toilet. Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated!

On average, most of us complete 4 to 6 cycles of sleep each night, each ending typically with a REM dream stage.\n\nMoreover, dreaming is thought to be a continuous process during sleep, with the REM stage having the most vivid and memorable dreams.\n\nFurther, the fact that you are dreaming, regardless of content, is good. It shows you are in fact sleeping and reaping the benefits of sleep, particularly the most refreshing NREM sleep stages that normally precede the REM stages.\n\nMy suggestion would be to remember that dreams are only that -- dreams. Regardless of content, they cannot hurt you.\n\nYou might consider counseling if you are feeling depressed, and you might also consider healthy ways to live a sleep supportive lifestyle. Most of them are contained in CBT sleep training programs.

Long term depression, ptsd, various anxieties, unable without stimulation of tv and/or net, to not have thoughts think back with sadness and forward with anxieties. I started with 3mg hr before bed nightly. Worked quite well usually. Sometimes if no sleep after hr trying, a 2nd worked within 1/2 hrish. After about 1/2 yr, started needing more. Tried combining it with baby asperin which worked well again with single dose. Sometimes woke after 3-4 hrs. Found from research it gets metabolised, used up, after 3-4 hrs. Also that we have 2 sleep cycles of 3-4 hrs each. Maybe incase we need to pee. We either don't wake or go right back to sleep if no need felt to get up. I switched to dual melatonin pills which have both fast dissolve 5mg white and delayed dissolve 5mg blue. Kept taking baby asperin with it. Because research found melatonin triggers more then just sleep, also body repair and replacement of old or damaged cells, similar to what happens when fasting for 2-4 days. So see no harm in it other then increased reliance and sometimes needing extra for same effect. Baby asperin not only boosts effect, but helps dissolve artery buildup of junk, reducing odds of clot, stroke, etc. This combo usually worked well for about 5 yrs. Then about yr ago, started having sleep issue. So after hr no sleep, was often taking 2nd dose. It worked, but noticed my over thinking, anxieties and depression got worse. I figured maybe I was getting that from too much serotonin build up in brain. Because, tryptophan from food is converted in gut by good gut bacteria to 5-htp, which brain absorbs from blood to make serotonin. The daytime for thinking chemical. When it wants sleep, it releases chemical that converts serotonin to melatonin. So, too much too often melatonin pills, may leave behind buildup of serotonin that normally would have been converted to melatonin. Realising this possibility, I tried not to take 2nd dual mel. Instead a single fast dissolve 5mg mel. If needed after hr of trying. Or have piece of chicken, turkey, cheese, warm milk, honey, coco (no sugar sweeten with honey). This usually worked. The odd time maybe a 2nd baby asperin with 2nd mel. More then 1 baby asa/day can cause issues so caution there. Especially if other meds involved. I got off the prescript SSRI anti-depression pills about yr after starting the mel. As SSRIs keep serotonin around more. So with regular use of mel, ssri may not be needed. Which I found after few weeks adjusting telling myself to count positives more then negatives, worked out ok. After these 7 yrs, I've found I sometimes have to resort to shelf \"Sleep-Aid\". Not good too often. But it's likely only due to my many regrets of past, which haunt me when I try to sleep with nothing else to think about. So in conclusion, it seems safe to take mel regularly, even the baby asperin. But maybe better to try without, going to bed hr earlier then you need. The hr later if needed, take em. On nights when it doesn't really matter how long it takes to get to sleep, maybe best to not get frustrated and just keep eyes closed in dark quiet area as you'll likely eventually get to sleep.\n1\n"},{"author":"indeliblemark","resp_time":"over 1 year ago","resp_title":"Thanks cam, I feel pleased and warm the amount of information you shared.

So I've decided to come here because I'm seriously getting fed up with this.\n\nIt's basically this: When I'm sleeping with someone else in the room (my boyfriend, one of my friends, brother etc) before I fall asleep or just after I wake up, I tend to respond to them though no one's said anything!\n\nNOTE: This happens ONLY when I fall asleep or wake up near other people.\n\nI can genuinely clearly remember hearing and seeing things, they seem like hallucinations. On bad days this can happen like 5 times in a row. It's not like I'm dreaming, I am aware that I am awake, and that's what makes this so strange to me.\n\n--------\n\nFor example: My boyfriend and I were watching the Pokemon movie with Entei. I clearly remember a bunch of Chikorita happily jumping up against a fence. So I said \"awww, look at those cute Chikorita!\" and my boyfriend was like \"... But there's no Chikorita\". So I looked at the screen and it showed some Pokemon in the snow.\n\nAnother example is when my friend stayed over a couple of days ago. I responded to her SO many times though she never said anything. And I clearly remember I had to tell myself \"Nope, don't respond yet... Just look at her first\" so I looked over and she was fast asleep.\n\nAnd yet another example I clearly remember. I remember my boyfriend asked me to watch something on Netflix with me. He was looking towards me laying on his side. I said \"Nah, don't really feel like it\" and my boyfriend was like \"... Huh?\" so I looked over and he was lying down playing his 3DS with his back towards me. It's honestly annoying to keep apologizing because it's one of those times again.\n\nI've tried looking it up on Google but I can't seem to find anything. It's getting extremely annoying and I wonder if anyone knew what it was.

I had a dream when I was about 9 years old and it was so scary and real I could never forget. I was in a room and there were creatures around yelling and laughing gibberish stuff. Then there was a man with a really big head yelling as loud as he could at me. It was all gibberish so nothing he said was real words but I knew what he was telling me somehow.\nHe was telling me to touch a block with my hand and then touch another one on the other side of the room without letting go of the first one. I couldn't do that because they were too far apart so I was getting afraid When he started yelling louder. When I woke up(i was really awake entirely, not still dreaming) the unbearably loud noise that was happening and the amount of color and the creatures and man were still there. I could hear everything from the dream and no other noise from the world around me because it was so loud(even when my mom was trying to talk to me). When I opened my eyes, I looked at the walls and I could still see everything in the dream perfectly. When I closed my eyes it was still there. It would not go away so I was even more agitated. I went to my parents (I walked down the hall and none of the sounds or visuals stopped) and climbed into their bed, cried and screamed until eventually I passed out because I was so tired. I woke up the next morning feeling okay but every once in a while for YEARS NOW, if I hear a noise(anything, even an air conditioner going off one time) I can suddenly hear the man yelling and it's still so vivid and really loud at times. I haven't had the problem of triggering the noise in about 2 years now but I was just wondering why this all happened because it was the scariest time of my life and I was only maybe 8 or 9 so it sort of? traumatised me.

Stick with your wakeup time. Try planning something that you really look forward to doing first thing. If not school, make it something else. I suspect your wakeup issues have more to do with motivation (or lack thereof) and not a sleep issue per se.\n\nSecond, do not nap, and do not allow yourself to sleep in, even on weekends. Doing these kinds of things will probably increase your sleep drive, so that you feel drowsy closer to your bed time.\n\nThe other thing you should try I think is setting an earlier bed time. You don't say your age, but I suspect if you're a teenager you probably need closer to 9 plus hours of sleep at night. This would explain the exhaustion, which in turn could be leading you to more stressful days, which in turn could explain the nightmares.\n\nYou might also try planning a relaxing wind-down period a good hour before your scheduled bedtime. A relaxing bath, getting your clothes ready for morning, some herbal tea, whatever helps you relax. Avoid stress, and avoid stimulation during this time. This will help you transition to sleep better.\n\nAvoid melatonin, especially if you're a teenager. It's a systemic hormone with an unknown long term effect on sexual development. There are better ways, particularly with setting and keeping a consistent sleep-wake schedule.\n"},{"author":"Anonymous","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"morpheus15: Thank you so much!

Sounds like a number of things could be going on, such as a conditioned negative response to your bed -- so that even if you feel drowsy your bed becomes a cue for wakefulness and dread, based on the many hours you've spent tossing and turning in frustration. Many of us have been there, done that.\n\nBut I have to say if \"before you know it's morning\" then you are likely in fact sleeping a whole lot more than you think you are. This is also common, and known as sleep state misperception.\n\nOften times it's our negative perception and expectation that fuels the problem.\n\nAll this can be undone.

It’s serious. Can lead to Parkinson’s or Lewy Body. My husband has Sleep apnea and wears a CPAP. RBD means that when you are in the REM mode, when you dream, you are not just dreaming, but acting out your dream. So if you think in your dream that someone is chasing you or threatening you, you do what you would do if you were in the situation: punching, hitting, cussing loudly, and jumping out of bed. Sadly, you can injure yourself. My husband has hit the slider in his sleep (scar) and impaled himself on the side table (adam’s apple). Could be dangerous if you sleep near a staircase or door. I got large tubular pillows to put on either side of him in bed, and he has not had any further accidents. See a sleep specialist. And don’t let your spouse sleep with you. My husband hit me once and I woke up once with his fist dangling over my face. Not to mention the very LOUD cussing. I’ve had to warn nurses in hospitals that he does this. It used to be once in a while, now at least 4 times a week and up to 8 times in one night.

I don't doubt that the fact that mornings are dark at this time of year is partly to blame, but that alone can't be the only reason.\n\nI have my alarms set to 5am and 5:30, but more and more I am getting up at 6 or closer to 6:30, and therefore have an hour or less to prepare before I'm catching my bus. This has resulted in me getting to work at 8-8:15am, which means I have no \"me time\" before I have to boot up my work computer and start cracking (I have a desk job). If I could just get up at 5:30 am at the latest, then I wouldn't be cutting things this close to the wire. Lately, I've had to choose between eating breakfast, taking a shower, or making lunch (showers have always taken precedence, since I can always buy breakfast and lunch, but that's not a good habit to be falling back on. In a perfect world, I take showers the night before, but life isn't always perfect).\n\nNow, here is another piece that makes this situation more frustrating: If I am to wake up at 5-5:30 am with the suggested amount of sleep (8-10 hours), that means I have to be ASLEEP by 7-9 pm! Which then means I have to be in BED by some ungodly hour because all my life it has taken me a good hour or two (or three; I never look at the clock when I'm trying to sleep because that would make it worse) to actually fall asleep. With getting home after work between 5:30 and 6 pm, that's just not possible. There is no way I can get the suggested hours for healthy sleep, which means I always will be struggling to get out of bed. I worry I will be sleeping in later and later with each day until I am consistently getting to work late. I can't even force myself to turn my bedside lamp on, and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on some smart lamp with daylight-imitating bulbs.\n\nI am 28 years old and relatively healthy. There is no reason why this should be getting worse for me already at so young an age. No articles out there have any solutions that I've found to work for me. And on top of it all, I have always been a morning person. Once I actually get OUT of bed and drink a warm cup of tea, I am fine. But getting physically out of bed and keeping my eyes open before that is what is getting worse with each passing day.\n\nI apologize for the essay, but I wanted to be as detailed as possible.

I've always had the hardest time falling asleep. Apparently, even my mom took a long time to fall asleep when she was my age. I lie in bed, eyes closed, trying to get comfortable and relax, but sleep doesn't really come to me. However, I do indeed feel sleepy and tired when I get into bed - I can no longer stay up as late as I used to (but that's due to having done higher education and getting a full-time job). When I'm feeling sleepy, I get into bed. What's so odd is that, yes, I am feeling \"ready\" for sleep, I just can't fall asleep within an hour.\n\n2. Yes, I do tend to watch a movie or TV before I go to bed, but the thing is...by the time it is over (between 8 or 10 pm, depending on what I watched and how early I started it), I am sleepy and ready for bed, and I make a bee-line straight for my room. I never watch TV/movies in my bedroom, always in the living room. I do read a little bit in bed if I feel up for it, but that's usually only for 15 minutes at a time. I've set my phone so that it has the \"night light\" on between 8 pm and 4 am.\n\n3. I would exercise...if I ever felt up for it. Instead (especially during fall and winter), the first thing I want to do when I get home from work is relax, get comfortable, and do nothing. And even if I did exercise, I probably would only do something light like lifting light dumbbells.

The two components, when synchronized and working well together, can make sleep when you want practically irresistible.\n\nConsistency helps the two systems work well together. That means especially the same wake up time each morning, 7 days a week. And a very similar bed time each night as well.\n\nIf you are not drowsy at your scheduled bed time, you might try moving that back an hour or so, while keeping the wake time consistent. See what happens.\n\nIf you are otherwise healthy, doing something as simple as that may be all you need to restore your sleep to where you want it. Of course watching any caffeine intake, getting daily exercise, and so forth, are also important.\n\nIf this continues to bother you, then a check up with your doc is important to either treat or rule out an underlying medical issue.\n\nAs for the psychological part, check out adult sleep training methods based on CBT -- cognitive behavioral therapy.

I've lost my mental sharpness and have become very irritable which has taken its toll on me personally and professionally.\n\nSo I did an experiment in an effort to narrow down the scope of what is causing my issues.

What is interesting is that while I was at sea level, my SPO2 levels seem normal, hardly ever dropping below 90% (less than 1% of the time). However when at altitude, my SPO2 falls below 90%, which totalled 50 - 70% of my sleep time.

If you do, continue to work with your doc to address those and your sleep should improve.\n\nBut key is if you don't. If you don't have for instance a psychiatric disorder such as depression (doxepin is an anti-depressant) then you might consider the possibility that these pills are only treating the symptom, not the true root of the problem. Confirm this with your doc.\n\nIf you have what's known as primary insomnia -- meaning sleep problems without an identifiable medical basis -- then you have the most common type. It typically is caused by some combination of bad sleep habits and excessive worry about the idea of sleep.\n\nCBT sleep training methods specifically designed for adults is what's typically recommended first for primary insomnia. CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy. It is entirely drug free and gets to the true root of the problem for most people.

In the meantime he had sent in a requisition, they were following up a \"Barium Swallow Test\" with a Modified Barium Swallow\" Or \"Cookie Test\" as it was once known. I have a serious problem every since I had to have surgery for biopsies on my lungs 3 years ago. They had to cut the outside of my throat at the bottom just where the bone at the base of the throat turns into a \"V\" shape. Well a couple of weeks after initial healing I started having these problem, I've told my doctor now for just over 3 years. The physician and dietician who performed these tests seem to think it could have been a cut nerve which is hindering the little thing that cover the windpipe not to open and close properly. When I mentioned this he said well Dr.Clifton (an ear, nose and throat ) specialist checked my vocal cords back in 2015 while he was suppose to be checking my sinus's as I have a lot of allergies also.

Now at 29, I find myself continuing these horrible sleeping patterns.\n\nMy question is: is it possible to repair the damage that's being done to my brain? I've read countless articles about how you lose brain cells and all of the other ailments sleep deprivation leads to. I'm trying hard to overcome my unhealthy sleeping patterns, but this is me trying to unlearn a lifetime of terrible habits, and I clearly haven't overcome them yet.\n\nI already suffer from some things that I'm are most likely due to chronic sleep deprivation: memory loss, trouble recognizing people I've seen before, chronic worrying, depression, lack of motivation, irritability, heart problems (irregular heart beat), fatigue and emotional instability (I can sometimes cry at the drop of a hat, but suppress this in public and work spaces).\n\nHas anyone been on the same boat and turned their life around? Is it possible for me to repair my brain? I just need to know if there's some sort of hope, because as terrible as I am to myself, I want to do what I can to recover and restore. I'm so worried about irreversible brain damage and what that will do to my career and quality of life.\n\nI don't need convincing on how important sleep is and I'm aware that I have a problem that needs to change immediately. As much of a challenge as it's been, I intend to sleep better and practice meditation and other healthier habits more.\n\nIn case other health factors need to be taken into consideration: I try to eat as many plant-based food as possible (but am not vegetarian), the only drug I occasionally do is marijuana (and that's 1-4 times a month if at all) through a hit or two of a pipe, I drink coffee to stay awake, although it doesn't help much, and I don't exercise enough, although that's also something I intend to change. I'm not overweight, although I'm not fit and have vitamin deficiency (D and B) and osteopenia.\n\nI know I'm a hot mess, but I'm determined to change.

But I think you may have hit the nail on the head with your \"self-sabotoging\" comment, though possibly in a way you didn't intend.\n\nFirst, how do you know you've gotten \"3-6\" hours of sleep since kindergarten? Were you tracking sleep back then? Do you now. When you examine this belief, I suspect you'll probably find it is inaccurate.\n\nIt is quite common for insomniacs to have false and inaccurate beliefs about sleep, and to catastrophize those. This negativity in turn helps fuel and perpetuate the insomnia. It's a vicious circle.\n\nSecond, how do you know your insomnia is causing all those various maladies you cite? How do you know it's not the other way 'round? It's true insomnia is associated with various issues, but the direction of causality is often difficult to determine.\n\nThe bottom line is as you correct state your determination to make this better. And you can. I'd start with the preconceived idea that you've somehow done \"irreparable damage\" to yourself. That is more than likely a fact-free assertion you can safely let go. Doing so won't hurt you, it will in fact help you immensely.\n\nThat brings us to exactly how you can make this better. Start with your lifestyle and habits. Are you drinking coffee after about mid-day? That'll keep you up. Getting exercise most every day is one of the very best things you can do to improve your sleep.\n\nIf you haven't had a checkup recently that might be a good idea to either treat or rule out any underlying medical issues affecting your sleep. But most insomnia actually has nonmedical roots.\n\nCheck out CBT sleep training methods designed for adults. CBT is the gold standard for treating insomnia. If you are the self-help type, you'll find much good info online.

These include keeping a consistent sleep schedule 7 days a week, especially important is a consistent wake time. Avoid napping or sleeping in, as these will in effect steal sleep from you at night. Also avoid caffeine in any form (including colas) after about mid-day. Be sure to get some good exercise most every day.

One time I had to go as long as 3 1/2 days without my medication and I didn't sleep at all or even get tired.\n\nI take a .3 of clonidine and when the ER doctor heard that he was confused and seemed in disbelief, when I told him it was for insomnia he kinda understood it seemed.\n\nMy question is what are the risks I am facing as a life long user of clonidine at such a dose? Is there anyway to cure it?

I don't treat these spasms, I just let them ride out. Sometimes they are so strong that I've kicked or elbowed my husband. He has learned to be prepared and to protect himself lol.

I just wanted you to know that I, too, have been prescribed Trazadone and it has worked quite well. I have taken only 50 mg for a while now because I am up and down all through the night with sleep issues. At first I was drowsy in the mornings from it, but my body adjusted and I wake up feeling fine. You might not have the same reaction, but it is a good med, non-addictive, and no side effects. I hope you got a good night's sleep with it. I did find out that one of the meds I'm taking was the problem causing the spasms. During the day I felt like my body and mind were in a continual hyper mode, so at bedtime I was constantly searching for ways to relax in order to try to get some sleep. I stopped taking that med and now I'm much better. If you're on other meds, also, you might ask your doctor if it's possible that one of them, or a combination of them, is causing this problem. It's good that you're questioning what your doctor told you about this being an anxiety issue. You know yourself better than anyone, and doctors' \"opinions\" are not always the one and only answer. If Trazadone is not the solution, keep searching for the one that IS the solution for you. I'll say a prayer for you that your health be restored so you can return to your normal lifestyle.

Awakening briefly between cycles is normal, everyone does it to some degree. Normally we fall right back asleep and forget about it by morning.\n\nThe urge to urinate at your age doesn't suggest prostate, but again your doc should have the best info on this. You should likely avoid drinking anything for at least a couple hours before bed, then be sure to void your bladder right before actually getting into bed.\n\nAs for the erection, again quite normal during the REM phase of sleep, which is consistent with awakening after completion of one of the cycles.\n\nIf you're not getting good answers from your doc, you might ask for a referral to a sleep specialist or urologist.\n\nBut I suspect your real issue is light, fragmented sleep, combined possibly with too much drinking before bed.

She had ran into the room, and before I tell you what happened after she went in I want to notify you that I did not wake up during or right after the incident and did not notice anything strange when I did wake up. So as I was saying, she went in and saw me choking in my sleep, even not breathing at all. She said she went on the bed next to me and tried grabbing my arms to shake or move me, but when she did she told me my muscles were VERY stiff. She told me she was afraid to even grab it and forcefully moved it because she though that if she did she would end up breaking something. So instead she grabbed my shoulders, started shaking me and screaming my name because she said that she had felt that my soul/spirit was drifting away as if I was dying in my sleep even. This has happened on 2 occasions and I'm worried it could be something serious or I have anything similar or do have sleep apnea. Like my arms she said my whole entire body was stiff like I was a statue. I wasn't even moving or slightly shaking but as I said, very stiff. This went on for what she had told me a few minutes and the scene ended. After I still stayed sleeping and I peacefully released my body from the stiff stance for the rest of the night.

Didn't lose bowel control or bite my tongue, but was extremely fatigued and ended up in the care of a fellow passenger who was a doctor till we landed and was taken off the plane and hospitalized for about 5 hours after landing.\n\nSince then, I saw my personal doctor and they sent me to a neurologist. I have since had my driver's license suspended for at least 3 months pending no further seizures, and no abnormal follow up test results. I was given an EKG, EEG, CT scan, and an MRI so far. All came back with no abnormal results. I still have a pending sleep study that will be looking for sleep apnea.\n\nI do not have a known cause yet, but I was out drinking the night before my flight and dealt with a big hangover, lack of good sleep, didn't eat much the whole day, and didn't drink a ton of water as I was nauseous that entire day leading up to my flight (the night after I was out drinking). I was told each one of those things can bring it about, but also stress of which I am awful about way over stressing about work and reserves work.\n\nThe whole reason for me bringing this up is that I have worked it out with my job to keep working with my license suspended, but I have to get to and from work under my own power and that makes me stay in a hotel within walking distance to my headquarters. Two times now since I started staying in this hotel I have had episodes of sleepwalking (that's the best way I know how to put it). In the middle of the night, I got up, not really aware of what I was doing at the time, needing to go use the bathroom and walked out of my hotel room to find a restroom. I ended up at the front desk with the help of some other person staying at the hotel and they took care of me and got me back in my room, but I had no idea what was going on and only loosely recall where I was and what I did. The hotel called my room the next day to check on me and that solidified to me what happened. That was the first time something like that ever happened to me and happened the first week I was in this hotel. The second time was last night, now two weeks later, but I put stuff in the way of my door to hopefully deter lucid me from making it outside again and it worked. I did randomly move things around the room and woke up on the couch instead of the hotel bed which I barely remember and was also paired with a dire urge to use the restroom in the middle of the night.\n\nI have no idea if these things could all be related.

A deep inner part of the brain known as the pons blocks signals from our brains to our spines, resulting in a form of paralysis. Sleep scientists theorize this is to keep us from physically acting out our dreams. So not having this reaction would actually be more of a problem.\n\nDuring the REM phase, males often experience an erection, females clitoral engorgement. For a guy your age to have a wet dream as you've described is not unusual at all. It more than likely will not be the last either, at least until you get a girl friend '-)\n\nYou can look up 'sleep cycles' for more info on this. Also 'hypnopompic hallucination', this typically is when we emerge from from a REM dream phase.\n\nAs for the soreness, cannot say for sure.

Since that night for a week afterwards I was extremely nervous to go to bed and was anxious in bed in case I struggled again to fall asleep which some nights I did. Once I get into bed too I don't feel like I want to go to sleep? After this I decided to cut caffeine out my diet and began to drink plenty of water so that my heart rate wasn't raised and the caffeine wouldn't disrupt my sleep. In addition to this I've been setting an alarm to get up earlier than usual so I don't oversleep. This has worked for a week I've been able to fall asleep so quickly with only a slight feeling of nervousness before bedtime. However, last night I've had the worst time falling asleep ever and it is currently 7 o'clock in the morning and I've literally not been to sleep. I lay in bed until about 4ish and then gave up. However, I don't feel as tired as I should for someone that hasn't slept all night? I am so annoyed because I've had such a good week of good sleep. I really don't understand what is going on with me and why this has suddenly began happening?\n\nIf I consider anything stressful in my life at the moment it would be that I've had to do a dissertation for university that has had me quite worried.

This suggests that you in fact did sleep, but weren't aware of it because you were, well, asleep.\n\nDon't worry about that. Very common. Happens to pretty much everyone. Called \"sleep state misperception\". And for you that sounds like it's part of the solution.\n\nMeaning worry less will help turn off the negative mental fuel that's perpetuating your insomnia. There are many ways to do this, including deep diaphragmatic breathing combined with progressive muscle relaxation, or even the time-tested method of simply counting sheep to distract yourself.\n\nYou should be confident that your mind-body system is sufficiently strong to get what sleep it requires no matter how much you worry. Hopefully that fact will help you let some of the negativity go.\n\nIf this continues to bother you, a checkup with your doc may be in order to either treat or eliminate the worry over the possibility of an underlying medical issue. But it's likely you have none, as the majority of insomnia is primary.\n\nLook also at CBT-based adult sleep training methods.

I discussed this with a former therapist and a Psychiatrist just to see if they thought it was something irrational and/or unattainable. They both grinned and nodded with excitement that I had figured this out and it was working for me. (That probably came out arrogant, but I don't meant it to be - just saying.)\n\nWhat do you think the #1 reason is that people get insomnia? It's not the only reason, but it's the primary and most common - the reason is that we don't turn off the \"conversations\" in our head. Period! We lay in bed and start thinking about something we are worrying about, or the project that needs to be complete by the end of the day tomorrow, or the person from 10 years ago who made you angry....and the list goes on. These are not just the simple thoughts that pop in our head, but the thoughts that turn in to self-conversations wherein one topic leads to another, and to another. A person simply CANNOT sleep when those \"conversations\" are taking over our mind!\n\nSo how can we make it stop? Is it possible to make it stop? The answer to that is a resounding YES!\n\nI've had insomnia for at least 26 years, and I took sleeping pills for a majority of that time. Not daily, but almost daily. My insomnia was medication induced so I figured that I was doomed. I mean, if insomnia is a side effect of my medication and I can't stop taking that medication, then I guess I'm stuck with insomnia, right? NO!\n\nI started to think about why I have insomnia other than medication, and the answer was obvious - I can't turn my brain off. So I followed it through and thought, \"So if conversations in my head is what's keeping me awake, then I need to somehow learn to stop with the conversations.\" So easy! NOT! I am a thinker who has a hard time turning it off! How the heck am I supposed to turn my mind off so I can sleep? I had no idea, but I came up with a system that worked for me.\n\nAs soon as my head hits the pillow, I tell myself that it's not time for conversations, but it's time to sleep. Obviously, none of us can totally turn off our thoughts, but we CAN stop the \"conversations.\" As soon as I start taking a thought further, I force myself to STOP. Two seconds later it or another thought comes up, and I do the same - I stop myself from carrying on that \"conversation\" in my head. For me, the first few nights was difficult because I also stopped taking sleeping pills, but after those few days, I got better and better at it until I was able to get to sleep every night without a sleeping pill! Some nights were harder than others and I sometimes I have to be more disciplined to do it, but it works! Therapy that is specifically for insomnia called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Insomnia (CBT-I) goes along the same premise, though it gives more ideas and tools of how to do it.\n\nNow that I\"ve rambled on enough, I would give it a try. It won't be easy at first, and in fact, may feel impossible; but if you can somehow make yourself discipline yourself past the initial part of it, you may find yourself getting better at it. Don't expect it to happen overnight, but it really does work. Not just for me, but the principle is universal.\n\nSleep well :)\n\nDebbie\n"},{"author":"kamalsingh21","resp_time":"over 2 years ago","resp_title":"RE: insomnia","resp_content":"You can retrain your brain.

It happens when I'm just about ready to fall asleep and then it will start. Its not a pain or a twinge or an uneasy leg. Its not constant but comes in a cycle about every 7-10 seconds and it doesn't happen all the time. Its this uncomfortable non painful withdrawal type of uneasy feeling that just makes you uncomfortable throughout mostly the middle part of your body seemingly emanating mostly from between the legs and prostate area but will also effect arms and hands. Its like the blood in those parts every 10 seconds or so just is uncomfortable and very annoying to where you can't be comfortable enough to sleep. Im sorry its hard to explain. Its weird because if i stand up or walk around i can't sense it. It only happens when I lay relaxed in bed. If you move when it happens it will kind of subside but like i said it'll come back around in 7-10 seconds. It kind of makes you want to stretch or kind of flex the area that it effects to deal with it when it comes. When I first starting getting it I thought it was alcohol withdrawals of some kind and it centered in the lower genital anal area. Its been effecting me for years now and it will move up into the arms and hands at times and it so uncomfortable. The arms and hands area makes the hands a little tickle and light but just makes you want to make a fist when it comes. The only thing that has seemed to help it when it comes is head to the fridge and chow down on food and snacks because it feels like my body needs something. And usually that will take care of it but lately it hasn't. I don't have any medical conditions and I haven't drank in over a week and it hit me last night bad so its not alcohol related i don't believe.

One thing that was overlooked for years was the fact that I have sleep apnea. With it, you literally stop breathing many times a night. When I was tested, I was only getting the equivalent of 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I was always tired, and as I got older, it started to negatively affect my health. I would get run down and get sick, then after a few days in bed, I would recover. Mainly because I was \"catching up\". The underlying part of that is that with sleep apnea, you don't get into your REM sleep cycle, or it comes late in the cycle about the time to get up. If you arise before you have REM, you miss it, and that compromises your immune system.\n\nThe amount of caffeine you consume is not helping, but actually making things worse. Excessive consumption can actually bring on fatigue. It takes a while to cut back on caffeine, but I encourage you to pursue this.\n\nI am 66 now, and I can't believe how much better my life was after I started using a CPAP machine. It took me until I was 56 to figure this out. Don't let your life be wasted by fatigue. Depression could also be part of the equation and you should consider seeing a doctor for assessment. There is no stigma to taking anti-depressants or having sleep therapy anymore, and it can make your life much more balanced as well.

I follow all my pain doctors and VA doctors advice for the dosage and do not take more than prescribed ever.

You should not make any changes on your own without discussing with your doc, as there could be unintended consequences.\n\nRegarding your sleep, beware so-called \"sleep tracker\" devices. They are notoriously unreliable. The gold standard is PSG, where you are hooked up to a number of physical monitors, and typically these trackers are nowhere close to PSG results. That probably means you are in fact sleeping longer, and possibly quite a bit longer, than you think you are. Sleep state misperception is very common. Insomniacs typically sleep about an hour or more than they think they sleep.\n\nThat said, your best advice will come from your doc who examines you and knows your medical history. None of us do.

It would take too long to describe all so will keep it to the so-called recent past. 8 years ago my Mom was diagnosed with colon cancer. I had moved her to my place from So. CA, USA to No. CA, USA. When she grew ill once she was out of the hospital (after a month, in which I sat bed side daily) I tried to take care of her at home. Even ended up sleeping with her, so I could hear her call for assistance if she needed it. I was sleeping ok, but naturally was tired from the stress. She passed, scared and in a convalescent home. I lost my home and had to live in an RV. Moved from an RV park due to close living and no privacy. When there at RV park, I started getting panic attacks at night which would wake me up. Sought out Psych. Doctor. Gave me buproprion and klonopin. The klonopin was taken when the panic attack would awake me nightly. I moved. sadly I ended up on an illegal pot farm with other tenants who abused heavy drugs and alcohol and fought physically at times. My land lady was a narcissist and would scream and be delusional and just plain mean. She hated I'm a vegan and generally a quiet, keep to myself person and would badger me. I could not move due to financial reasons, although I kept looking. One cannot live looking over one's should daily and avoiding or trying to, the harassment and yes, at time sexual advances from other tenants.\nMany tenants came and went due to the activity on property. (lucky them!) I lived with this for over 7 years and except for exactly 6 'windows' of normal sleep, I never had a restful nights sleep. Kept seeking out new doctors to help to no avail. After 7 1/2 years I finally got subsidized housing and it is far, far better than where I had been and I thought I would get better. I'm better in that I'm not being harassed and am beginning to make friends though I need much quiet time. BUT I still spend nights shaking and awaken very early and pace the floor, so I turn on TV and make my morning health shake (plant proteins/banana/blueberries) These activities ease the shaking but I'm so very tired of never getting quality sleep. No one seems to be able to help. I just got a new Doctor and had a blood panel done and will see him in a week or so. I don't want to go on more drugs. He understands that and will try and work with me. I take magnesium, B12, tryptophan, melatonin and a herbal tincture for sleep aid.

So actually getting referred to a sleep lab twice is unusual as it is fluffed off as \"who isn't tired?\"\nThe first lab is to rule out sleep apnea among other sleep disorders and second to rule out Narcolepsy (where in addition to sleeping overnight, one is to take 4 naps all of which I fell asleep in under a minute after 8 hours of sleeping the previous night).\nThis lab test shows the way Narcolepsy sleep patterns function.\nIn a non-narcoleptic sleep cycle the person will fall asleep without much trouble though it may take about 15-20 minutes. Then once asleep they will reach REM sleep in approximately 4hours. Then they will slowly cycle up toward a wakened state but never very close. Throughout the night they will head down into REM slightly sooner then the sleep cycle prior and sooner and sooner as the night progresses. We dream in REM sleep though don't recall these dreams as REM is reached more gradually than in Narcoleptics. Many people surprisingly say they don't dream. They do. It simply means that they don't remember dreaming. For those of you who remember dreaming it is in the early morning as our sleep cycles shorten and reaching REM becomes quickest. Wakefulness and Dreaming often blend together and we remember dreams that were most likely only seconds but felt like hours.\nFor Narcoleptics, we reach our first REM in under one minute and wake up and these cycles repeat all night long. Creating confusion between what is a dream and what is real, causing terrifying night terrors, sleep paralysis and many other things.\nFor example I will reach for a drink of water, fall asleep while still holding the glass, dream that what's in my hand is something else and drop it all over me, the bed and the floor. I try to stay awake to clean up the mess and fall asleep and wake up on the other side of my room.\nSo, there are pharmaceuticals that can help us to try and stay asleep \"fake sleep\" and meds that try and keep us awake during the day \"fake awake\". Never do we ever achieve actual restorative sleep.\nThink of when you missed one nights sleep, does your brain function well the next day? No! You may experience blurry vision, social or other anxiety and many other hindrances. Narcoleptics describe as I have, double vision, confusion, hallucinations and always a desire to sit at least if not lye down to avoid falling over. (Btw never enough seats provided in public places.) It is one of several \"invisible\" illnesses where people say you look well, while inside you are feeling horrible.\nPeople also say \"Oh, I get tired too!\" Which may come from an empathetic place though Narcolepsy is much more than being tired. The truth is even when we tell someone that we have Narcolepsy, most people just stare at you because most people don't know what it is.\nSo my end point to this long message if you made it here is to never judge others. We just don't have all the facts to make those assumptions. Also if you have experienced trouble sleeping for more than 2 weeks see a doctor and ask for a referral to a sleep lab.\nI went to rule out sleep apnea and discovered this.

I had a balloon sinuplasty 2 weeks ago due to chronic sinusitus. I do not have a deviated septum. The procedure was incredibly uncomfortable (I would never do it out-patient if I would've known the amount of pain I'd feel), the first week was terrible, and I am still experiencing excruciating facial pressure, particularly in my cheeks, which comes in waves. I have already switched ENTs since the ENT who did the procedure told me it was okay to have an 8-hour nosebleed on the day of the procedure (not just tinted with blood but blood literally running down my face like a sieve) and a 3-hour bleed a week later after he attempted to pull one of my scabs off (he was wrong and I lost enough blood that my hemoglobin level is now below-normal). My new ENT is great and wants to look more at my allergies (I am allergic to some molds) but I am curious if anyone else had this much pain following this procedure. She started me on a course of antibiotics today and I'm hoping it helps because I'm taking Tylenol every 4 hours and waking up in the middle of the night with incredible pain once it wears off. I use saline nasal spray four times a day, follow an anti-inflammatory diet, do acupressure, use steam/warm moist heat packs on my face, and use the neti pot when not suffering from nosebleeds. I had to stop Motrin/other NSAIDS because they were partly responsible for the severity of the nosebleeds I had post-op. I just keep reading hw people go back to work the next day and I am astounded.
